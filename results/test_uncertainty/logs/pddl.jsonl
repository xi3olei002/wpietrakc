  "example_prompt": "You are a robot with a gripper that can move objects between different rooms. Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

  "example_prompt": "You are a robot with a gripper that can move objects between different rooms. Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room.

Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room.

The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

  "example_prompt": "You are a robot with a gripper that can move objects between different rooms. Your name is Robby.\n    There are three actions defined in this domain:\n    move <room1> <room2>: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.\n    pick <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.\n    drop <obj> <room> <gripper>: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free.\n\nHere are examples:\nThe goal is to satisfy the following conditions: ball1 is at roomb. , ball2 is at roomb. , ball3 is at roomb. \nObservation: Ball1 is a ball.

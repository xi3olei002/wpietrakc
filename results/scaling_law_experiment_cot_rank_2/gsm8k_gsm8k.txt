[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the known information: there are 40 cannolis and Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis, so we can set up an equation:

Corn = 2 * 40 = 80

Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns, so we can subtract 40 from the existing corn: 80 - 40 = 40

Allan now has 40 cannolis from before + 60 new cannolis + 40 corns = 140 cannolis + 40 corns = 180

Combined total of corns and cannolis is 180.  The answer is 180.

[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means that he was x years old 5 years ago.  Since he is twice as old as he was then, that means he is 2x years old now. 

We know that x + 5 = 2x, because the equation is saying that Jerry's current age (2x) is 5 years more than his age 5 years ago (x). 

We can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides of the equation:

x + 5 = 2x

x - x = 2x - 5

0 = x - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

x = 5

So Jerry was 5 years old 5 years ago.  Since he is twice as old as he was then, he is 2x = 2(5) = 10 years old now. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means that he was x years old 5 years ago.  Since he is twice as old as he was then, that means he is 2x years old now. 

We know that x + 5 = 2x, because the equation is saying that Jerry's current age (2x) is 5 years more than his age 5 years ago (x). 

We can solve for x by subtracting x from both sides of the equation:

x + 5 = 2x

x - x = 2x - 5

0 = x - 5

Add 5 to both sides:

x = 5

So Jerry was 5 years old 5 years ago.  Since he is twice as old as he was then, he is 2x = 2(5) = 10 years old now. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Sally earns $0. 50 more than Billy's starting salary of $10.  So Sally earns $10. 50/hour, which is the same as Billy's rate after his first raise. 

Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.  We need to multiply their rates by the hours worked to find their total pay. 

Billy's pay is $11. 50 x 20 hours = $230. 

Sally's pay is $10. 50 x 20 hours = $210. 

To find how much Billy earns more, we subtract Sally's pay from Billy's: $230 - $210 = $20. 

The answer is 20.

First, James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.  To find the distance he swims, multiply 20 by 60% (which is the same as 0. 6):

20 x 0. 6 = 12 miles

So James swims 12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour.  To find the time it takes him to swim this distance, divide the distance by his speed:

12 miles / 2 miles per hour = 6 hours

So James swims for 6 hours, and then stops to rest.  The time he rests is half of the swimming time, which is:

6 hours / 2 = 3 hours

After resting for 3 hours, James continues swimming the remaining distance.  The remaining distance is the whole lake minus the distance he already swam, which is:

20 miles - 12 miles = 8 miles

James swims this distance at half his original speed, which is:

2 miles per hour / 2 = 1 mile per hour

To find the time it takes him to swim this distance, divide the distance by his speed:

8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours

Add the time James spends swimming, resting, and finishing the remaining distance to find the total time:

6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (finishing remaining distance) = 17 hours

The answer is 17 hours.

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Let x be the number of large stuffed animals sold. 
Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x. 

The problem states that each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the total revenue from small stuffed animals is 2x ร 4 = 8x. 

The problem also states that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals, so the price of large stuffed animals is 3 ร 4 = $12. 
The total revenue from large stuffed animals is x ร 12 = 12x. 

The total revenue from both types of stuffed animals is $120, so we can set up the equation:
8x + 12x = 120
Combine like terms:
20x = 120
Divide both sides by 20:
x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals. 

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, Teresa sold 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12.

When the T-Rex left, the velociraptors found half of that, which is x/2. 

When the Allosaurus ate, they ate half of what the velociraptors found, which is x/4.

Let's call the number of cupcakes "x".  Then, we can substitute x for "cupcakes" in the equation:

brownies = 3 * x - 2

Next, we know that the total number of treats (cupcakes and brownies) is 5 * 2 = 10, since each person gets two treats.  We can set up an equation for the total number of treats:

cupcakes + brownies = 10

We can substitute the expression for brownies in terms of x:

x + (3 * x - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4 * x - 2 = 10

Add 2 to both sides:

4 * x = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14400, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many days the builder works in a year.  He works for 4 weeks every month and 6 days every week, so in a month he works 4 * 6 = 24 days.  There are 12 months in a year, so in a year he works 24 * 12 = 288 days.  

If he earns $50 every day, he earns 288 * 50 = 14400 dollars in a year.  The answer is 14400. 
 First, let's calculate how many days the builder works in a month.  He works 4 weeks and 6 days per week, so 4 x 6 = 24 days in a month.  In a year, there are 12 months, so he works 12 x 24 = 288 days in a year. 

If he earns $50 per day, then his total earnings in a year will be 288 x 50 = 14400.  The answer is 14400. 
 First, we need to find out how many days the builder works in a month.  He works for 4 weeks per month, and 6 days per week.  So the number of days he works in a month is 4 x 6 = 24 days.  Now, he gets $50 per day.  So in a month, he earns 24 x 50 = 1200 dollars.  Since he works for a year (12 months), he earns a total of 12 x 1200 = 14400 dollars.  The answer is 14400. 
 A builder works for 4 weeks a month, and 6 days a week.  So he works a total of 4 * 6 = 24 days per month.  There are 12 months in a year.  So he works 24 * 12 = 288 days per year.  He gets $50 per day so his total earnings per year will be 288 * 50 = 14400.  The answer is 14400. 
 The builder works for 4 weeks every month.  There are 12 months in a year.  So in a year, the builder works 4 * 12 = 48 weeks.  The builder also works 6 days a week.  Therefore, the builder works 48 * 6 = 288 days in a year. 

The builder is paid 50 dollars every day.  To find out how much he earns in a year, we can multiply the number of days he works in a year by his daily wage:

288 days * 50 dollars/day = 14400 dollars

The answer is 14400 dollars.

[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Mark is making quadruple the recipe, so he needs 3*4 = 12 cups of flour and 1*4 = 4 cups of milk.  Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, he will need 12/2 = 6 bags.  Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, he will need 4/2 = 2 bottles.  To find out how many more bags of flour he needs than bottles of milk, we need to subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags.  6 - 2 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
 Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies.  For the normal recipe, he needs 3 cups of flour.  For a quadruple batch, he will need 3 x 4 = 12 cups of flour.  Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so he will need 12 / 2 = 6 bags. 

For milk, he will need 1 cup for the normal recipe and 1 x 4 = 4 cups for the quadruple batch.  Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so he will need 4 / 2 = 2 bottles. 

Mark will need 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.  He needs 6 - 2 = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.  The answer is 4. 
 Mark is making a quadruple batch, so he needs 4 times the normal amount of ingredients. 

For flour: normal amount is 3 cups, so quadrupling it is 3 x 4 = 12 cups.  Since flour comes in 2-cup bags, he needs 12 / 2 = 6 bags. 

For milk: normal amount is 1 cup, so quadrupling it is 1 x 4 = 4 cups.  Since milk comes in 2-cup bottles, he needs 4 / 2 = 2 bottles. 

Mark has to buy 6 bags of flour and 2 bottles of milk.  So to find the difference in bags and bottles, subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags: 6 - 2 = 4. 

The answer is 4.

[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 81, [output]: 1 hour, the AC uses 900 watts.  8 hours a day is 8 * 900 = 7200 watts.  If Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the AC uses 3 hours instead.  So it uses 3 * 900 = 2700 watts.  So it uses 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts less each day.  In 30 days, that is 30 * 4500 = 135000 watts.  Since there are 1000 watts in a kilowatt, 135000 watts is 135 kilowatts.  The answer is 135. 
1 hour is 900 watts.  8 hours a day is 8 x 900 = 7200 watts.  So in a day, Mel is using 7200 watts of energy.  If he reduces the time to 3 hours, then he is using 3 x 900 = 2700 watts.  He is saving 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts of energy.  To convert watts to kilowatts, we divide by 1000.  4500 / 1000 = 4. 5 kilowatts.  30 days means 30 times that amount, so 30 x 4. 5 = 135 kilowatts.  The answer is 135. 
1 watt is 0. 001 kilowatts.  900 watts is 0. 9 kilowatts.  If the AC uses 0. 9 kilowatts for 8 hours, then it uses 0. 9 x 8 = 7. 2 kilowatts.  

If he shifts his usage by 5 hours, then the new usage will be 8 - 5 = 3 hours.  So the new usage will be 3 x 0. 9 = 2. 7 kilowatts. 

He will save 7. 2 - 2. 7 = 4. 5 kilowatts of energy each day.  For 30 days, he will save 4. 5 x 30 = 135 kilowatts of energy. 

The answer is 135. 
900 watts is the energy used by the air conditioner per hour.  Since Mel uses it for 8 hours a day, he uses 8 x 900 = 7200 watts per day.  Reducing the usage by 5 hours a day, he uses 3 hours a day.  The energy used per hour remains the same, 900 watts.  So the energy used in a day is 3 x 900 = 2700 watts.  Daily energy saved per day is 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts.  In 30 days, energy saved is 4500 watts/day x 30 days = 135,000.  The answer is 135,000 watts. 
900 watts of energy per hour times 8 hours a day is 900 x 8 = 7200 watts used per day.  If he reduces the day by 5 hours, he will use 8 - 5 = 3 hours a day.  900 x 3 = 2700 watts per day.  Now, 7200 - 2700 is 4500 watts saved every day.  In 30 days, it will be 4500 x 30 = 135,000 watts.  Watts are a unit of power and kilowatts are 1000 watts.  135,000 watts divided by 1000 is 135.  The answer is 135.

[EXP] 5: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 2 zebras with 17 stripes each have a total of 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.  1 zebra with 36 stripes is 36 stripes.  1 more zebra with half that (36/2 = 18) is 18 stripes.  In total, 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.  With 4 zebras, the average is 88/4 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
 Jane counted 2 zebras with 17 stripes each, so 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.  Then there was one more with 36 stripes.  And another one with 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  So the total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.  There are 4 zebras in total, so the average number of stripes per zebra is 88 / 4.  88 / 4 is 22.  The answer is 22. 
2 zebras with 17 stripes each means there are 17 x 2 = 34 stripes from those zebras.  There is 36 stripes from the third zebra.  The fourth zebra has half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18.  So in total there are 34 + 36 + 18 = 88 stripes.  We are asked to find the average, so we divide by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
 First, find the total number of stripes.  Each of the two zebras with 17 stripes has 17 stripes, so that is 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.  The third zebra with 36 stripes, and the fourth with half that many would be 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  The total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.  Since there are 4 zebras, the average is the total number of stripes divided by the number of zebras.  88 / 4 is 22.  The answer is 22. 
2 zebras with 17 stripes each have a total of 2 * 17 = 34 stripes.  The zebra with 36 stripes adds 36 more stripes to the total, for a total of 34 + 36 = 70 stripes.  The other zebra has half the stripes of the zebra with 36, so that is 36 / 2 = 18 more stripes.  In total, the zebras have 70 + 18 = 88 stripes.  Since there are 4 zebras total, the average is 88 / 4 = 22.  The answer is 22.

[EXP] 7: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 200, [output]: 40 cannolis originally.  Then 60 more cannolis are bought.  So now Allan has 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.  There are twice as many corns as cannolis.  So originally there were 40 * 2 = 80 corns.  After 40 fewer corns are bought, there are 80 - 40 = 40 corns left.  Altogether, there are 100 cannolis and 40 corns.  100 + 40 = 140.  The answer is 140. 
40 cannolis.  Therefore, there are twice as many corns.  So 40 x 2 = 80 corns.  Allan bought 60 cannolis and 40 fewer corns.  So 40 - 40 = 0 new corns.  So the total number of corns is 80 - 40 = 40.  Then add the new corns and cannolis: 40 + 100 = 140.  The answer is 140. 
Final Answer: The final answer is 140.  I hope it is correct. 
 Since there are twice as many corns as cannolis, that means there are 2x corns where x is the number of cannolis.  At first, there are 40 cannolis.  

40 cannolis means 40 x 2 = 80 corns.  But Allan bought 40 fewer corns so now there are 80 - 40 = 40 corns.  

He bought 60 cannolis more.  So there are 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis.  

The total corns he has is 40.  The combined total of corns and cannolis is 40 + 100 = 140.  The answer is 140.

Toby can read 300 words per minute.  In 60 minutes, he can read 60 x 300 = 18000 words.  Since there are 9000 words in the book, Toby will finish reading it in 9000/300 = 30 minutes.  To get to the airport, it takes 10 more minutes.  So Toby will arrive at the airport in 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.  The answer is 20. 
 Firstly, we need to calculate the total words in the book. 

45 pages * 200 words/page = 9000 words

Since Toby can read 300 words per minute, we need to find out how many minutes it will take him to read the whole book:

9000 words / 300 words/min = 30 minutes

It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport after finishing the book.  So Toby will finish the book at 30 + 10 = 40 minutes.  However, he plans to be at the airport in 60 minutes.  He will be:

60 - 40 = 20 minutes early

In June, 1/4 of the employees left, which is 40 * 1/4 = 10 employees.  The remaining 40 - 10 = 30 employees continued to work.  Each of them worked 40 hours, so the total hours worked in June is 30 * 40 = 1200 hours.  Each hour was still paid 15 dollars, so the total amount paid in June is 1200 * 15 = 18,000 dollars. 

The total amount paid in both months is 24,000 + 18,000 = 42,000 dollars.  The answer is 42,000. 
40 employees were hired in May, and each worked 40 hours a week.  So in total they worked 40 employees * 40 hours = 1600 hours.  1600 hours * 15 dollars per hour = 24,000 dollars in May.  For June, 3/4 of the 40 employees were still employed (1/4 left because 1/4 of their contracts expired).  So there were 30 employees in June.  These 30 employees worked for 4 weeks in June (June has 4 weeks), which is 30 employees * 40 hours = 1200 hours.  1200 hours * 15 dollars per hour = 18,000 dollars in June.  The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June is 24,000 + 18,000 = 42,000 dollars.  The answer is 42,000.

For the second pound, it costs 3 - 1. 5 = 1. 5 dollars since it's one half off.  3 + 1. 5 = 4. 5.  Then she bought a mixed bag of seashells for 1. 5 dollars and 4 magnets for 4 * 0. 25 = 1 dollar.  So 4. 5 + 1. 5 + 1 = 7 dollars.  She spent 7 dollars and has 10 - 7 = 3 dollars left.  The answer is 3. 
 Sally had 10 dollars.  First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy.  She bought 2 pounds.  For the first 1 pound, she paid 3 dollars.  For the second 1/2 pound, she got 1/2 pound for 1/2 off, which means it cost 3/2 dollars, and 3/2 dollars is 1. 50 dollars.  So the total cost of taffy is 3 + 1. 5 = 4. 5 dollars.  She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for 1. 50 and 4 magnets for 0. 25 each.  4 magnets for 0. 25 each means 0. 25 x 4 = 1 dollar.  The total cost of the seashells and magnets is 1. 50 + 1 = 2. 5 dollars.  The total money she spent is 4. 5 + 2. 5 = 7 dollars.  So she has 10 - 7 = 3 dollars left.  The answer is 3. 
 Sally has 10 dollars originally.  For the taffy, the initial price for 1 pound is 3 dollars.  For another half pound, she got a discount, which is half of 3, which is 3/2, or 1. 5 dollars.  So for 2 pounds, she paid 3 + 1. 5 = 4. 5 dollars.  She also bought a seashell bag for 1. 5 dollars and 4 magnets for 0. 25 each, which is 0. 25 * 4 = 1 dollar.

So the cost after discount is 1200 - 240 = 960.  Then add the finale firework that costs 150 dollars.  So the total is 960 + 150 = 1110.  The answer is 1110. 
400 is the cost of the first package, and the cost of the second package is twice that much, so it is 2 x 400 = 800.  The total cost without the discount is 400 + 800 = 1200.  With a 20% discount, the discount is 20% of 1200 = 0. 2 x 1200 = 240 dollars.  So the final cost will be 1200 - 240 = 960.  Plus the finale firework, the total cost is 960 + 150 = 1110.  The answer is 1110. 
 Let's start by finding the value of the two packs of fireworks.  The first pack is $400.  The second pack is $400 x 2 = $800.  In total, the packs are $400 + $800 = $1200.  He gets a 20% discount, so the discount is 20% of $1200, which is $240.  The price without the discount is $1200, but with the discount, it's $1200 - $240 = $960.  Adding the finale firework that costs $150, the total amount spent is $960 + $150 = $1110.  The answer is 1110. 
 Tim buys a first package for 400 dollars.  Then he buys another one worth twice that much, which is 2 * 400 = 800.  So the cost of the packages is 400 + 800 = 1200.  With a 20% discount, that discount is 0. 20 * 1200 = 240.  1200 - 240 = 960.  Then adding the 150 dollar finale firework, the total cost is 960 + 150 = 1110 dollars.  The answer is 1110. 
400 dollars is the first pack of fireworks.  The second pack of fireworks is twice as much, so 400 x 2 = 800.  400 + 800 is 1200, so the total price before the 20% discount is 1200.  20% off 1200 is 0. 8 x 1200 = 960.  After the discount, the fireworks cost 960 dollars.  The finale firework costs 150 dollars.  Adding that to the cost of the fireworks makes the total 960 + 150 = 1110 dollars.  The answer is 1110.

 Shannon wants to make enough cookies for 30 days.  She eats 2 cookies a night, so for 30 days she will need 2 * 30 cookies = 60 cookies.  Her recipe makes 1 dozen cookies = 12 cookies.  So we need to find out how many dozens she needs to make.  

60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.  

The answer is 5. 
 Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, and she wants to make sure she has enough cookies to last her for 30 days.  In 30 days, she will eat 2 cookies a night x 30 nights = 60 cookies.  The recipe makes 1 dozen cookies at a time.  60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5 dozens.  The answer is 5. 
1 dozen cookies is 12 cookies.  Since Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, in 30 days she will eat 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.  She needs to make enough cookies to make 60, since she will store the remainder in the freezer.  60 cookies / 12 cookies per dozen = 5.  The answer is 5.

[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]: 5% of the candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, and 1% don't meet the 99% guarantee not to explode.  These are not mutually exclusive events, so there's a chance that a candle both smells like wet dog and explodes. 

To solve this, we need to find 5% of 50000, which is 0. 05 x 50000 = 2500 candles that have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog.  Then, we need to find 1% of 50000, which is 0. 01 x 50000 = 500 candles that don't meet the guarantee not to explode.  But we're looking for the intersection of these two groups, so we need to find the intersection of 2500 and 500. 

One way to do this is to find the overlap of these two groups.  Since 500 candles are guaranteed to not explode, and 50000 - 2500 = 44500 candles are not defective, there are 44500 - 500 = 44000 candles that are not guaranteed to explode but do smell like wet dog.  Therefore, the answer is 0. 

There are no candles that both smell like wet dog and explode.

 The blouses are 30% off, which means they are 70% of their original price.  So each blouse is 20 * 0. 7 = 14 dollars.  If Misha buys 4, the total cost is 4 * 14 = 56.  The answer is 56. 
30% off means that Misha gets 30% off from the original price.  30% of 20 is 0. 3 x 20 = 6.  So each blouse is discounted by 6.  The discounted price of each blouse is 20 - 6 = 14.  Since Misha buys 4 blouses, the total cost is 4 x 14 = 56.  The answer is 56. 
30% off means 30% discount.  So we have to calculate 30% of 20 dollars.  30% of 20 is 6.  The discounted price is 20 - 6 = 14.  Since Misha picked 4 blouses, the total cost is 4 x 14 = 56.  The answer is 56. 
30% off is the same as 0. 7 or 7/10.  So the discounted price of each blouse is $20 * 0. 7 = $14.  If Misha bought 4 blouses, the total cost would be 14 * 4 = $56.  The answer is 56. 
1) The blouses are 30% off, so Misha will pay 70% of the original price.  70% of $20 is $14.  The total cost for 4 blouses is 4 x $14 = $56.  The answer is 56. 
30% off means we need to calculate 30% of the total original price and subtract it from the total price.  For 4 blouses, the total original price would be 4 x 20 = 80.  30% of 80 would be 0. 3 x 80 = 24.  Subtract 24 from 80 to get 56.  The answer is 56.

[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 350, [output]:  Joanne starts by gathering 30 apples from the tallest trees.  Her sister gathers twice as many, which is 30 x 2 = 60.  The total apples they gathered from tallest trees is 30 + 60 = 90 apples. 

Next, Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15.  Her sister gathers 3 times as many from the shortest trees, which is 15 x 3 = 45.  The total apples they gathered from the shortest trees is 15 + 45 = 60. 

They gathered a total of 90 + 60 = 150 apples from the tallest and shortest trees.  They gathered a total of 500 apples in total.  So the amount from average trees is 500 - 150 = 350 apples. 

The answer is 350. 
 lets start by making a equation for Joanne gathering apples

Let J = apples gathered by Joanne
Half of the tall trees apples are J/2
Adding J to J/2 and average trees yet unknown number of apples, we get a total of 500 apples. 
J + J/2 + Average = 500

Now let's try to find the total amount of apples gathered by Joanne and her sister from the tallest and shortest trees.  Since Joanne gathers 30 from the tallest trees and her sister gathers twice as many, it's 30 * 2 = 60 for the sister.  So 30 + 60 = 90 apples gathered from the tallest trees. 

Joanne gathers half from the shortest trees which is 30/2 = 15.  Her sister gathers 3 times as many which is 3 * 15 = 45.  So 15 + 45 = 60 apples gathered from the shortest trees. 

Now what remains is just the average trees.  Since we have a total of 500 apples, we can subtract the apples from the tallest and shortest trees.  500 - 90 - 60 = 350 apples remaining. 

Those apples were gathered from the average trees.  The answer is 350.

[EXP] 17: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 56, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each.  This means that the total number of humps (304) can be split into humps from camels and humps from dromedaries.  Since camels have two humps each, the number of camels can be represented as 304 ÷ 2 = 152.  So, there are 152 camels.  To find the number of dromedaries, subtract the number of camels from the total number of heads (180).  180 - 152 = 28.  Therefore, there are 28 dromedaries.  The answer is 28. 
304 bumps split into two types: humps on camels and humps on dromedaries. 

Camels have 2 humps each.  So the humps on camels represent 304 / 2 = 152 heads of camels. 

The remaining heads in the herd are dromedaries.  Since each dromedary has 1 hump, the dromedaries represent 180 - 152 = 28 heads. 

The answer is 28.

[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3140, [output]:  Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days, so he traveled 4 x 200 = 800 kilometers in the first 4 days. 

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, which is 0. 3 x 800 = 240 kilometers. 

The next day, he didn't travel at all.  So, in the first week, he traveled a total of 800 + 240 + 0 = 1040 kilometers. 

During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days, so he traveled a total of 7 x 300 = 2100 kilometers in the second week. 

To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we add the distance traveled in the first week to that in the second week: 1040 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers.  The answer is 3140 kilometers. 
 Tom traveled 200 km each day for 4 days.  So he traveled 200 * 4 = 800 km in the first 4 days.  Then, he traveled 30% of that amount over the next 2 days.  30% of 800 is 0. 30 * 800 = 240 km.  800 + 240 = 1040.  He didn't travel the next day, so the total from the first week is 1040 km. 

In the second week, he traveled 300 km each day.  So he traveled 300 * 7 = 2100 km in the second week.  The total distance he traveled over the two-week trip is 1040 + 2100 = 3140 km.  The answer is 3140.

[EXP] 19: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 5 cubic inches is Peter's locker, and it's 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.  So Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.  Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's, then Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.  The answer is 40. 
 Let's start with what we know.  Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.  Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's since 4 x 5 = 20.  Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches. 

Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Timothy's locker is 2 x 20 = 40 cubic inches. 

The answer is 40. 
 Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.  Zack's locker is 4 times larger, since Peter's locker is 1/4 of Zack's locker.  5 x 4 = 20.  So Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.  Zack's locker is half of Timothy's locker.  So Timothy's locker is 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.  The answer is 40. 
 Let's start by finding the size of Zack's locker.  We know Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's, and it's 5 cubic inches.  So Zack's locker is 4 times bigger than Peter's, or 4 x 5 = 20 cubic inches. 

Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's, we can double Zack's locker to find Timothy's: 20 x 2 = 40 cubic inches. 

The answer is 40.

Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. 
Zack's locker is 4 times bigger because 4 x 5 = 20. 
Timothy's locker is 2 times bigger than Zack's locker because it is twice as big as Zack's locker.  So it is 2 x 20 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
 Let's follow the problem.  We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.  We know Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.  So if Peter's locker is 5, then Zack's locker is 5 x 4 = 20 cubic inches. 

Now, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.  So Timothy's locker must be twice as big as Zack's locker.  Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches, so Timothy's locker must be 20 x 2 = 40 cubic inches. 

The answer is 40.

 Stanley was at 10,000 feet, but the comb fell 4,000 feet.  So Stanley's comb is at 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.  Oliver has to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.  The answer is 3,000. 
 Stanley was originally at 10,000 feet.  The comb fell 4000 feet.  So Stanley is now at 10,000 - 4,000 feet which is 6,000 feet.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet.  So Oliver has to climb 6,000 - 3,000 feet which is 3,000 feet.  The answer is 3,000. 
10,000 is the elevation where Stanley was standing.  4,000 feet down is where the comb fell, so 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000.  This is the elevation where Stanley's comb is.  Oliver is at 3,000 feet, so he needs to climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.  The answer is 3,000. 
 Stanley was standing at an elevation of 10,000 feet.  The comb fell 4,000 feet and Stanley's brother Oliver was at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  So Stanley's comb is at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet.  Oliver must climb to 6,000 - 3,000 feet to reach the comb.  6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.  The answer is 3,000. 
 Stanley was 10,000 feet high and lost a comb 4,000 feet down, which means the comb is now at 6,000 feet.  Since Oliver is 3,000 feet high, to reach the elevation of the comb he must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet.  The answer is 3,000. 
10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 feet is the elevation of Stanley's lost comb.  So the difference between Stanley's original elevation (10,000 feet) and the ledge below (4,000 feet) is 6,000.  Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.  To get to 6,000 feet, he has to climb 6,000 - 3,000 feet.  6,000 - 3,000 is 3,000.  The answer is 3,000.

[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.  So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22. 

2.  Cole saved a total of $6.  The question says he saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.  So, we can set up the equation:

(1/3)(x) + (1 - (1/3))(tattered jeans) = 6

where x is the savings from the jogger jeans and tattered jeans is the price of the tattered jeans. 

3.  Simplifying the equation, we get:

(1/3)(x) + (2/3)(tattered jeans) = 6

4.  We know the price of the tattered jeans is $28, so we can substitute 28 for tattered jeans:

(1/3)(x) + (2/3)(28) = 6

5.  Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

(1/3)(x) + 56/3 = 6

6.  Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

x + 56 = 18

7.  Subtract 56 from both sides to solve for x:

x = -38

8.  Since x is the savings from the jogger jeans, the jogger jeans originated at $38. 

9.  The question asks how much more jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans.  The jogger jeans originally cost $38, and the tattered jeans cost $28, so the jogger jeans are $10 more. 

The answer is 10.

 Let's start with Indras' name, which has 6 letters.  Half of the letters in Indras' name is 6 / 2 = 3.  If her sister's name has 4 more letters than 3, then her sister's name has 3 + 4 = 7 letters. 

Total number of letters in both names is 6 + 7 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's first find half of the letters in Indras' name.  Half of 6 is 3.  Since her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name, that's 3 + 4 = 7 letters.  In total, Indras' name has 6 letters and her sister's name has 7 letters.  6 + 7 is 13.  The answer is 13.

[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 132, [output]:  Let's first calculate the original cost of the items:
	* Set of pot and pans: $120. 00
	* Set of mixing bowls: $20. 00
	* 5 separate utensils: 5 x $5. 00 = $25. 00
	Total original cost: $120. 00 + $20. 00 + $25. 00 = $165. 00

Now, since everything is 20% off, we need to calculate the discount:
	* 20% of $165. 00 = 0. 20 x $165. 00 = $33. 00
The discount is $33. 00, so the price after the discount is:
	* $165. 00 - $33. 00 = $132. 00

The answer is 132. 
 First, Charlotte added the cost of the items she wanted: 120 + 20 + 5 * 5 = 120 + 20 + 25 = 165.  The items were 20% off, so we need to calculate 165 * 0. 20 to find the discount.  165 * 0. 20 = 33.  Then, subtract the discount from the original price: 165 - 33 = 132.  The answer is 132. 
 Initially, the utensils cost 5 * 5 = 25 dollars.  The mixing bowls for 20 dollars.  The pot and pans for 120.  So, 25 + 20 + 120 = 165.  It is 20% off.  A discount of 20% is equal to 0. 20 * 165 = 33.  So, the order cost 165 - 33 = 132.  The answer is 132. 
 First, calculate the total cost before discount.  

Charlotte wants a set of pot and pans for 120 dollars, a set of mixing bowls for 20 dollars, and 5 separate utensils at 5 dollars each, so that is 5 * 5 = 25 dollars.  So in total, she wants 120 + 20 + 25 = 165 dollars. 

Next, figure out the discount.  The discount is 20%, so it is 20% of 165 which is 0. 20 * 165 = 33 dollars. 

Now calculate the final cost after discount.  165 - 33 = 132.  The answer is 132 dollars.

1.  Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
2.  Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, which is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons. 
3.  Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, which is 2 * 75 = 150 dragons. 
4.  Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, which is 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons. 

The answer is 30. 
100 dragons were slain by Prince Thaddeus.  Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many as Prince Thaddeus, so 3/4 x 100 = 75 dragons.  Prince Walter slew twice as many as Prince Arthur, so 2 x 75 = 150 dragons.  Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many as Prince Walter, so 1/5 x 150 = 30 dragons.  The answer is 30. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so Prince Arthur slew 100 * 3/4 = 75 dragons. 
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so Prince Walter slew 75 * 2 = 150 dragons. 
Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so Prince Bruce slew 150 * 1/5 = 30 dragons. 

The answer is 30. 
 Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 

Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus:
3/4 * 100 = 75

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur:
2 * 75 = 150

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter:
1/5 * 150 = 30

The answer is 30. 
 Since Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, he slew 100 x 0. 75 = 75 dragons. 

Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 75 x 2 = 150 dragons. 

Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 150 x 0. 2 = 30 dragons. 

The answer is 30. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons. 
Prince Arthur slew 3/4 of what Prince Thaddeus did, so he slew 100 x 3/4 = 75 dragons. 
Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 75 x 2 = 150 dragons. 
Prince Bruce slew 1/5 as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 150 x 1/5 = 30 dragons. 

The answer is 30. 
 First, let's find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew.  Prince Arthur slew 3/4 of what Prince Thaddeus slew.  Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.  So Prince Arthur slew 100 x 3/4 = 75 dragons. 

Now, Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur.  So Prince Walter slew 75 x 2 = 150 dragons. 

Finally, Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter.  Prince Walter slew 150 dragons, so Prince Bruce slew 150 / 5 = 30 dragons. 

The answer is 30.

[EXP] 34: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, so each container has 15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons.  If Josey needed 1/4 of a container, that is 3 ÷ 4 = 0. 75 gallons.  There are 8 pints in a gallon, so Josey needed 0. 75 * 8 = 6 pints.  The answer is 6. 
15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 containers.  Each container gets 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.  Josey needs 1/4 of a container, which is 1/4 * 3 = 3/4 gallons.  Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, she needs 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints of gasoline.  The answer is 6. 
15 gallons of gas were divided into 5 containers, so each container had 15 / 5 = 3 gallons.  Josey needed 1/4 of a container, which is the same as 3 / 4 gallons.  To convert gallons to pints, we can multiply 3 / 4 gallons by 8 (since there are 8 pints in a gallon).  3 / 4 * 8 = 6.  The answer is 6 pints. 
15 gallons of gas were divided into 5 containers, so each container holds 15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons.  1/4 of a container is 3 gallons / 4 = 0. 75 gallons.  Since there are 8 pints in a gallon, Josey needed 0. 75 gallons x 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints. 

The answer is 6. 
15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers.  So each container has 15 ÷ 5 = 3 gallons.  If Josey needed 1/4 of a container, that means she needed 3 x 1/4 = 3/4 gallon.  One gallon has 8 pints.  So 3/4 gallon is 3/4 x 8 = 6 pints.  The answer is 6. 
15 gallons of gas are divided into 5 containers.  Each container will have 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.  Since it takes 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower, it takes 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallon of gas.  There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 3/4 gallon is 6 pints.  The answer is 6.

If George had 1% left, then he had 1% of 500 cents or 5 cents left.  500 - 5 is 495, so he must have spent 495 cents.  He got 3 bags of chips and they cost 40 cents each, so he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.  He spent 495 - 120 = 375 cents on candy bars.  Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, he bought 375 / 75 = 5 candy bars.  The answer is 5. 
 George started with 5 dollars.  Now he has 1% left, which means he has 0. 01 x 5 = 0. 05 dollars left.  So, he spent 5 - 0. 05 = 4. 95 dollars.  Let's subtract the cost of bag of chips from this amount, since he got 3 bags.  3 bags of chips for 40 cents each will be 3 x 0. 40 = 1. 20 dollars.  4. 95 - 1. 20 = 3. 75 dollars.  3. 75 is left for candy bars.  Let's divide 3. 75 by 0. 75, since candy bars cost 75 cents.  3. 75 / 0. 75 = 5.  The answer is 5 Units of Cigar.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock that cost 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.  8 + 4 = 12 dollars.  The soup serves 6 people, so the cost per serving is 12 / 6.  12 / 6 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Antoine starts with 2 pounds of onions, and he wants to double that.  2 * 2 = 4.  So he needs 4 pounds of onions, which will cost 4 x 2. 00 = 8. 00 dollars.  He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock for 2 x 2. 00 = 4. 00 dollars.  In total, the ingredients cost 8. 00 + 4. 00 = 12. 00 dollars.  The recipe serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide 12. 00 by 6.  12. 00 / 6 is 2. 00.  Rounding to the nearest integer, the answer is 2. 
 Antoine's recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions.  He likes to double that, which means 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.  Onions are $2 per pound.  4 pounds will cost 4 x 2 = 8 dollars.  He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which will cost 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.  In total, he will spend 8 + 4 = 12 dollars.  If the soup serves 6 people, the cost per serving is 12 / 6 = 2 dollars per serving.  Rounded to the nearest integer, the answer is 2. 
 Antoine wants to use double the amount of onions, so he needs 4 pounds of onions.  Each pound of onions costs $2, so the total cost of onions is 4 x 2 = $8. 

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock.  Each box costs $2, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 x 2 = $4. 

The total cost is the cost of onions plus the cost of beef stock, which is $8 + $4 = $12. 

This serving size makes 6 soups.  To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $12 / 6 = $2.  

Rounded to the nearest integer, the cost per serving is 2.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  

First, Antoine needs to double the amount of onions needed for the recipe, so the total amount of onions needed is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of onions.  

Next, we need to find the cost of the onions.  4 pounds of onions at 2 dollars a pound will be 4 x 2 = 8 dollars.  

Now, we also need to find the cost of the beef stock.  Antoine needs 2 boxes and each box costs 2 dollars, so the total cost of the beef stock is 2 x 2 = 4 dollars. 

In total, the cost of the soup ingredients is 8 dollars (for onions) + 4 dollars (for beef stock) = 12 dollars.  

Finally, we need to find the cost per serving.  Since the soup serves 6 people, we divide the total cost by 6 to get the cost per serving.  

12 dollars ÷ 6 = 2 dollars per serving

Since it takes Wayne 4 minutes to arrive, Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes before Wayne.  The answer is 17. 
 Wayne will take 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.  It takes Bernadette four times as long, which is 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.  Since Bernadette needs to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 5 + 16 = 21 minutes before he does.  Bernadette should leave 21 - 4 = 17 minutes before Wayne.  The answer is 17. 
 Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater, so the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.  Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 5 minutes before Wayne does.  To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave, subtract the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater from the time it will take Bernadette: 16 (the drive time from Bernadette's apartment) - 4 (the drive time from Wayne's hotel) = 12.  Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, she should leave 12 + 5 = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.  The answer is 17.

[EXP] 41: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 98, [output]: 1 yard is 3 feet, so the length of Billie's room is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.  We know the area is 360 square feet.  To find the width, we divide 360 by the length: 360 ÷ 9 = 40.  So the width is 40 feet.  The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98.  The answer is 98 feet. 
 The area of the room is 360 square feet.  Since the area is length x width, we need to find the width first.  Let's say the width is w.  The length is 3 yards, and 1 yard is 3 feet.  So the length is 3 x 3 = 9 feet.  The area is given as 360 square feet, so we can write an equation: 9 * w = 360.  To find w, we divide both sides by 9: w = 360 / 9 = 40.  The width is 40 feet.  Now that we know the width, we can find the perimeter.  The formula for perimeter is 2 * (length + width).  Plugging in the values, we get: perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.  The answer is 98.

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads (20 pieces) and 2 packs of clear beads (20 x 2 = 40 pieces).  So, Elizabeth has a total of 20 + 40 = 60 beads. 

Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads (20 x 3 = 60 pieces) and 4 packs of red beads (20 x 4 = 80 pieces).  So, Margareth has a total of 60 + 80 = 140 beads. 

To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80. 

The answer is 80. 
 Each pack of beads contains 20 pieces of beads.  Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red and 2 packs of clear beads, so she has a total of 1 + 2 = 3 packs of beads.  With 3 packs of beads, she has a total of 3 x 20 = 60 beads.  Margareth bought 3 packs of blue and 4 packs of red beads, so she has a total of 3 + 4 = 7 packs of beads.  With 7 packs of beads, she has a total of 7 x 20 = 140 beads.  To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract the number of beads Elizabeth has from the number of beads Margareth has: 140 - 60 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
 Let's first calculate the total number of beads each sister has.  Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads, so she has 1 + 2 = 3 packs in total.  Each pack has 20 pieces of beads, so she has 3 x 20 = 60 beads.  Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads, so she has 3 + 4 = 7 packs in total.  She also has 7 x 20 = 140 beads. 

Now, let's compare the number of beads the sisters have.  Margareth has 140 beads and Elizabeth has 60 beads.  To find out how many more beads Margareth has than Elizabeth, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads: 140 - 60 = 80.  Therefore, Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

[EXP] 44: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 59, [output]:  Let's start by finding the times for each part of the triathlon for James. 

Swim:  Jon took 40 minutes, and James took 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes. 

Bike: Jon took 1 hour and 20 minutes, which is 80 minutes.  James took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes. 

Then, we can find the time it took James to finish the triathlon: 
36 + 85 + (run time) = total time

We know Jon finished 10 minutes earlier.  So, Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170, and James' total time is 170 + 10 = 180.  If 180 is James' total time, we can subtract 180 from it to find James' run time. 
180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = 59.  The answer is 59 minutes. 
 Let's first break down Jon's total time into components.   Jon takes 40 minutes for the swim, 80 minutes for the bike ride, and 50 minutes for the run.   So in total, he takes 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes, or 2 hours and 50 minutes. 

James finishes the swim 10% faster, which means he took 40 - 4 = 36 minutes.   For the bike ride, he takes 5 minutes longer, so 85 minutes.   Now we need to find the total time James took. 
James took 36 + 85 + unknown time on the run.   We are told that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James took 10 minutes more than Jon.   So total time for James in minutes is 170 + 10 = 180.   180 - 36 - 85 = 59. 

The answer is 59. 
 Let's break down the times for Jon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James is 10% faster in the swim, which means he took 40 * (1 - 0. 1) = 36 minutes.  He took 5 minutes longer on the bike, so that is 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.  Now we know James' time for the swim and bike, his total time will be:
36 + 85 = 121 minutes

Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time must be 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.  The only thing we don't know is how long the run took for James.  We know this:
- James' total time is 180 minutes. 
- He took 36 minutes for the swim and 85 minutes for the bike. 

We can calculate his total time excluding the run:
36 + 85 = 121
180 - 121 = 59

This means it took James 59 minutes for the run.  The answer is 59.

[EXP] 45: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 1. 25 hours is 1. 25 x 60 = 75 minutes.  Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so it was 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long.  Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so it was 80 / 4 = 20 minutes long.  The answer is 20. 
 Movie C was 1. 25 hours.  1. 25 hours is 1. 25 * 60 = 75 minutes.  Movie B was 5 minutes longer, so Movie B was 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.  Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A was 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's break it down step by step:

1.  Movie C was 1. 25 hours, which is equal to 1. 25 x 60 = 75 minutes. 
2.  Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes long. 
3.  Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is (1/4) x 80 = 20 minutes long. 

The answer is 20. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Movie C is 1. 25 hours.  Convert this to minutes: 1. 25 x 60 = 75 minutes. 

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes. 

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, so Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes. 

The answer is 20. 
1. 25 hours is equal to 75 minutes (1 hour is 60 minutes and there are 0. 25 hours left). 

Movie C is 1. 25 hours (or 75 minutes).  Movie B was 5 minutes longer, so Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes. 

Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B.  If Movie B is 80 minutes, then Movie A is 1/4 of 80.  To divide by a fraction, multiply by the reciprocal: 80 * 1/4 = 80 * 0. 25 = 20. 

The answer is 20.

[EXP] 46: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many miles the horse ran.  The question states that the horse ran for 30 minutes at 32MPH, so we can calculate the distance:

30 minutes = 0. 5 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)
0. 5 hours * 32MPH = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay per mile, the horse ate 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.  Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of hay is 8 * 3 = 24 dollars. 

Michael has 6 5-dollar bills, which is a total of 6 * 5 = 30 dollars.  After buying the hay, he will have 30 - 24 dollars left.  30 - 24 is 6.  The answer is 6. 
 Michael's horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH.  To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60.  30 / 60 = 0. 5 hours.  Since he runs for 0. 5 hours, his horse runs 0. 5 x 32 = 16 miles.  

For each mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay.  For 16 miles, the horse eats 16 / 2 = 8 bails of hay.  Each bail costs $3, so a total of 8 x 3 = 24 dollars is spent on hay. 

Michael has 6 x 5 dollar bills, which is 30 dollars in total.  After spending 24 dollars on hay, he will have 30 - 24 = 6 dollars left.  The answer is 6. 
 Let's figure out how many miles the horse ran first.  Since the horse ran for 30 minutes and is 32MPH, we can calculate the distance as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time = 32MPH x 0. 5 hours (30 minutes) = 16 miles

Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, the total number of bail's of hay consumed is:

Total Hay = Distance x Hay Per Mile = 16 miles x 1/2 = 8 bails

Since each bail costs $3, the total cost of hay is:

Total Cost = Total Hay x Cost Per Hay = 8 bails x $3 = $24

Michael has 6 $5 bills, which is a total of:

Michael's Initial Cash = 6 x $5 = $30

After buying the hay, he has:

Michael's Remaining Cash = Michael's Initial Cash - Total Cost = $30 - $24 = $6

The answer is 6.

[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 1 dozen eggs is 12 eggs.  Rozanne used 4 dozen eggs so that's 12 x 4 = 48 eggs.  She also used 2 loose eggs, so in total she used 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.  Each glass needs 5 eggs, so Rozanne can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses.  Since each tray holds 5 glasses, she can put out 10 / 5 = 2 trays.  The answer is 2. 
4 dozen eggs means 4 x 12 = 48 eggs.  We add the remaining 2 eggs, making a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.  Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so Rozanne can make 50 / 5 = 10 glasses of eggnog.  Each tray holds 5 glasses, so Rozanne can put out 10 / 5 = 2 trays.  The answer is 2. 
 Rozanne used 4 dozen eggs.  1 dozen eggs is 12, so 4 dozen eggs is 12 * 4 = 48.  Then she used 2 more eggs, so in total she used 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.  She can fill trays with 5 glasses, and each glass needs 5 eggs.  So one tray needs 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.  If Rozanne used 50 eggs, she can fill 50 / 25 = 2 trays.  The answer is 2. 
 Rosanne started with 4 dozen eggs.  Each dozen has 12 eggs, so 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.  Then she added 2 more eggs, making a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.  Each tray needs 5 eggs per glass, so to make 1 tray, she needs 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.  How many sets of 25 eggs does she have? 50 ÷ 25 = 2.  The answer is 2.

The rest, 48 - 17 = 31, were sold to the department store for $25 each.  So, 31 x 25 = 775 dollars.  In total, he made 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars from selling the sneakers.  To find the profit, subtract the cost from the selling price, 1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
 The salesman sold 17 sneakers for 20 dollars each.  17 * 20 = 340.   He sold the rest to the department store.   There were 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.   31 * 25 = 775 dollars.   In total, he made 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.   He bought 48 sneakers for 576 dollars.   So his profit is 1115 - 576 = 539.  The answer is 539. 
48 sneakers were originally bought for 576 dollars.  After selling 17 sneakers for $20 each, the salesman got 17 x 20 = 340 dollars.  The rest of the 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers are left.  They are sold for $25 each, so the salesman gets 25 x 31 = 775 dollars from the department store.  Total revenue is 340 + 775 = 1115.  The cost was 576, so the profit is 1115 - 576 = 539.

[EXP] 51: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4, [output]:  You want to find the price of popcorn. 

Consider this: You didn't buy the super ticket, so you spent $12 on the movie ticket and $3 on the soda.  You spent a total of $12 + $3 = $15. 

Since you saved $2, that means you would have spent $15 + $2 = $17 if you didn't have this option.  But you did, and it was the better option.  That means the regular price of popcorn must have been $17 - $12 = $5.  The answer is 5. 
 Let's break this down step by step.  

Let's say the regular price of popcorn is p. 

If you buy a regular movie ticket and popcorn and a soda, it will cost 12 + p + 3. 

But you bought the super ticket and saved 2 dollars.  So the cost of the super ticket must be 20 - 2 = 18. 

This includes a popcorn and a soda for 1 dollar extra.  So the cost of the super ticket without the popcorn and soda is 18 - 1 = 17 dollars. 

The regular ticket is for 12 dollars.  So the cost of a regular ticket without popcorn and soda is 12. 

The difference between the cost of a super ticket without popcorn and soda and a regular ticket without popcorn and soda is 17 - 12 = 5 dollars.  This 5-dollar difference must be equal to the cost of the popcorn.  

So, p = 5.  The answer is 5.

Then it drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so it travels another 30 miles.  The total distance is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.  The total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.  To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's break down the trip: the car drives 60 mph for 2 hours, which is a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.  Then it drives 30 mph for 1 hour, which is a distance of 30 * 1 = 30 miles.  In total, it travels 120 + 30 = 150 miles in 2 + 1 = 3 hours.  To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.  The answer is 50. 
 First, let's find out the total distance the car traveled.  The car travels at 60 mph for 2 hours, so it travels a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles.  Then it travels at 30 mph for 1 hour, so it travels another distance of 30 miles.  The total distance is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.  The total time it takes the car to travel is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.  To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time: 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's first calculate the distance the car traveled at 60 mph for 2 hours.  60 mph x 2 hours = 120 miles.   Then, the car traveled at 30 mph for 1 hour, so it went another 30 miles.   In total, the car traveled 120 + 30 = 150 miles.   

The total time traveled is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.   To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time.  150 miles divided by 3 hours is 50 mph.   The answer is 50. 
 The car traveled for 2 hours at 60 mph.  That is 2 * 60 = 120 miles in the first part of the journey.  Then it traveled for 1 hour at 30 mph.  That is 1 * 30 = 30 miles.  In total it traveled 120 + 30 = 150 miles in 2 + 1 = 3 hours.  To find the average speed, we divide total distance by the time taken: 150 / 3 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's first calculate the distance the car traveled during the first 2 hours.  If it drove 60 mph for 2 hours, then the distance traveled is 60 x 2 = 120 miles.  The car then drove for an additional 1 hour at 30 mph.  So it drove an additional 30 miles.  The total distance traveled is 120 + 30 = 150 miles.  The total duration of the trip was 2 + 1 = 3 hours.  To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total duration: 150 / 3 = 50.  The answer is 50 mph.

 Each raised bed is 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, so it takes up 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet of soil.  There are 10 beds, so in total it will take 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet of soil.  Each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = 160 bags of potting soil.  Each bag costs $12, so in total the potting soil will cost 160 x 12 = 1920.  The answer is 1920. 
 We need to first calculate the total volume of soil needed.  The dimensions of each raised bed are 2 feet wide, 8 feet long, and 2 feet tall, so the volume of each bed is 2 x 8 x 2 = 32 cubic feet.  For 10 raised beds, the total volume is 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet. 

Since each bag holds 2 cubic feet of soil, we can divide the total volume by 2 to find the number of bags needed: 320 / 2 = 160 bags. 

Since each bag costs $12, the total cost is 160 x 12 = 1920.  The answer is 1920.

60% more green cards than red cards means that the number of green cards is 15 + (0. 60 * 15) = 15 + 9 = 24 cards.  The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards, so it's 15 + 24 = 39.  In total, there are 39 + 24 + 15 = 78 cards.  The answer is 78. 
15 red cards.  Since there are 60% more green cards, we need to find 60% of 15.  60% = 60/100 = 0. 6.  0. 6 * 15 = 9.  There are 15 red cards and 9 more green cards, so 15 + 9 = 24 green cards.  Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards.  So 15 + 24 = 39 yellow cards.  In total, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.  The answer is 78. 
15 is the number of red cards.  Since there are 60% more green cards, we need to find 15 * 1. 6 = 24.  This is the number of green cards.  We add the number of red cards and green cards to get the sum.  15 + 24 = 39.  The number of yellow cards is the sum of red and green, which is 39.  To find the total, we add the number of cards of all three colors.  15 + 24 + 39 = 78.  The answer is 78. 
 Let's start by finding the number of green cards.  There are 15 red cards and 60% more green cards.  To find the number of green cards, multiply the number of red cards by 1. 6 (since 100% + 60% is 160%, or 1. 6). 

15 x 1. 6 = 24

So, there are 24 green cards.  According to the problem, yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards.  In other words, the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of 15 (red) and 24 (green) cards. 

15 + 24 = 39

Now, we add the number of cards of each color to find the total number of cards. 

Red cards: 15
Green cards: 24
Yellow cards: 39
Total: 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

The answer is 78.

[EXP] 58: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 50 fairies were originally flying above the forest.  After 20 minutes, another 50/2 = 25 fairies joined them, so there were 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  Then 30 fairies flew away, so there are 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining.  The answer is 45. 
50 fairies were seen initially.  Then, half of 50, which is 25, joined.  So, in total, there are 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  Then, 30 fairies flew away.  75 - 30 is 45.  The answer is 45. 
 Katelyn saw 50 fairies originally.  After 20 minutes, one of her friends saw 50 / 2 = 25 fairies come to join the original 50.  So there were 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  After 10 minutes, 30 fairies flew away.  So the remaining fairies are 75 - 30 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
50 fairies were originally flying above the forest.  Then one of her friends saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which means 50 / 2 = 25 more fairies joined.  So in total, there were 50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
50 fairies were originally seen by Katelyn.  One of her friends saw half as many - 1/2 of 50 is 25.  So 25 more fairies joined the original 50, making a total of 50 + 25 = 75.  10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.  So 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remain.  The answer is 45. 
50 fairies were initially seen.  Then, another half of that number came from the east and joined them.  So that's 50 / 2 = 25 more fairies.  50 + 25 = 75 fairies.  After 30 fairies flew away, there are 75 - 30 = 45 remaining fairies.  The answer is 45. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step:

1.  Katelyn sees 50 fairies initially. 
2.  Her friend sees half as many fairies (50/2 = 25) from the east and joins them with the original 50 fairies, so now there are 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. 
3.  30 fairies fly away, leaving the remaining fairies: 75 - 30 = 45. 

The answer is 45. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Katelyn originally saw 50 fairies. 

Then her friend saw half as many, which is 50/2 = 25, flying from the east and join the rest.  So now there are 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. 

Ten minutes later, 30 fairies flew away, leaving 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining.

[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]: 8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.  3 + 4 = 7 puppies have spots.  To find the percentage, divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100.  7 / 20 = 0. 35.  0. 35 * 100 = 35.  The answer is 35%. 
8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.  3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.  So the percentage of puppies with spots is 7/20.  To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100, so it becomes 7 * 100 / 20 = 35%.  The answer is 35%. 
8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.  
Out of them, there are 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.

[EXP] 60: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the total weight of all the items:
- Hay: 42 bales x 75 pounds per bale = 3150 pounds
- Oats: 20 sacks x 65 pounds per sack = 1300 pounds
- Carrots: 4 bags x 12 pounds per bag = 48 pounds
- Sugar cubes: 2 boxes x 1 pound per box = 2 pounds

Total weight = 3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 3500 pounds

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.  To find out how many trips the farmer needs to make, we can divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

3500 pounds ÷ 2250 pounds per trip = 1. 55 trips

Since you can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer needs to make 2 trips (the next whole number up).  The answer is 2. 
 To find the total weight of the different items, we first add up their weights:

Number of sugar cubes (2 boxes x 1 pound) = 2 pounds
Number of carrots (4 bags x 12 pounds) = 48 pounds
Number of hay bales (42 bales x 75 pounds) = 3150 pounds
Number of oats sacks (20 sacks x 65 pounds) = 1300 pounds

Total weight = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3500 pounds

The farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time.  To find the number of trips needed, we'll divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

3500 pounds / 2250 pounds per trip = 1. 5555 (round up to 2)

The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.  The answer is 2. 
 The farmer's haul is 2 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes (2 pounds), 4 12-pound bags of carrots (4 x 12 = 48 pounds), 42 75-pound bales of hay (42 x 75 = 3150 pounds), and 20 65-pound sacks of oats (20 x 65 = 1300 pounds).  So in total, the farmer has 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3500 pounds of feed to transport.  Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to calculate how many times we can fit 2250 pounds in the truck: 3500 / 2250 = 1. 55.  Since we cannot fractionally fill a truck, we round up and detect that we need at least 2 trips.  The answer is 2.

[EXP] 61: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 84, [output]:  Grayson earns 2 cents for each aluminum can and 3 cents for each plastic bottle.  She drinks 3 cans and 5 bottles a week.  So she earns (2 x 3) + (3 x 5) = 6 + 15 = 21 cents per week.  For a four-week month, she earns 4 x 21 = 84 cents.  The answer is 84. 
3 aluminum cans are worth 3 x 2 cents = 6 cents each week.  5 plastic bottles are worth 5 x 3 cents = 15 cents each week.  In 4 weeks, Grayson earns 6 cents * 4 = 24 cents from aluminum cans and 15 cents * 4 = 60 cents from plastic bottles.  So she earns 24 + 60 = 84 cents from recycling a month.  The answer is 84. 
 First, let's calculate the earnings from recycling cans.  Each can is worth 2 cents, and Grayson drinks 3 cans a week.  3 cans x 2 cents per can = 6 cents per week.  For a four-week month, that's 6 cents x 4 = 24 cents. 

Next, let's calculate the earnings from recycling plastic bottles.  Each bottle is worth 3 cents, and Grayson drinks 5 bottles a week.  5 bottles x 3 cents per bottle = 15 cents per week.  For a four-week month, that's 15 cents x 4 = 60 cents. 

To find out how much Grayson earns in total, add her earnings from recycling cans and bottles: 24 cents + 60 cents = 84 cents. 

The answer is 84. 
1.  First, calculate how many cans and bottles Grayson drinks each week: 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles. 

2.  Calculate the total number of weeks in a month: 4 weeks

3.  Calculate the total number of cans and bottles Grayson drinks in a month: 3 cans * 4 weeks = 12 cans; 5 bottles * 4 weeks = 20 bottles

4.  Calculate the total amount of money Grayson earns per week from cans: 3 cans * 2 cents = 6 cents
And from bottles: 5 bottles * 3 cents = 15 cents
So Grayson earns 6 cents + 15 cents = 21 cents per week from recycling

5.  Calculate the total amount of money Grayson earns in a month: 21 cents * 4 weeks = 84 cents

The answer is 84 cents. 
 Grayson drinks 3 aluminum cans and 5 plastic bottles each week.  In a 4-week month, it would be 4 * (3 + 5) = 4 * 8 = 32 cans and bottles.  An aluminum can and plastic bottle are worth 2 cents and 3 cents respectively.  Total, it would be 2 * 3 + 3 * 5 = 6 + 15 = 21 cents per day.  For a 4-week month, that would be 21 * 4 = 84.  The answer is 84. 
 Grayson drinks three aluminum cans per week.  Since there are four weeks in a month, she drinks three x 4 = 12 aluminum cans of soda.  Those 12 cans are worth 2 cents each, so she earns 12 x 2 = 24 cents from aluminum cans. 

She also drinks 5 plastic bottles of water a week.  And since there are four weeks in a month, she drinks 5 x 4 = 20 plastic bottles.  Those 20 bottles are worth 3 cents each, so she earns 20 x 3 = 60 cents from plastic bottles. 

In total, Grayson earns 24 cents from aluminum cans and 60 cents from plastic bottles.  That is 24 + 60 = 84 cents.  The answer is 84.

 Fred has 10 plants.  Toni has 10 + (10 x 0. 60) = 16 plants.  Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.  The answer is 9. 
 Since Frederick has 10 plants, Toni has 10 + 60% of 10 plants.  To find 60% of 10, multiply by 0. 6: 10 x 0. 6 = 6.  So Toni has 16 plants (10 + 6).  Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so she has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.  The answer is 9. 
 Let's start by finding the number of plants that Toni has.  Since Frederick has 10 plants and Toni has 60% more, Toni has 60% of 10 which is 0. 6 x 10 = 6.  So Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants. 

Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.  The answer is 9. 
 Frederick has 10 plants.  Toni has 60% more.  60% of 10 is 0. 6 x 10 = 6.  So Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants.  Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.  So Shondra has 16 - 7 = 9 plants.  The answer is 9 Plants. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Frederick has 10 plants. 
Toni has 60% more plants than Frederick.  To find out how many plants Toni has, we calculate 10 + (60% of 10). 

60% of 10 is 0. 6 * 10 = 6. 
Toni has 10 + 6 = 16 plants. 

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni.  To find out how many plants Shondra has, we subtract 7 from Toni's total. 

16 - 7 = 9. 

The answer is 9. 
 Let's start by using the information that Frederick has 10 plants.  Then we know that Toni has 60% more, which is equal to 1. 6 times 10, or 16 plants. 

Since Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, we can subtract 7 from 16 to get the number of plants Shondra has.  16 - 7 = 9. 

The answer is 9 plants. 
 Let's first find out how many plants Toni has.  Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more.  To find the increase, multiply 10 by 0. 6 (which is the same as 60% as a decimal) to get 6.  Add this to Frederick's 10 to get 16 plants.  Toni has 16 plants. 

Shondra has 7 fewer plants than Toni, so subtract 7 from Toni's 16: 16 - 7 = 9.  Shondra has 9 plants.  The answer is 9.

 Ali started with 21 dollars.  Leila gave him half of her 100 dollars, which is 100 / 2 = 50 dollars.  So Ali now has 21 + 50 = 71 dollars.  The answer is 71. 
 Ali started with 21 dollars.  Leila gave him half of her 100 dollars.  Half of 100 is 50.  21 + 50 = 71.  The answer is 71. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  Ali had $21 initially.  Leila gave him half of her $100.  To find half of $100, we can multiply 100 by 0. 5 (which is the same as dividing by 2):

$100 × 0. 5 = $50

So Leila gave Ali $50.  To find out how much Ali has now, we add the $21 he already had to the $50 he received:

After a discount of $1, the cost will be $8.  20 apples for 50 cents each will be 50 x 20 = 1000 cents or $10.  With a 10 percent discount, the cost will be $9.  The difference between $10 and $9 is $1.  The answer is 1. 
20 apples for 45 cents each is $0. 45 x 20 = $9.  Since Becky received a $1 discount, she actually paid $9 - $1 = $8. 

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, which is $0. 50 x 20 = $10.  She received a 10% discount, which is $1.  So she actually paid $10 - $1 = $9. 

Kelly paid $9 and Becky paid $8.  To find the difference, subtract $8 from $9, which is $1.  The answer is 1. 
20 apples for 45 cents each will be 20 x 0. 45 = 9 dollars, minus 1 dollar discount, so Becky paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars.  

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each.  20 x 0. 50 = 10 dollars, and for a 10% discount, 10 * 0. 1 = 1 dollar off, so Kelly paid 10 - 1 = 9 dollars. 

Kelly paid 9 dollars and Becky paid 8 dollars.  The difference is 9 - 8 = 1.  The answer is 1 dollar. 
20 apples at 45 cents each is 45 cents * 20 = 900 cents, which is $9.  After a $1 discount, Becky paid $8. 

20 apples at 50 cents each is 50 cents * 20 = 1000 cents, which is $10.  After a 10% discount, we calculate a discount of 10% of $10, which is $1.  So Kelly paid 10 - 1 = $9. 

To find the difference, subtract Becky's price from Kelly's price: $9 - $8 = $1.  The answer is 1 dollar. 
1st, I need to calculate the cost of the apples for Becky and Kelly.  Becky bought the apples for 45 cents each, so the total cost is 20 apples * 0. 45 = 9 dollars.  However, she received a 1-dollar discount, so her actual cost is 9 - 1 = 8 dollars. 

Kelly bought the apples for 50 cents each, so the total cost is 20 apples * 0. 5 = 10 dollars.  Kelly received a 10% discount, which is 10% of 10 = 1 dollar discount.  So, Kelly's actual cost is 10 - 1 = 9 dollars. 

To find how much more Kelly paid than Becky, I need to subtract Becky's cost from Kelly's cost: 9 - 8 = 1.  The answer is 1 dollar. 
20 apples at 45 cents each for Becky will be 45 x 20 = 900 cents.  900 cents is equal to 9 dollars.  With a 1 dollar discount, Becky paid 9 - 1 = 8 dollars. 

Kelly bought the same 20 apples, but at 50 cents each.  That is 50 x 20 = 1000 cents, or 10 dollars.  With a 10% discount, the discount is 10% of 10 dollars, which is 10 x 0. 10 = 1 dollar.  Kelly pays 10 - 1 = 9 dollars. 
So Kelly paid 9 dollars, while Becky paid 8.  To find out how much more Kelly paid, subtract Becky's cost from Kelly's: 9 - 8 = 1.  The answer is 1 dollar.

[EXP] 73: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.  He's told that he can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.  Let's say the number of carrot sticks he eats is x. 

So, the total number of cookies he'll get is x/2 + 2. 

Matt wants to eat 5 cookies, so we set up the equation:

x/2 + 2 = 5

We can solve for x by subtracting 2 from both sides:

x/2 = 5 - 2
x/2 = 3

Next, we multiply both sides by 2 to get:

x = 3 × 2
x = 6

So, Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.  The answer is 6. 
 Matt wants to eat 5 cookies.  In total, he can have half as many cookies as carrot sticks, plus 2 extra.  Let's call the number of carrot sticks x.  So, the number of cookies he gets is (1/2) x + 2.  

Since he wants to eat 5 cookies in total, we can set up the equation: (1/2) x + 2 = 5 

Subtract 2 from both sides: (1/2) x = 3 

Multiply both sides by 2: x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 74: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 6 inches is equivalent to 0. 5 feet.  The combined length of the remoras is 2 x 0. 5 = 1 foot.  The shark has a length of 10 feet.  So, the percentage of the shark's body length taken up by the remoras is 1 / 10 = 0. 1 = 10%.  The answer is 10. 
6 inches is 0. 5 feet since 12 inches is equal to 1 foot.  The combined length of the remoras is 0. 5 x 2 = 1 foot.  The total length of the shark and the remoras is 10 + 1 = 11 feet.  The percentage is (1 / 10) x 100 = 10.  The answer is 10 percent. 
1.  Convert the remoras' lengths to feet: 2 * 6 inches = 12 inches, then 12 inches / 12 inches per foot = 1 foot. 

2.  The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot. 
3.  The total length of the shark is 10 feet. 
4.  To find the percentage, do: (1 foot / 10 feet) x 100 = 10%.  

The answer is 10%. 
 Let's convert the length of the remoras from inches to feet.  6 inches is 0. 5 feet.  There are 2 remoras, so their combined length is 0. 5 x 2 = 1 foot.  The combined length of the remoras is 1 foot.  To find the percentage of the shark's body length that the combined length of the remoras is, we find the ratio of the remoras' length to the shark's length: (1/10) x 100% = 10%.  The answer is 10%. 
1.  Convert the lengths to the same unit: 
6 inches is 0. 5 feet.  
The combined length of the remoras is 6 inches + 6 inches = 12 inches = 1 foot.  
So the remoras take up 1 foot out of the 10-foot shark.  
2.  Convert this to a percentage: (1 / 10) x 100% = 10%.  
The answer is 10%.

[EXP] 75: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]: 3/4 of the students have desktop computers.  The remaining 1/4 do not have desktop computers.  Since 20 students do not have desktop computers, that means 1/4 of the students is 20.  To find the total number of students, multiply 20 by 4, which is 80. 

Since 1/4 of the students is 20, then 3/4 of the students is 3 x 20 = 60.  So in total there are 20 students who do not have desktop computers and 60 students who do have desktop computers.  The total number of students is 20 + 60 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
20 students do not have desktop computers.  That means that 3/4 of the students have desktop computers.  To get the total number of students, we can find a way to add 20 back to the number of students who have desktop computers.  Because 3/4 have desktop computers, we can say that 4/4 is the total number of students.  So, if 4/4 is the total number of students, then 1/4 will be the number of students who don't have desktop computers.  

Since 20 students is 1/4 of the total, the total number of students will be 4 times 20, since 1/4 is 20.  4 x 20 = 80.  The answer is 80.

32 kids in class.  9 kids are allergic to dairy, 6 are allergic to peanuts, and 3 are allergic to both.  We need to subtract those allergies.  There are 9 + 6 - 3 = 12 kids with some allergy.  So there are 32 - 12 = 20 kids who aren't allergic to anything.  The answer is 20. 
9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 kids are allergic to peanuts.  9 + 6 is 15.  These 15 are allergic to either dairy or peanuts, or both.  But 3 are allergic to both, so that means 15 - 3 = 12 kids are allergic to either one or the other of these allergens.  The remaining kids would not be allergic to anything.  There are 32 kids in total.  So 32 - 12 = 20 kids are not allergic to anything.  The answer is 20. 
32 kids are in the class, and 9 are allergic to dairy.  So there are 32 - 9 = 23 kids not allergic to dairy.  We know that 3 kids are allergic to both dairy and peanuts, so they are not in this group of 23 kids.  Adding 3 back to 23 gives us 26 kids not allergic to dairy or peanuts.  But we know that 6 kids are allergic to peanuts, and they are counted in the group of 26.  So we subtract 6 from 26 to get 20.  The answer is 20. 
32 kids total, 
9 are allergic to dairy,
6 are allergic to peanuts
3 are allergic to both (they are said to be allergic to dairy and peanuts, not to both separately, so we don't double-count them)
Add the 9 and 6: 9 + 6 = 15
15 kids are allergic to something, but not all are allergic to both, so those 3 who are allergic to both will be double-counted when we add 9 + 6.  So we need to subtract the 3 that are allergic to both to avoid double-counting: 15 - 3 = 12

So the 2010 penny weighs 3/4 * 48 = 36 grains.  The combined weight of the two pennies is 48 + 36 = 84 grains.  The answer is 84. 
 Since the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny, we know the 2010 penny weighs 0. 75 x 48 = 36 grains.  To find the combined weight of the two pennies, we add 36 + 48 = 84.  The answer is 84. 
 Belen has 2 pennies.  The 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.  If the 2010 penny is 3/4 the weight of the 1959 penny, that means it weighs 48 * (3/4) = 36 grains.  So the total weight is 36 + 48 = 84 grains.  The answer is 84. 
1st, find the weight of the 2010 penny.  If it's 3/4 the weight of the 1959 penny, then it weighs 3/4 * 48 = 36 grains.  The total weight is 36 + 48 = 84.  The answer is 84. 
1959 penny weighs 48 grains.  2010 penny is three-quarters of that weight, so it weighs 48 * 3/4 = 36 grains.  We need to find the combined weight.  The total weight of the pennies is 48 + 36 = 84.  The answer is 84. 
 We need to find the weight of the 2010 penny first.  Since the 2010 penny is 3/4 the weight of the 1959 penny, we need to find 3/4 of 48.  To do this, we multiply 48 by 3 and divide by 4. 

48 * 3 = 144
144 ÷ 4 = 36

So the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains. 

To find the combined weight, we add the weights of the two pennies. 
48 (1959 penny) + 36 (2010 penny) = 84

The answer is 84. 
2010 penny's weight is 3/4th of 1959 penny's weight.  So, 2010 penny's weight = (3/4) * 48 = 36 grains.  

There are two kinds of pennies: 1959 and 2010.  1959 penny's weight is 48 grains and 2010 penny's weight is 36 grains.  

To find the combined weight, we add the two: 48 + 36 = 84.  The answer is 84.

[EXP] 83: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Keegan and Tashay had 83 + 91 = 174 dollars by 3 pm.  They need 200 dollars.  So they need to earn 200 - 174 dollars.  200 - 174 is 26.  The answer is 26. 
 Keegan earned $83 and Tasha earned $91, so in total they have earned $83 + $91 = $174.  To reach their goal of $200, they still need to earn $200 - $174 = $26.  The answer is 26. 
 Keegan and Tashay need to earn 200 dollars in total.  Keegan has 83 dollars and Tashay has 91 dollars.  So in total they have 83 + 91 = 174 dollars.  However, they need 200 dollars.  So they need 200 - 174 = 26 more dollars.  The answer is 26. 
 Keegan had $83 and Tashay had $91.  That means together they had $83 + $91 = $174.  They need $200 total.  To find out how much more they need, we subtract 174 from 200, which is 200 - 174 = 26.  The answer is 26.

 Stetson ate 2/5 of the oranges.  2/5 of 60 is 2/5 * 60 = 24 oranges.  For each orange, Stetson gives up 10 dollars.  So he gave up 24 * 10 = 240 dollars.  The answer is 240. 
 Stetson ate 2/5 of the 60 oranges.  2/5 of 60 is 24.  So he ate 24 oranges.  Stetson made a bet with Alec that he would give up $10 for each orange he eats.  So he gave up 24 x 10 = 240.  The answer is 240. 
 Stetson started with 60 oranges.  He ate 2/5 * 60 = 24 oranges.  From the bet, he gave up 24 * 10 = 240 dollars.  The answer is 240. 
 Stetson ate 2/5 of 60 oranges, which is (2/5) x 60 = 24.  Stetson will give 10 dollars for each orange, so he will give 10 x 24 dollars.  10 x 24 is 240.  The answer is 240. 
 Stetson started with no money.  For each orange he eats, he gives up 10 dollars.  2/5 of the oranges they picked were 60 * 2/5 = 24 oranges.  For each of these 24 oranges, he gave up 10 dollars.  24 x 10 = 240 dollars.  The answer is 240. 
2/5 of 60 oranges is the same as 60 x (2/5) = 60 x 0. 4 = 24.  Stetson gave up 24 oranges.  If he gives $10 for each orange, then he gave up 10 x 24 = 240.  The answer is 240.

[EXP] 87: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  James runs 12 miles a day.  He runs for 5 days a week.  So in total he runs 12 * 5 = 60 miles a week. 

Since he runs 10 miles an hour, he runs for 60 / 10 = 6 hours a week. 

The answer is 6. 
 James runs 12 miles per day, 5 days a week.  12 * 5 = 60 miles per week.  If he runs at a pace of 10 miles per hour, the number of hours he runs a week is 60 / 10 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days.  So, the total distance he runs in a week is 5 x 12 = 60 miles.  At 10 miles per hour, it will take him 60 / 10 = 6 hours to run those 60 miles.  The answer is 6. 
 First, you need to calculate how many miles James runs in a week.  He runs 12 miles a day, and there are 5 days in a week, so:
12 miles/day x 5 days = 60 miles/week

Since James runs 10 miles per hour, you can set up the equation:
miles/week = miles/hour x hours
60 miles/week = 10 miles/hour x hours
To solve for hours, divide both sides of the equation by 10 miles/hour:
hours = 60 miles/week / 10 miles/hour
hours = 6 hours/week
The answer is 6.

[EXP] 88: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Uncle Ben has 4 horses.  Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal, and each meal is twice a day.  So the total oats consumed by each horse in a day is 5 x 2 = 10 pounds.  For 4 horses, the total oats consumed in a day is 10 x 4 = 40 pounds.  For 5 days, the total oats consumed is 5 x 40 = 200 pounds.  There are 50 pounds in each bag, so the total number of bags needed is 200 / 50 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
 Uncle Ben has 4 horses.  Each horse needs 5 pounds of oats per meal.  He feeds them twice a day.  So each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.  For 4 horses, that's 4 * 10 = 40 pounds of oats.  Over 5 days, Uncle Ben's horses will eat 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.  One bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.  The answer is 4. 
 Uncle Ben has 4 horses.  Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal.  He feeds them 2 times a day, so each horse eats 5 * 2 = 10 pounds a day.  All 4 horses will eat 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.  In total, for 5 days, 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats are needed.  Since one bag contains 50 pounds, the number of bags of oats needed is 200 / 50 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
 Uncle Ben has 4 horses.  Each horse eats 5 pounds twice a day, which means each horse eats 5 x 2 = 10 pounds per day.  Since there are 4 horses, Uncle Ben needs 4 * 10 = 40 pounds of oats per day.  He needs to feed his horses for 5 days, so he needs 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.  The problem statement mentions that one bag contains 50-pounds of oats, so Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.  The answer is 4.

27 puppies are the total.  Two thirds of them are Pomeranians.  So, two thirds of 27 is 2/3 * 27 = 18 Pomeranians.  One third of the Pomeranians are girls.  So, one third of 18 Pomeranians are girls.  That's 1/3 * 18 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.  So that means there are 2/3 x 27 = 18 Pomeranians.  Then, 1/3 of them are girls.  That means 1/3 x 18 = 6 are girl Pomeranians.  The answer is 6. 
2/3 of Jana's 27 puppies are Pomeranians.  1/3 of those are girls.  To find the number of Pomeranians, we multiply 2/3 with 27: (2/3) * 27 = 18.  Then to find the number of girl Pomeranians, we multiply 1/3 with 18: (1/3) * 18 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
27 puppies started with Jana.  Two-thirds of 27 is 18, since 2 * 9 = 18.  So 18 of her puppies are Pomeranians.  One-third of those are girls.  One-third of 18 is 6, since 1 * 6 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
27 is the total number of puppies.  Two thirds of them are Pomeranians.  To find that, we multiply 27 by 2/3 = 18.  18 are Pomeranians, and 1/3 of them are girls.  1/3 of 18 is 6.  The answer is 6. 
27 puppies = total number of puppies.

 First, add up the temperatures for all 3 countries.  -48 + 21 - 3 = -30.  Then divide by 3.  -30 / 3 = -10.  The answer is -10. 
1st, we find the sum of the highest temperatures:

-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Next, we divide this sum by 3 to get the average:

-30 ÷ 3 = -10

The answer is -10. 
1st step: find sum of temperatures. 
-48 + 21 - 3 = -30
2nd step: divide by number of temperatures. 
-30 / 3 = -10
The answer is -10. 
 We add the three highest temperatures recorded in the three countries and divide by 3:

(-48 + 21 + (-3)) / 3 = (-30) / 3 = -10

So the average highest temperature is -10 degrees Fahrenheit.  The answer is -10. 
 We need to add together the highest temperatures of these 3 countries and then divide by 3. 

Let's add them together:

-48 + 21 + (-3) = -30

Now, let's divide the total by 3:

-30 / 3 = -10

So, the average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit. 
1.  First, we need to calculate the total of the highest temperatures. 
-48 + 21 + -3 = -30
2.  Next, we need to divide the total by the number of countries.  There are 3 countries in this case, so we divide -30 by 3. 
-30 / 3 = -10

The average highest temperature of these 3 countries is -10 degrees Fahrenheit. 
 First, we have to add up all the temperatures.  The temperature in Southlandia is -48.  The temperature in Northlandia is 21.  The temperature in Midlandia is -3.  So, -48 + 21 - 3 = -30.  Next, we need to divide by 3, the number of countries, to find the average.  -30 / 3 is -10.  The answer is -10.

8-year-old child has 4 dollars.  The toy car costs 12 dollars, so he needs 12 - 4 = 8 dollars more.  He promises to save 2 dollars daily.  So, he will need 8 / 2 = 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.  The answer is 4. 
8-year-old child has $4 savings.  He wants to buy a toy car which costs $12.  He needs to save the remaining amount: $12 - $4 = $8. 

He promises to save $2 daily from his allowance.  To find out how many days it will take, we need to divide the remaining amount by the daily savings: $8 ÷ $2 = 4 days. 

The answer is 4 days. 
12 dollars is the total cost of the toy car.  The child already has $4, so he needs to save 12 - 4 = 8 dollars more.  He can save $2 daily.  To find out how many days it will take, we can divide 8 (the amount he needs to save) by 2 (the amount he saves daily).  8 / 2 = 4.  The answer is 4.

The cost of 2 packs is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars, because of the buy one get one free deal.  With the 2-dollar coupon, the total cost is 8 - 2 = 6 dollars.  Since there are 4 razors in each pack, she gets 8 razors in total.  So the cost of each individual razor is 6 dollars per 8 razors.  To get the price per single razor, we divide 6 by 8.  6 ÷ 8 = 0. 75.  The answer is 75 cents. 
 Heather originally needed 2 packs of razors.  Each pack has 4 razors, so she would need 2 x 4 = 8 razors.  Since the deal is "buy one get one free", she will have 2 packs of razors and only pay for 1.  The original price is 2 packs for 4 dollars each, or 2 x 4 = 8 dollars.  With the 2 dollar coupon, she will have 8 - 2 = 6 dollars.  This is for 2 packs of 4 razors, so each pack of razors costs 6 / 2 = 3 dollars.  Each individual razor in the pack costs 3 / 4 = 0. 75 dollars.  In cents, this is 0. 75 * 100 = 75 cents.  The answer is 75.

The pyramid is made up of 4 girls on the bottom, 3 girls on top of that, 2 girls on top of that, and the shortest girl on top.  To get the height, we subtract the height of the shortest girl from the total: 636 - 60 = 576". 

Since we're asked for feet, we divide by 12 to convert the inches to feet: 576" / 12 = 48 feet.  The answer is 48. 
9 cheerleaders are 64" each.  So the total height of the cheerleaders is 9 x 64 = 576.  The last cheerleader is 60" tall.  576 + 60 = 636.  The human pyramid is made up of the following heights:
The 4 girls on the bottom stand at 4 x 64 = 256"
On top of the 4 girls, 3 girls stand, making the total height 256 + 3 x 64 = 256 + 192 = 448"
On top of the 3 girls, 2 girls stand, making the total height 448 + 2 x 64 = 448 + 128 = 576"
The shortest girl is at the top, which is 60".

The second venue charges $25 per guest, and food is already included, so the total cost is simply 25x. 

We want the two venues to be equal in cost, so 200 + 5x = 25x.  Let's solve for x. 

Subtract 200 from both sides: 5x = 25x - 200. 

Subtract 25x from both sides: -20x = -200. 

Divide both sides by -20: x = 10. 

So, Mark needs at least 10 guests for the two venues to be equal in cost.  The answer is 10. 
 Let's find the cost of the first venue for a certain number of guests.  The flat fee is $200, and food will cost $5 for each guest, i. e.  $5x, where x is the number of guests.  The total cost is therefore 200 + 5x.  

The cost of the second venue is $25x, which does not include food costs. 

We need to find the number of guests, x, for which 200 + 5x = 25x.  

Subtract 5x from both sides: 
                200 = 20x

Divide both sides by 20: 
                x = 200 / 20
                x = 10

So, if 10 or more guests attend, the second venue is better value.  The answer is 10.

[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

Let's say David found x insects.  Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, Bodhi found 2x insects (since half is the same as multiplying by ½). 

The total number of insects they collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43

Combine like terms:

4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4x = 36

Divide by 4:

x = 9

So David found 9 insects.  Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects. 

The answer is 16. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

We know that Lily, David, and Bodhi collected 43 insects in total. 

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David.  Let's say David found x insects.  Then Lily found x + 7 insects. 

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found.  Let's say Bodhi found 2x insects (since David found half of it).  Then David found x insects. 

We can now set up an equation based on the information:

x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43

Combine like terms:

4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4x = 36

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 9

So David found 9 insects, and since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects. 

The answer is 16. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Let's start by using the information that Lily found 7 more than David.  This means that if David found x insects, Lily found x + 7 insects. 

The next piece of information is that David found half of what Bodhi found.  Let's let Bodhi's find be 2x, since David found half of that. 

Now we can set up an equation based on the information that the total number of insects collected is 43:

x + (x + 7) + 2x = 43

Combine like terms:

4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4x = 36

Divide by 4:

x = 9

So David found 9 insects.  Since Lily found 7 more than David, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects. 

The answer is 16. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, let x be the number of insects David found.  Since Bodhi found twice as many as David, Bodhi found 2x insects. 

We know that Lily found 7 more than David, which means she found x + 7 insects. 

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + (x + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

4x + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4x = 36

Divide by 4:

x = 9

So David found 9 insects.  Bodhi found 2x = 18 insects.  Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.  The answer is 16. 
 Let's lets denote the number of insects David found as D, then Bodhi found 2D since David found half of Bodhi's finds.  Lily found 7 more than David, so she found D+7.  They together collected 43 insects, so we can set up the equation:

D + (2D) + (D+7) = 43

Combine like terms:
4D + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:
4D = 36

Divide by 4:
D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, Lily found 9 + 7 = 16 insects.  The answer is 16.

[EXP] 102: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 273, [output]: 1/4 of a skein is 364 * 1/4 = 91 yards.  1/2 of a skein is 364 * 1/2 = 182 yards.  91 + 182 = 273 yards.  The answer is 273 yards. 
1/4 of a skein is 1/4 of 364 = 364 ÷ 4 = 91 yards.  1/2 of a skein is 1/2 of 364 = 364 ÷ 2 = 182 yards.  So in total, they used 91 + 182 = 273 yards.  The answer is 273. 
1/4 means 1 part out of 4, so Mariah used 1/4 * 364 = 91 yards of yarn.  1/2 means 1 part out of 2, so her grandma used 1/2 * 364 = 182 yards of yarn.  To find the total, we add 91 + 182 = 273 yards.  The answer is 273. 
1/4 of a skein of yarn is equal to 364/4 = 91 yards of yarn.  So Mariah used 91 yards.  1/2 of a skein of yarn is equal to 364/2 = 182 yards of yarn.  So Mariah's grandma used 182 yards.  Total, they used 91 + 182 = 273 yards of yarn.  The answer is 273. 
 Maria started off by using 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and then her grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn.  In total, they used 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4 of a skein of yarn.  One skein of yarn has 364 yards, so 3/4 of a skein has (3/4) * 364 = 273 yards. 

The answer is 273. 
1/4 of a skein is the same as saying 0. 25 skeins (because 1/4 can be written as a decimal as 0. 25).  Mariah used 0. 25 skeins.  Her grandma used 1/2 skein, which is the same as 0. 5 skeins.  So in total, they used 0. 25 + 0. 5 skeins.  This is 0. 75 skeins, which is the same as 3/4 skein.  There are 364 yards in a skein, so they used 364 * 0. 75 = 273 yards in total.  The answer is 273. 
1/4 + 1/2 is 3/4.  So they used 3/4 of a skein of yarn.  If there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn, then the total yards they used is 3/4 x 364.  To calculate this, first find a common denominator for 3/4, by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 4, which gives 3/4 = 3/4.  Then multiply: (3/4) x 364 = 3 x 91 = 273.  The answer is 273.

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug, so the couch's length is 2 x 8 + 2 = 18 feet. 

The answer is 18. 
 Let's start by finding the width of the rug.  The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.  The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.  Twice the width of the rug is 8 x 2 = 16 feet.  Adding 2 more feet to that makes the couch 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.  The answer is 18. 
 The chair is 3 feet wide.  The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair, so it is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide.  The couch is 2 feet longer than 2 times the width of the rug, so 2 x 8 + 2 = 18 feet.  The answer is 18. 
1.  The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.  The chair is 3 feet wide.  So the rug is 5 + 3 = 8 feet wide.

[EXP] 105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 4 packs in total were bought, including 2 strawberry packs, 1 grape pack, and 1 green apple pack.  The grape pack cost 2 dollars.  The green apple pack cost half the price of the grape pack, so it cost 1 dollar.  Together the 3 packs not strawberry cost 2 + 1 = 3 dollars.  So the 1 dollar left is for the 2 strawberry packs.  7 - 3 = 4.  So the 2 strawberry packs together cost 4 dollars, and each pack costs 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
 Suzie bought 4 packs of gum.  2 packs were strawberry, so 4 - 2 = 2 packs were not strawberry.  One pack was grape which cost $2.  The small pack of green apple gum cost half as much as the grape gum, which is 2/2 = 1 dollar.  So the total cost of the non-strawberry packs is 2 + 1 = 3 dollars.  The total cost was 7, so the cost of the strawberry packs is 7 - 3 = 4 dollars.  Since there are 2 packs of strawberry packs, the cost of each is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2 dollars. 
 We know Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.  One pack of grape gum for 2 dollars and a small pack of green apple gum for half the price of the grape gum.  So, the small pack of green apple gum would be 2 / 2 = 1 dollar. 

The total cost of 4 packs is 7 dollars.  The cost of the grape and green apple packs is 2 + 1 = 3 dollars.  So the cost of the remaining two strawberry packs is 7 - 3 = 4 dollars. 

Since there are two packs, the cost per pack is 4 / 2 = 2 dollars. 

The answer is 2. 
 Suzie bought 4 packs of gum.  Two of them were strawberry, 1 of grape, and 1 of green apple. 

Let's find the cost of each type of gum first.  

She paid 2 dollars for the grape pack.  

The 2 packs of strawberry gum and the small pack of green apple gum together cost 7 - 2 = 5 dollars. 

The 2 packs of strawberry gum together cost 5 dollars, so each one costs 5 / 2 = 2. 5 dollars. 

The answer is 2. 5. 
 Suzie started with $7.  $2 was spent on one pack of grape gum.  Half of $2, which is $1, was spent on a small pack of green apple gum.  Now we know that 1 + 1 + ? + ? = 7.  Since there were 2 packs of strawberry gum, their total cost is the remaining amount, which is $7 - (1 + 2) = $4.  4 for 2 packs of gum is 4 / 2 = $2.  The answer is 2.

[EXP] 106: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1,600, [output]: 2 x 4's cost $4 each and yield 200 sticks.  2 x 8's cost $6 each and yield 400 sticks.  If we spend the lowest amount of money, we should buy 2 x 4's because they cost less.  For each 2 x 4, 200 sticks are made.  If we buy 6 2 x 4's for $6 * 6 = $24, then we will have 200 * 6 = 1200 sticks.  The answer is 1200. 
 First, we need to figure out how many 2x4's Frederick can buy with his $24.  A 2x4 is $4, so he can buy 24 ÷ 4 = 6 2x4's.  From each 2x4, he can get 200 sticks.  So he can get 6 x 200 = 1200 sticks from the 2x4's. 
Next, we need to figure out how many 2x8's he can buy with his $24, after buying the 2x4's.  He's already spent $24 on 6 2x4's, so he has $0 left.  A 2x8 costs $6, so he can't afford to buy any 2x8's. 
So, in total, Frederick can get 1200 sticks from the 2x4's, and 0 sticks from the 2x8's.  The answer is 1200. 
24 dollars.  With this $24, we can find the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make.  First, we calculate how many 2 x 4 pieces of wood Frederick can buy: 24 / 4 = 6.  This will give him 6 x 200 = 1200 sticks.  This is cheaper than buying 2 x 8 pieces of wood as we are buying 6 x 2 x 4 wood for 24 dollars.  So Frederick buys 6 2 x 4 pieces of wood, and gets 6 x 200 sticks = 1200 sticks.  The answer is 1200.

 Mario has 6 sled dogs, all with 4 legs.  So, he needs snowshoes for 6 x 4 = 24 legs.  Since each pair of snowshoes is used for 2 legs, he will need 24 / 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes.  Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12, he will have to pay 12 x 12 = 144 dollars. 

The answer is 144. 
 Mario has 6 sled dogs, each with 4 legs.  So that's 6 x 4 = 24 legs.  
Now, each pair of snowshoes costs 12 dollars.  And Mario needs 24 legs, but it's in pairs, so we need half of that.  24 / 2 = 12.

 According to the problem, the farm has 30 cows and the zoo has twice as many cows.  Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 30 * 2 = 60 cows. 

The zoo also has 20 sheep.  The farm has half as many sheep, so it has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep. 

The farm originally had 30 cows and 10 sheep, which is 30 + 10 = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, which is 60 + 20 = 80 animals.

 Hannah needs to run 8 laps.  Each lap is 0. 25 km.  So the total distance is 8 * 0. 25 km = 2 km.  Hannah needs 60 ml of water per km.  So she will need 60 ml * 2 km = 120 ml of water.  The answer is 120 ml. 
 Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.  Since she needs to run 8 laps, and each lap is 0. 25 km, we need to calculate the total distance:

8 laps * 0. 25 km/lap = 2 km

Since Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each km, we multiply the total distance by 60:

2 km * 60 ml/km = 120 ml

The answer is 120. 
 Hannah needs 60 ml of water for each kilometer.  She is running 8 laps of 0. 25 km each.  So she is running a total of 8 * 0. 25 = 2 km.  Her total water consumption will be 60 * 2 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each km and she needs to run 8 laps.  Each lap is 0. 25 km, so 8 x 0. 25 = 2 km in total she will run.  To find out how many mL of water she needs, 2 x 60 = 120.  The answer is 120.

[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 90000, [output]:  The total cost of the house and lot is $120,000.  Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, let's call the cost of the lot x.  Then, the cost of the house is 3x.  The total cost can be represented as x + 3x = 4x = 120,000.  To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 4.  This gives us x = 30,000.  Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x = 3 * 30,000 = $90,000.  The answer is 90,000. 
 Let's use a variable to represent the cost of the lot, and call it X.  If the house cost three times as much as the lot, then the house costs 3X.  The total cost is $120,000, so we can set up an equation:

X + 3X = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4X = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

X = 30,000

So the lot cost $30,000.  Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the house cost $30,000 x 3 = $90,000. 

The answer is 90,000. 
 Let's start by using a variable to represent the cost of the lot.    Let the cost of the lot be x.  The cost of the house will be 3x because it is three times as much.  The total cost is 120,000.  The equation is x + 3x = 120,000.  Combine the x's to get 4x = 120,000.  To solve for x, divide by 4 to get x = 30,000.  The cost of the lot is 30,000.  The cost of the house is 3 times as much, which is 3 * 30,000 = 90,000.  The answer is 90,000. 
 Let's start by using the algebraic expression for the house cost: "House" = 3 x "Lot".  We know the total cost of the house and the lot is \$120,000, so we can set up the equation:

"House" + "Lot" = 120,000

Substituting the expression for the house cost, this becomes:

3 x "Lot" + "Lot" = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4 x "Lot" = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

"Lot" = 30,000

Now that we know the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house:

House = 3 x Lot
= 3 x 30,000
= \$90,000

The answer is 90,000.

36 cookies that Suzanne made means Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.  Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, Kelsie made 2 * 9 = 18 cookies.  The answer is 18. 
 First, if Suzanne made 36 cookies, and Josh made 1/4 the number of cookies that Suzanne made, then Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.  Then, if Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, she made 2 x 9 = 18 cookies.  The answer is 18. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  Suzanne made 36 cookies. 
2.  Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made.  One-fourth of 36 is 9 (36 ÷ 4 = 9).  So, Josh made 9 cookies. 
3.  Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh.  Since Josh made 9 cookies, Kelsie made 2 x 9 = 18 cookies. 

The answer is 18. 
 First, we need to find out how many Josh made.  Josh made one-fourth of Suzanne's cookies, so Josh made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.  Since Kelsie made two times as many as Josh, Kelsie made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies. 

The answer is 18. 
36 is how many cookies Suzanne made.  Josh made 1/4 that number, so Josh made 1/4 x 36 = 9 cookies.  Kelsie made 2 times more than Josh, so Kelsie made 2 x 9 = 18 cookies.   The answer is 18.

He gives half of it to his sister, so 160 / 2 = 80.  He has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left.  Then he uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner.  3/5 of 80 is (3 x 80) / 5 = 240 / 5 = 48.  So he has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.  The answer is 32. 
 Ali has 4 x 10 = 40 dollars from the $10 bills and 6 x 20 = 120 dollars from the $20 bills.  So he has a total of 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  Giving half of this to his sister will leave him with 160 / 2 = 80 dollars.  Then, he will have 80 - 3/5 * 80 = 80 - 48 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
 Ali has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills, so he has in total 4 * 10 = 40 dollars from $10 bills and 6 * 20 = 120 dollars from $20 bills.  That's a total of 40 + 120 = 160 dollars. 

He gives half of this amount to his sister, which is 160 / 2 = 80 dollars.  So he has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. 

He uses 3/5 of this amount to buy dinner, which is 80 * 3/5 = 48 dollars.  So he has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left after buying dinner. 

The answer is 32. 
10 * 4 = 40, and 20 * 6 = 120.  The total money Ali has is 40 + 120 = 160.  Ali gives half to her sister, so she gives 160 / 2 = 80 dollars to her sister.  Then Ali has 80 dollars left.  Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner, so she uses 3/5 x 80 = 48 dollars to buy dinner.  So Ali has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's start by calculating Ali's total money. 
He has 4 $10 bills and 6 $20 bills.  So he has 4 * 10 = 40 dollars from the $10 bills and 6 * 20 = 120 dollars from the $20 bills.  In total, he has 40 + 120 = 160 dollars. 
Now, Ali gives half of his money to his sister.  Half of 160 is 160 / 2 = 80. 
He gives his sister 80 dollars and he has 160 - 80 = 80 dollars left. 
He then uses 3/5 of the remaining 80 dollars to buy dinner.  3/5 of 80 is (3/5) * 80 = 48. 
He has 80 - 48 = 32 dollars left.

Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.  To find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour, add together their individual amounts: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
 Let's break it down:

* Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour. 
* Bobby can pick 1 less quart per hour than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour. 
* Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 5 x 2 = 10 quarts per hour. 
* Ricky can pick 2 fewer quarts per hour than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour. 

Now, let's add the number of quarts they can pick per hour: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29. 

The answer is 29. 
 Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.  Bobby picks 1 less quart than Tony, so he picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.  Kathy picks twice as many as Bobby, so 2 x 5 = 10.  Ricky picks 2 fewer quarts than Kathy, so 10 - 2 = 8.  To find the total number of quarts per hour, we add 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
 This type of problem is a bit more complex, but we can break it down step by step.  Let's start by finding out how many quarts each person can pick in an hour. 

Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour. 

Bobby can pick one less quart than Tony, so Bobby can pick 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour. 

Kathy can pick twice as many quarts as Bobby, so Kathy can pick 2 x 5 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour. 

Ricky can pick 2 fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour. 

To find the total number of quarts they can pick per hour, we add up the quarts each person can pick:

Tony: 6 quarts
Bobby: 5 quarts
Kathy: 10 quarts
Ricky: 8 quarts

6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29

The answer is 29. 
 Let's start by identifying how many quarts each person can pick per hour:
  Tony picks 6 quarts per hour. 
  Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour. 
  Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour. 
  Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour. 
Then, we add up how many quarts each person can pick per hour:
  Tony: 6
  Bobby: 5
  Kathy: 10
  Ricky: 8
Adding them together gives:
  6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29.

The question asks about the number of rows, so let's calculate the total rows based on the maximum number of tulips that can fit in a row. 

For red tulips, he can fit 6 in a row.  36 ÷ 6 = 6.  So, he can plant 6 rows of red tulips. 

For blue tulips, he can fit 8 in a row.  24 ÷ 8 = 3.  So, he can plant 3 rows of blue tulips. 

To find the total number of rows, we add the rows for red and blue tulips: 6 (red) + 3 (blue) = 9. 

So, Jackson can plant 9 rows of flowers.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Ada's daily electric consumption of 12 kilowatts per hour is same as 12 x 1. 50 = 18 dollars per day.  If she adds a new device that consumes 2 kilowatts per hour, that is same as 2 x 1. 50 = 3 dollars per day.  So her daily electric consumption increases by 3 dollars.  In a week (7 days), this increase is 7 x 3 = 21 dollars.  The answer is 21. 
12 kilowatts per hour is Ada's daily consumption.  The new device will consume 2 kilowatts per hour.  So her total daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour. 

Ada's daily consumption is 14 kilowatts per hour.  And if a kilowatt per hour is $1. 50, we can find her daily consumption cost by multiplying 14 by 1. 50.  14 x 1. 50 = 21. 

Now, we need to find out how much she paid weekly.  Her daily consumption is 21 dollars.  For one week, she will need 7 days.  7 x 21 is 147.  So her weekly consumption cost will be 147 dollars. 

At first, her daily consumption cost was 12 x 1. 5 = 18.  18 * 7 = 126.  So her weekly consumption cost was 126 dollars. 

The difference between 126 and 147 is 147 - 126 = 21.  So the difference between her monthly bill before and after adding the new device is 21 dollars.  The answer is 21.

[EXP] 128: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 1 person paints half a house in 5 days, so 1 person paints the whole house in 10 days.  If 5 people paint the same house, they will take 10 ÷ 5 = 2 days.  Since we want to know the number of hours, we need to convert days to hours.  Each day has 24 hours, so 2 days is 2 * 24 = 48 hours.  The answer is 48 hours. 
1 person can paint half a house in 5 days, so 1 person can paint a whole house in 10 days (since 2 half-houses = 1 whole house).  If 5 people can paint a whole house together, then they can paint a whole house 5 times faster than 1 person.  So the time it would take is 10 / 5 = 2 days.  To find the number of hours, multiply the number of days by 24.  2 days * 24 hours/day = 48 hours.  The answer is 48.

In total, both Ophelia and Jenna have 20 + 68 = 88 sofas.  Add that to their chairs = 22 + 66 = 88.  So they have 88 sofas and 88 chairs altogether.  The answer is 176.

[EXP] 130: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Tom had 48 dollars in total.  The CD cost 4 dollars.  So he had 48 - 4 = 44 dollars left to use.  To find how many more CDs he could have bought, we divide 44 by 4.  44 / 4 = 11.  The answer is 11. 
 Tom originally has $48.  The headphone set cost an unknown amount.  He spent $4 on the CD.  So the cost of the headphone set is 48 - 4 = 44.  He paid $4 for the CD, so 44 must be the cost of the headphone set. 

Let's solve this problem. 

Let the cost of the headphone set be x. 

44 = x


Let's get the cost of the CD in dollars. 
After buying the CD, Tom paid 48 dollars. 
So before buying the CD, Tom had 48 - 4 dollars. 
This means he had 44 dollars. 

The amount Tom could have been able to buy in more CDs is 44 / 4. 


Let's solve it. 
44 / 4 = 11

4 hours * 8 weeks is 32 hours.  But Josh also spent more hours on some occasions.  For 2 weeks, he spent 5 hours each, so that’s 10 hours.  Another time, he spent 6 hours.  32 hours + 10 hours + 6 hours = 48 hours.  The answer is 48. 
4 hours is the regular amount of time Josh worked out each week.  Since he did this for 8 weeks, he spent 8 x 4 = 32 hours in total.  However, he also spent 5 hours each for 2 weeks, which is 5 * 2 = 10 hours.  Additionally, he spent 6 hours in one week.  So we add these to the total hours he worked out: 32 + 10 + 6 = 48.  The answer is 48. 
8 weeks, except for some weeks Josh spent more time working out.  One time, he spent 5 hours for 2 weeks, which is 10 hours.  Another time, he spent 6 hours in one week, which is 6 hours.  In total, he spent 4 hours for 8 weeks (4 * 8 = 32 hours), and additional 10 hours and 6 hours, for a total of 32 + 10 + 6 = 48 hours.  The answer is 48. 
 Josh worked out for 4 hours each day, except for some occasions.  At first, we need to calculate the total hours he worked out normally. 
4 hours per week for 8 weeks is 4 * 8 = 32 hours. 
Then, for 2 consecutive weeks, he spent 5 hours each.  That is 5 x 2 = 10 hours. 
And at another time, he spent 6 hours in one week.  So, in total, Josh worked out 10 + 6 = 16 hours. 
The total number of hours Josh worked out across the 8 weeks is 32 + 16 = 48 hours.  The answer is 48.

Then, 3 times fewer people get on, so 21 / 3 = 7 people get on.  So 59 - 7 = 52 people are riding the bus after the second stop.  The answer is 52. 
48 people are riding the bus.  On the first stop, 8 passengers get off.  So, there are 48 - 8 = 40 people left.  Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get in.  So, 8 x 5 = 40 people get in.  So, there are still 40 left, plus the 40 that got in, which makes 80 people.  On the second stop, 21 passengers get off.  So, there are 80 - 21 = 59 people left.  Then, 3 times fewer passengers (21) get on.  So, 21/3 = 7 people get in.  So, 59 minus 7 = 52 people left.  The answer is 52.

 Let's start by finding Jame's age now.  If he will be 27 in 5 years, that means his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years.   His cousin's age in 8 years can be found by first calculating Jame's age in 8 years, which is 22 + 8 = 30.  His cousin's age in 8 years will be 30 - 5 = 25.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Errol bought 2 monitors and a computer.  The total cost is $2400.  The computer costs $1,100.  So the cost of the 2 monitors and the printer is $2400 - $1100 = $1300.  The printer costs $400 less than the computer, so the cost of the printer is $1100 - $400 = $700.  The cost of 2 monitors is $1300 - $700 = $600.  Each monitor costs $600 / 2 = $300.  The answer is 300. 
 Errol paid 2400 dollars for the items.  He bought a $1100 computer and a monitor.  Since the printer cost $400 less than the computer, the printer costs $1100 - 400 = $700. 

So, 2400 = 1100 (computer) + 700 (printer) + 2 monitors

2400 = 1800 + 2 monitors

2 monitors = 2400 - 1800
2 monitors = 600

1 monitor = 600 / 2
1 monitor = 300

The answer is 300. 
 Errol bought a computer, 2 monitors, and a printer for $2,400.  
     He paid $400 less for the printer than the computer. 
     If the computer cost $1,100, then the printer cost $700 (1,100 - 400). 

     Total price is $2,400, of which 1,100 is for the computer and 700 is for the printer.  That leaves $2,400 - 1,100 - 700 = $600 for the 2 monitors. 

     Each monitor costs the same.  600 / 2 = 300.  The answer is 300.

The boys brought back 60 shells each, so 60 * 10 = 600 shells were brought by the boys.  The girls brought as many as the boys plus 4 times as many.  So they brought 60 + 60 * 4 = 60 + 240 = 300.  Since there are 10 girls, they brought 300 / 10 = 30 shells each.  The answer is 30. 
20 kids went on the trip.  They were divided into 2 equal groups.  So there were 10 boys and 10 girls.  The boys brought 60 shells each.  So together they brought 10 x 60 = 600 shells.  The girls brought their equal to the boys' shells plus 4 times the boys' shells.  So the girls brought 60 + 4 x 60 = 60 + 240 = 300.  But there were 10 girls, so that means each girl brought 300 / 10 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
20 kids went on the trip.  They were split into two groups.  If they are equal, then each group must have 20 ÷ 2 = 10 kids.  The boys brought back 60 shells each.  So the boys brought 10 × 60 = 600 shells.  The girls brought back an amount equal to the boys plus four times as many as the boys.  The plural form of "boy" is "boys", so it should be four times as many as the boys brought.  Four times 60 is 240.  So the girls brought 240 + 60 = 300 shells.  Since there were 10 girls, each girl brought back 300 ÷ 10 = 30 shells.  The answer is 30.

 Nick started with twice as many candies as George, so let's say Nick had 2x candies and George had x candies.  Then George ate 5 candies and had 3 left, so he had x - 5 candies left.  Since we know he has 3 left, we can say x - 5 = 3, which means x = 8.  Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, Nick had 2x = 2(8) = 16 candies.  The answer is 16. 
 Nick has twice as many candies as George.  This means Nick's initial candies is 2x, and George's initial candies is x.  

George ate 5 candies, and now he has 3 candies left, so George had 3 + 5 candies before he ate, that is 8 candies.  So x = 8.

The total thickness of all the books is 31 + 50 + 45 + 62.  31 + 50 = 81, and 81 + 45 = 126, and 126 + 62 = 188.  The answer is 188. 
 Let's start with the fourth book being twice as thick as the first book, which is 2 x 31 = 62 mm. 

The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so the second book is 5 mm thicker than the third book.  The second book is 50 mm, so the third book is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 

The first book is 31 mm thick. 

To find the total thickness, add the thickness of all four books:

 Emma started with a goal of making 72 vlogs per month.  She made 18 in the first week, 21 in the second week, and 15 in the third week.  So the total vlogs she made so far are 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.  To complete the goal of 72 vlogs, she needs 72 - 54 = 18 more vlogs. 

The answer is 18. 
72 vlogs per month is the total amount Emma aims to make.  We know she made 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.  So we subtract 54 from 72.  72 - 54 = 18.  The answer is 18. 
 Emma was able to make 18 vlogs for the first week, 21 vlogs for the second week, and 15 vlogs for the third week.  To find the total number of vlogs she made, add these numbers: 18 + 21 + 15 = 54.

18 dollars is shared among 3 boys.  So each boy gets 18 / 3 = 6 dollars.  The eldest added $5 to his share, so he had 6 + 5 = 11 dollars.  Then he added $10, so now he had 11 + 10 = 21 dollars.  After spending $8, he had 21 - 8 = 13 dollars.  After tripling his money, he would have 13 x 3 = 39 dollars.  The answer is 39. 
1.  $18 is shared among 3 boys, so the eldest had 1/3 of 18 = 6 dollars initially.  2.  The eldest added 5 dollars so he had 6 + 5 = 11 dollars.  3.  The next day, he added 10 dollars so he had 11 + 10 = 21 dollars.  4.  He spent 8 dollars, so he had 21 - 8 = 13 dollars left.  5.  He tripled the 13 dollars so he had 13 * 3 = 39 dollars.  The answer is 39. 
18 dollars are shared equally among 3 boys.  So initially, each boy has 18 ÷ 3 = 6 dollars.  The eldest boy has 6 dollars.  He adds 5 more, so he has 6 + 5 = 11 dollars.  Then he adds 10 more, so he has 11 + 10 = 21 dollars.  Then he spends 8 dollars, so he has 21 - 8 = 13 dollars.  He then saves more and triples the amount, so he has 13 × 3 = 39 dollars.  The answer is 39. 
18 dollars are shared among 3 boys.  The total money is 18 / 3 = 6 dollars for each boy.  

The eldest boy has 6 dollars at first.  He adds $5, which makes 6 + 5 = 11 dollars.  The next day, he adds another $10, which makes 11 + 10 = 21 dollars. 

He then spends $8, leaving him with 21 - 8 = 13 dollars.  

To triple the amount of money he has left after spending $8, he multiplies 13 by 3, which is 13 x 3 = 39.  The answer is 39. 
1.  First, the eldest boy will have a share.  18 / 3 = 6.  So he had 6 dollars. 
2.  He will add 5 and 10 more.  6 + 5 = 11, then 11 + 10 = 21. 
3.  Then he needs some money and spends 8.  He will be left with 21 - 8 = 13. 
4.  Finally, he triples 13 by multiplying it by 3.  3 x 13 = 39.  The answer is 39.

[EXP] 142: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's first find the number of days in each half of April.  Since April has 30 days, the first half would be 15 days and the second half would be 15 days. 

Let x be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half.  Then, the total amount saved in the first half would be 15x. 

Elvis wants to save twice as much in the second half, so he would save 2x each day.  Since there are 15 days in the second half, the total amount saved in the second half would be 2x * 15 = 30x. 

The total amount Elvis wants to save in the month is $1125, so we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month.  Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he would save:

2x = 2(25) = 50

The answer is 50. 
 Since Elvis wants to save a total of 1125 dollars, and we don't know how much he has to save in the first half, let's first figure out how much he'll have saved after the first half of the month.  Then we can subtract that from his target to find out how much he has to save in the second half. 

Let's say he saves x dollars per day in the first half of the month.  There are 15 days in the first half (April 1-15), so he'll have saved 15x dollars.  In the second half of the month, he wants to save twice as much as he saves in the first half, so he'll save 2*15x=30x dollars in the second half. 

We know that the total amount he saves throughout the entire month should equal the target amount of 1125 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125

Combine like terms on the left side:

45x = 1125

Divide both sides by 45:

x = 25

So Elvis has to save 25 dollars per day in the first half of the month.  Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half as he saves in the first half, he'll have to save 2*25=50 dollars per day in the second half of the month. 

The answer is 50.

She bought 5 oranges for 0. 80 each, so that's 5 * 0. 80 = 4 dollars.  She bought 6 peaches for 0. 75 each, so that's 6 * 0. 75 = 4. 50 dollars.  In total, she spent 4. 50 + 4 + 4. 50 = 13 dollars.  If she gave 20 dollars, she got 20 - 13 = 7 dollars in change.  The answer is 7. 
 Verna bought 3 apples at $1. 50 each.  3 x 1. 50 = 4. 50.  She bought 5 oranges at $0. 80 each.  5 x 0. 80 = 4. 00.  She bought 6 peaches at $0. 75 each.  6 x 0. 75 = 4. 50.  In total, she spent 4. 50 + 4. 00 + 4. 50 = 13. 00.  She gave $20.  So she received $20 - 13. 00 = 7. 00.  The answer is 7. 00. 
 Verna spends money to buy fruit.  First, let's find out how much she spent.  Three apples at $1. 50 each is 3 x 1. 50 = 4. 50.  Five oranges at $0. 80 each is 5 x 0. 80 = 4. 00.  Six peaches at $0. 75 each is 6 x 0. 75 = 4. 50.  The total is 4. 50 + 4. 00 + 4. 50 = 13. 00.  If she gives $20, she will receive $20 - 13. 00 = 7. 00.  The answer is 7. 
 Verna bought 3 apples for 1. 50 each, so she spent 1. 50 x 3 = 4. 50 dollars on apples.  She bought 5 oranges for 0. 80 each, so she spent 0. 80 x 5 = 4. 00 dollars on oranges.  She bought 6 peaches for 0. 75 each, so she spent 0. 75 x 6 = 4. 50 dollars on peaches.  In total, she spent 4. 50 + 4. 00 + 4. 50 = 13. 00 dollars.  She gave 20 dollars at the store, and spent 13.  So, her change is 20 - 13 = 7.  The answer is 7. 
 Verna started with $20.  She bought three apples for 3 * 1. 50 = 4. 50, five oranges for 5 * 0. 80 = 4. 00 and 6 peaches for 6 * 0. 75 = 4. 50.  So in total Verna spent 4. 50 + 4. 00 + 4. 50 = 13 dollars.  After paying, she had 20 - 13 = 7 dollars left as change.  The answer is 7.

[EXP] 144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 0. 8 * 20 = 16 for Jairus.  0. 5 * 20 = 10 for Jenny.  Jairus will get 16 - 10 = 6 dollars more than Jenny.  The answer is 6. 
 Jairus gets 0. 8 dollars for each task, so he gets 20 x 0. 8 = 16 dollars.  Jenny gets 0. 5 dollars for each task, so she gets 20 x 0. 5 = 10 dollars.  To find out how much more Jairus gets, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings.  16 - 10 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
 Jairus gets 0. 8 dollars for each task.  Jenny gets 0. 5 dollars for each task.  So Jairus will get 20 * 0. 8 = 16 dollars, and Jenny will get 20 * 0. 5 = 10 dollars.  To find out how much more Jairus will get than Jenny, subtract their earnings: 16 - 10 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
 Let's calculate how much Jairus and Jenny got in total.  Jairus gets \$0. 8 for each task and finished 20 tasks, so he got 20 x 0. 8 = 16 dollars.  Jenny gets $0. 5 for each task and finished 20 tasks, so she got 20 x 0. 5 = 10 dollars.  Jairus gets $16 and Jenny gets $10.  To find how much more Jairus got, subtract Jenny's amount from Jairus's amount: 16 - 10 = 6.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.  Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them.  Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad. 

Let's let x be the amount Brad gets.  Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x. 

The total amount they have to divide between them is 100 dollars.  So, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 100

Combine like terms:

5x = 100

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 20

So Brad gets 20 dollars.  Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars. 

The answer is 80. 
100 dollars in total, Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.  Let's call the amount Brad gets "x".  Then Jeff gets 4x.  The total is 100, so x + 4x = 100.  Simplify, 5x = 100.  Divide both sides by 5, x = 20.  Jeff gets 4 times as much, so Jeff gets 4 x 20 = 80 dollars.  The answer is 80. 
100 dollars need to be divided between Jeff and Brad.  Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.  Let's say Brad gets x.  Then Jeff gets 4x.  Together they get 5x.  So 5x = 100.  Divide both sides by 5, and you get x = 20.  Jeff gets 4 times that, which is 4 * 20 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
100 dollars needs to be divided between Jeff and Brad.  Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.  Let's let B be the amount Brad gets.  Since Jeff gets 4 times as much, Jeff gets 4B. 

The total amount they get together is 100, so we can set up the equation: B + 4B = 100

Combine like terms: 5B = 100

Divide both sides by 5: B = 20

Brad gets $20.  Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 x 20 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
100 dollars were given to Jeff and Brad.  Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so let's say Brad gets x dollars and Jeff gets 4x dollars.  So, x + 4x = 100.  5x = 100.  x = 20.  So Brad gets 20 dollars and Jeff gets 4x = 4 x 20 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
100 dollars are to be divided between Jeff and Brad.  Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.  We can let the amount Brad gets be B.  So Jeff gets 4B.  4B + B = 5B.  Since they get all 100 dollars, 5B = 100.  B = 20.  Jeff gets 4 times as much, so Jeff gets 4B = 4 x 20 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
100 dollars are to be divided between Jeff and Brad.  We don't know how much Brad gets yet, so let's call it x.  Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4x.  We can set up the equation: x + 4x = 100.  We can combine x and 4x on the left side to get 5x.  So 5x = 100.  Dividing both sides by 5, we get x = 20.  So Brad gets 20 dollars.  Since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, Jeff gets 4 * 20 = 80 dollars.  The answer is 80. 
 Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them.  That means both of them will get some amount of money that adds up to 100 dollars.  Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so let's say Brad gets x dollars.  Then Jeff gets 4x dollars.  Together, they get x + 4x = 5x dollars.  But this should equal 100 dollars, so we set up the equation 5x = 100.  To solve for x, we divide both sides by 5: 5x / 5 = 100 / 5.  This gives us x = 20.  So Brad gets 20 dollars.  But we need to find out how much Jeff gets, which is 4 times as much.  Jeff gets 4x = 4(20) = 80 dollars.  The answer is 80.

[EXP] 146: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 3 miles is the distance to Jeff's work.  Since he goes there and back, he walks 3 + 3 = 6 miles each day.  He has to work 5 times a week.  6 * 5 is 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Jeff walks to work and back, which is 3 miles x 2 = 6 miles each day, 5 times a week.  6 x 5 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
3 miles for there, and 3 miles for back, so that is 3 + 3 = 6 miles for each day.  He works 5 days a week, so 6 * 5 = 30 miles.  The answer is 30. 
 Jeff originally walks 3 miles to work and 3 miles to come back.  So he walks 3 + 3 = 6 miles per workday.  5 workdays a week, he walks 6 * 5 = 30 miles.  The answer is 30. 
3 miles away is the distance Jeff has to walk to his work.  For each day he works, he walks there and back.  So he walks a total of 3 + 3 = 6 miles.  6 miles, five times a week, is 6 x 5 = 30.  The answer is 30.

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 130, [output]: 26 letters are in the alphabet.  Elise writes the entire alphabet twice, which is 26 + 26 = 52 letters.  She then writes half the alphabet, which is 26/2 = 13 letters.  After rewriting everything she has already written, she added another 52 letters.  In total, she has written 52 + 13 + 52 = 117 letters.  The answer is 117. 
 Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, so she writes 26 letters x 2 times = 52 letters.  Then, she writes half of it once, which is 13 letters.  She re-writes everything she has already written, so that's 52 + 52 = 104 letters.  Then, she adds the 13 letters, so 104 + 13 = 117.  The answer is 117.

[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 81, [output]:  We start with 3 families. 

The first round of calls results in 3 * 3 = 9 families receiving the call. 

The second round of calls results in 9 * 3 = 27 families receiving the call. 

The third round of calls results in 27 * 3 = 81 families receiving the call. 

The fourth round of calls results in 81 * 3 = 243 families receiving the call. 

The answer is 243. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

Initially, Ali calls 3 families. 

In the first round, 3 families each call 3 other families, so 3 x 3 = 9 families are added. 

In the second round, the families contacted in the first round call 3 more families each, so 9 x 3 = 27 families are added. 

In the third round, the families contacted in the second round call 3 more families each, so 27 x 3 = 81 families are added. 

In the fourth round, the families contacted in the third round call 3 more families each, so 81 x 3 = 243 families are added. 

However, we only want to know how many families will be notified in the fourth round, not the total number of affected families.  The families contacted in the fourth round were not contacted in previous rounds (i. e. , they were already notified).  Therefore, each of these families will add 3 new families, and 243 families will be notified in the fourth round. 

The answer is 243.

[EXP] 149: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Mark lost weight for 3 months.  He lost 10 pounds per month, so in total he lost 10 * 3 = 30 pounds.  His final weight is 70 pounds, which means his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
 Mark's final weight was 70 pounds.  For 3 months, he lost 10 pounds per month.  That's a total of 3 x 10 = 30 pounds.  So his initial weight was 70 + 30 pounds.  70 + 30 is 100.  The answer is 100. 
 We will start with Mark's final weight, which is 70 pounds.  Since he lost 10 pounds per month, he lost 3 x 10 = 30 pounds in total.  So his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
 Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months.  So he lost 10 x 3 = 30 pounds.  He finally has 70 pounds, so his initial weight will be 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
 Let's break it down:

Mark lost 10 pounds per month for 3 months. 

So, total weight lost = 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

Since his final weight was 70 pounds, his initial weight must have been:

Initial weight = Final weight + Total weight lost
= 70 pounds + 30 pounds
= 100 pounds

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
 Mark's initial weight, let's call it x.  He lost 10 pounds a month for 3 months.  So he lost 10 * 3 = 30 pounds.  His final weight was 70.  So his initial weight x is 70 + 30.  70 + 30 = 100.  The answer is 100.

[EXP] 150: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 398, [output]:  Jonathan's play set needs to be 5 times larger than James's play set, which has 80 toys.  So Jonathan's play set needs to have 5 x 80 = 400 toys.  Since he needs 2 more toys than what he currently has, he already has 400 - 2 = 398 toys.  The answer is 398. 
 We know that Jonathan will have a set 5 times larger than James's set of 80 toys.  So Jonathan's set will have 80 * 5 = 400 toys.  Since he needs 2 more toys than he currently has to get to 400, he must currently have 400 - 2 = 398 toys.  The answer is 398. 
 According to the problem, Jonathan needs to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, which had 80 toys.  This means that Jonathan needs a play set of 80 * 5 = 400 toys.  He needs 2 more toys than he already has to achieve this.  So, the number of toys Jonathan currently has is 400 - 2 = 398.  The answer is 398. 
 Jonathan needs 5 times as many toys as James's play set.  James's play set has 80 toys.  So Jonathan needs 5 x 80 = 400 toys.  But he also needs 2 more toys than he already has.  Let's find out how many toys he has already.  He has an unknown number of toys, let's call it x.  Then he needs x + 2 = 400.  We can subtract 2 from both sides to get x = 398.  The answer is 398.

[EXP] 151: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's calculate the subtotal of Daniel's items:

5 notebooks at $1. 50 each = 5 x 1. 50 = 7. 50
2 pens at $0. 25 each = 2 x 0. 25 = 0. 50
1 calculator at $12 = 12
1 geometry set at $10 = 10

Subtotal = 7. 50 + 0. 50 + 12 + 10 = 30. 00

Then, Daniel gets a 10% discount on the subtotal:

Discount = 10% of 30. 00 = 0. 10 x 30. 00 = 3. 00

Total amount Daniel has to spend = Subtotal - Discount = 30. 00 - 3. 00 = 27. 00

The answer is 27. 00. 
5 notebooks at $1. 50 each will be 5 x 1. 50 = 7. 50.  2 pens at $0. 25 each will be 2 x 0. 25 = 0. 5.  A calculator costs 12 dollars and a geometry set costs 10 dollars.  In total, Daniel will spend 7. 50 + 0. 5 + 12 + 10 = 30 dollars.  A 10% discount is 30 * 0. 10 = 3 dollars.  So Daniel has to spend 30 - 3 = 27 dollars.  The answer is 27. 
 First let's calculate the total cost before the discount:

Notebooks: 5 x $1. 50 = $7. 50
Pens: 2 x $0. 25 = $0. 50
Calculator: 1 x $12 = $12
Geometry set: 1 x $10 = $10
Total cost before discount: $7. 50 + $0. 50 + $12 + $10 = $30. 00

To find the discount, multiply the total cost before discount by the discount percentage:
$30. 00 x 10% = $30. 00 x 0. 10 = $3. 00

Now subtract the discount from the total cost before discount:
$30. 00 - $3. 00 = $27. 00

The answer is 27. 
 First, let's find out the total cost without the discount.  5 notebooks will cost 5 * 1. 5 = 7. 5 dollars.  2 pens will cost 2 * 0. 25 = 0. 50 dollars.  1 calculator will cost 12 dollars.  1 geometry set will cost 10 dollars.  The total cost without discount is 7. 5 + 0. 5 + 12 + 10 = 30.  Then there is a 10% discount.  This discount is 30 * 0. 1 = 3.  After the discount, the cost is 30 - 3 = 27.  The answer is 27.

In total, Carly spent: 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 dollars
If she gives a 50-dollar bill, she will get 50 - 33 dollars back: 50 - 33 = 17 dollars
The answer is 17. 
 First, Carly's order includes 5 hamburgers at $4 each, which is 5 x 4 = 20 dollars.  Then, she ordered 10 packs of potato fries at $0. 30 each, which is 10 x 0. 3 = 3 dollars.  Finally, she ordered 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each, which is 5 x 2 = 10 dollars.  So the total cost of her order is 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 dollars.  Carly gives a 50-dollar bill, so she will get 50 - 33 dollars back.  50 - 33 is 17.  The answer is 17. 
 Carly orders 5 hamburgers for 4 dollars each.  That is 5 x 4 = 20 dollars.  She also orders 10 packs of potato fries for 0. 30 each.  10 x 0. 30 = 3.  3 dollars for fries.  She also orders 5 cans of fruit drinks for 2 dollars each.  5 x 2 = 10 dollars for the drinks.  Total cost is 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 dollars.  She pays with a 50-dollar bill.  Change will be 50 - 33 = 17 dollars.  The answer is 17. 
 Carly is paying with a 50-dollar bill.  She orders hamburgers, fries, and fruit drinks.  Hamburger bills are $4 * 5 = $20, fries are $0. 30 * 10 = $3, and fruit drinks are $2 * 5 = $10.  So the total bill is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.  Carly gives a 50-dollar bill so she gets 50 - 33 = 17 dollars back.  The answer is 17. 
50 dollar bill for 1 purchase.  

5 hamburgers for 4 dollars each is 5 x 4 = 20 dollars. 
10 packs of potato fries for 0. 30 dollars each is 10 x 0. 30 = 3 dollars. 
5 cans of fruit drinks for 2 dollars each is 5 x 2 = 10 dollars. 

Together it is 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 dollars. 
Carly gave a 50 dollar bill so she will get 50 - 33 = 17.  The answer is 17.

[EXP] 153: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 450, [output]: 30% of 1000 is 30/100 * 1000 = 300.  1000 + 2500 = 3500.  The commission over 1000 is 10% of 1500.  10/100 * 1500 = 150.  300 + 150 = 450.  The answer is 450. 
30% of $1000 is $300.  For sales over $1000, she gets an additional 10%.  So for sales from $1001 to $2500, she gets 10% of $1500, which is $150.  300 + 150 = 450.  The answer is 450. 
30% commission on $1000 is 1000 * 0. 3 = 300.  Sales over $1000 are 2500 - 1000 = 1500.  A 10% commission on 1500 is 1500 * 0. 1 = 150.  300 + 150 is 450.  The answer is 450. 
30% of $1000 is 30/100 x 1000 = 300.  So for sales up to $1000, the commission is $300.  For sales above $1000, there's an additional 10% commission.  The sales above $1000 are 2500 - 1000 = 1500.  10% of 1500 is 10/100 x 1500 = 150.  So the total commission earned by Antonella is 300 + 150 = 450.  The answer is 450. 
30% of $1000 is 0. 30 x 1000 = 300 dollars.  That is the maximum commission for Antonella, for sales up to $1000.  The remainder of the sales, $1500, gets an additional 10% commission.  0. 10 x 1500 = 150 dollars.  So total commission is 300 + 150 = 450.  The answer is 450. 
30% of $1000 is 0. 3 x 1000 = $300.  
From $1000, sales increase by $1500 (2500 - 1000).  For this amount, she earned an additional 10% commission.  The amount is 1500 x 0. 1 = $150. 
Total commission earned by Antonella is $300 (for the first $1000) + $150 (for the sales over $1000) = $450. 
The answer is 450.

He already has 48 bottles, so he needs 140 - 48 = 92 more bottles.  The answer is 92.

[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 54, [output]:  When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.  When the water is warm, it takes Ray 2 minutes more than twice as long to swim a mile.  Twice as long as 16 is 2 x 16 = 32, so adding 2 minutes makes it 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.  To find the difference in time between the two days, subtract the time in cold water from the time in warm water.  34 - 16 = 18.  This is the difference in time to swim a mile. 

To find the difference in time to swim 3 miles, multiply the difference in time to swim a mile by 3.  3 x 18 = 54.  The answer is 54. 
 When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.  When the water is warm, he swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long.  Twice as long as 16 minutes is 16 x 2 = 32 minutes, and 2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.  So he swims a mile in 34 minutes in the warm water. 

To swim 3 miles, he will take 3 times as long in both the cold and warm water.  So he will take 3 x 16 minutes = 48 minutes in the cold water and 3 x 34 minutes = 102 minutes in the warm water. 

The difference between 102 minutes and 48 minutes is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.  Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles in the warm water.  The answer is 54. 
 Let's first find how long it takes Ray to swim a mile on a hot day:
The water is warm, and Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does on a cold day.  Since it takes him 16 minutes on a cold day, twice that is 2 x 16 = 32 minutes.  Adding 2 minutes, it takes him 32 + 2 = 34 minutes to swim a mile on a hot day. 

Now, let's find how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both hot and cold days:
On a cold day, it takes Ray 16 minutes to swim a mile.  To swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 x 16 = 48 minutes. 
On a hot day, it takes Ray 34 minutes to swim a mile.  To swim 3 miles, it will take him 3 x 34 = 102 minutes. 

To find how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day, subtract the time on a cold day from the time on a hot day:
102 - 48 = 54 minutes
The answer is 54. 
 When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.  When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long.  So 2 more minutes than twice as long is 2 + 2*16 = 34 minutes.  Cold day: 16 minutes and warm day: 34 minutes.  So 34 - 16 = 18 minutes longer for the warm day. 

When it comes to 3 miles, the time difference will be the same.  3 miles on a cold day would be 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.  3 miles on a warm day would be 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.  The time difference is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes. 

The answer is 54 minutes. 
16 minutes is how long it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a cold day.  To swim 3 miles on a cold day, it would take 3 x 16 = 48 minutes. 

On a hot day, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long.  Twice as long as 16 minutes would be 2 x 16 = 32 minutes.  Then add 2 minutes more to get 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.  To swim 3 miles on a hot day, it would take 3 x 34 = 102 minutes. 

102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes.  The answer is 54. 

Note: I'm following the same pattern as the previous examples, breaking down the problem into smaller parts and using calculations to find the answer.  In this case, I first found the time it takes Ray to swim 1 mile on a cold day, then multiplied it by 3 to find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a cold day.  Then, I found the time it takes him to swim 1 mile on a hot day, multiplied it by 3 to find the time it takes him to swim 3 miles on a hot day, and finally subtracted the cold water time from the hot water time to find the difference.

[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]: 40 dollars for the foot-long fish sub and thrice as much for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub means that the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs 40 * 3 = 120 dollars.  In total, you pay 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  The answer is 160. 
 A foot-long fish sub costs 40 dollars.  A six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs three times as much, so it costs 3 x 40 = 120 dollars.  So in total you pay 40 + 120 = 160 dollars for both subs.  The answer is 160. 
40 dollars is the cost of the foot-long fish sub.  A six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times more expensive, so the cost is 40 * 3 = 120.  Total cost is the sum of the two: 40 + 120 = 160.  The answer is 160. 
 Let's first find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub since it's thrice the fish sub.  Since the fish sub costs 40 dollars, the cold-cut combo sub is 3 times that, which is 40 * 3 = 120.  To find the total cost, we add the cost of both subs: 40 + 120 = 160 dollars.  The answer is 160. 
1st, find out how much you pay for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.  Thrice as much means you pay 3 times as much.  You paid 40 dollars for a Fish sub, so 3 times of that would be 40 x 3 = 120 dollars.  So, you pay 120 dollars for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.  Together, you pay 120 + 40 dollars = 160 dollars.  The answer is 160.

 A bag had 21 buttons.  7 buttons had 2 holes and the rest had 4 holes.  7 x 2 = 14 holes and 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes.  14 x 4 = 56.  14 + 56 is 70.  The answer is 70. 
7 buttons had 2 holes each, so 7 * 2 = 14 holes.  The rest of the buttons had 4 holes.  There were 21 buttons originally, so 21 - 7 = 14 buttons with 4 holes each.  14 * 4 = 56.  So in total 14 + 56 = 70 holes.  The answer is 70. 
7 buttons had 2 holes each, so those have 7 x 2 = 14 holes. 

The rest of the buttons had 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, and each of those buttons had 4 holes.  So the rest of the buttons had 14 x 4 = 56 holes. 

The total number of holes in all the buttons is 14 + 56 = 70.  The answer is 70. 
7 buttons had 2 holes.  So that's 7 x 2 = 14 holes.  The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each.  If there were 21 buttons in total, and 7 had 2 holes, then 21 - 7 = 14 buttons had 4 holes.  14 x 4 = 56.  So the bags of buttons had a total of 14 + 56 = 70 holes.  The answer is 70. 
7 buttons had 2 holes each.  7 x 2 = 14 holes.  The rest of the buttons (all except the 7 buttons with 2 holes) had 4 holes each.  There were 21 - 7 = 14 buttons left.  14 buttons with 4 holes each means 14 x 4 = 56 holes.  In total, there are 14 holes from the 7 buttons with 2 holes, plus 56 holes from the rest of the buttons, which is 14 + 56 = 70.  The answer is 70. 
 Let's first figure out the number of buttons that had 4 holes.  The total number of buttons is 21, and 7 of them had 2 holes.  So, 21 - 7 = 14 buttons have 4 holes.  Now, we need to find the total number of holes in all the buttons.  The 7 buttons with 2 holes have a total of 7 x 2 = 14 holes.  The 14 buttons with 4 holes have a total of 14 x 4 = 56 holes.  Adding these together, we get 14 + 56 = 70.  The answer is 70. 
7 buttons had 2 holes each.  So 2 * 7 = 14 holes.  The rest of the buttons had 4 holes each.  Originally there were 21 buttons.  The 7 buttons with 2 holes took away 7 buttons.  So the remaining buttons are 21 - 7 = 14.  These 14 buttons had 4 holes each.  So 14 * 4 = 56 holes.  In total, there are 14 holes from the 7 buttons and 56 holes from the rest of the buttons.  So in total there are 14 + 56 = 70 holes.  The answer is 70.

[EXP] 162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.  Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 130 x 2 = 260 pounds.  The total weight of the three friends is 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 pounds.  To find the average, divide by 3: 540 / 3 = 180.  The answer is 180. 
 First, find the weight of Susan.  She weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so 150 - 20 = 130 pounds. 

Then, find the weight of Bob.  He weighs twice as much as Susan, so 2 x 130 = 260 pounds. 

Now, add the weights of the 3 friends together.  150 + 130 + 260 = 540. 

Finally, divide the total weight by the number of friends.  540 ÷ 3 = 180.  The answer is 180. 
 Let's find the weights of Susan and Bob first.  If Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, that means Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.  If Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, that means Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds. 

Now that we have the weights of all 3 friends, we can find their average.  To find the average, we add up all the weights and divide by 3. 

150 + 130 + 260 = 540

Divide 540 by 3:

540 ÷ 3 = 180

So the average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds.  The answer is 180. 
 First, we find Susan's weight.  If Mark weighs 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less, then Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.  Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 130 * 2 = 260 pounds.  To find the average of 3 numbers, we need to add the numbers and divide by 3.  So, we have: (150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = (540) / 3 = 180.  The answer is 180. 
 Let's find the weight of each person first.  Mark weighs 150 pounds.  Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.  Then, Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.  

To calculate the average weight, we add up the weights and divide by the number of people.  So, the average weight is ( 150 + 130 + 260 ) / 3 = (540) / 3 = 180.  The answer is 180.

[EXP] 163: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  Initially, the sun and the pyramid were 32 degrees apart.  The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour, so after 10 hours it moves 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.  So the distance between the sun and the grounds is 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.  The answer is 82. 
32 degrees is the original angle from the ground to the pyramid's entrance.  Since the sun is moving 5 degrees per hour, after 10 hours, it will move 10 * 5 = 50 degrees.  To find the new angle, you add the 50 degrees moved to the 32 degrees already there: 32 + 50 = 82.  The answer is 82. 
 Since the sun starts at the top of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees above the ground, the sun will start at 32 degrees.  It moves upwards 5 degrees an hour.  For 10 hours, it will move 5 * 10 = 50 degrees, adding to the original 32 degrees.  So, the sun will be 32 + 50 = 82 degrees from the ground.  The answer is 82.

Since James wants to buy birthday candles for both sons, he needs a total of 12 + 8 = 20 birthday candles.  
A pack of 5 candles costs $3, so James needs 20 / 5 = 4 packs of candles.  
The cost of 4 packs of candles is 4 x 3 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's first figure out the age of James' younger son.  If the older son is 12 and the younger son is 4 years younger, then the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.  James needs candles for these two sons, so that's a total of 12 + 8 = 20 candles.  Each pack of candles has 5, so James needs 20/5 = 4 packs of candles.  Each pack costs $3, so James needs to pay 4 x 3 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 James has 2 sons.  One son is 12 and the other is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.  He needs candles for both of them.  First, lets find out how many candles he needs.  He needs 12 candles for his 12-year-old son, and 8 candles for his 8-year-old son.  So he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.  A pack of candles costs 3 dollars, and James needs 20/5 = 4 packs.  4 packs will cost 4 x 3 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
 The first son is 12 years old.  The second son is 4 years younger, so the second son is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.  James needed candles for both of them, which makes 12 + 8 = 20 candles.  Since a pack of 5 candles costs 3 dollars, James will need to buy 4 packs (since 4 * 5 = 20).  So the cost will be 4 * 3 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's start by finding the age of James' younger son.  Since the older son is 12, and the younger son is 4 years younger, the younger son is 12 - 4 = 8.  We can now find the total number of candles James needs.  There are 2 sons, so James will need 2 x 10 candles = 20 candles (12 + 8).  Let's find the number of packs of candles James needs to buy.  1 pack has 5 candles, so James will need 20 / 5 = 4 packs.  Since each pack costs $3, James will spend 4 x 3 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 165: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Since Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep, she read for 15 * 7 = 105 minutes in the first week.  In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.  In the first week, she read 2 * 105 / 1. 5 = 140 pages.  In total, she read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.  The answer is 240. 
15 minutes a night, for 7 days, is 15 * 7 = 105 minutes.  The first week, Judy read for 105 minutes.  In 1. 5 minutes, Judy reads 2 pages.  So in 105 minutes, Judy reads 105 / 1. 5 * 2 = 140 pages.  So in the first week, Judy read 140 pages.  In the second week, she read 100 pages.  So in two weeks, Judy read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.  The answer is 240. 
 In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night.  That is a total of 7*15 = 105 minutes.  Since we are told she read 2 pages per 1. 5 minutes, in the first week she read 2*(105/1. 5) = 140 pages. 

In the second week, Judy read 100 pages. 

In total, she read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.  The answer is 240. 
 To solve this problem, we will solve it in steps.  First, let's find out how many minutes Judy read in the second week.  If she read 100 pages, and she reads 2 pages per 1. 5 minutes, then the time in the second week is the amount of pages divided by the number of pages per minute.  100 pages divided by 2 pages per 1. 5 minutes is 50 x 1. 5 minutes.  So in the second week, Judy read 50 x 1. 5 = 75 minutes. 

After that, we know she read 15 minutes each night before going to sleep in the first week.  This means that the first week was 7 nights, and each night she read 15 minutes.  Since 7 x 15 is 105, the first week she read for a total of 105 minutes. 

To find the total minutes she read in two weeks, we add the two together.  The first week she read 105 minutes and the second week she read 75 minutes.  So the total amount of time she read for is 105 + 75 = 180 minutes. 

Finally, we convert this to pages by taking the total minutes and dividing by the number of minutes per page.  Since Judy reads 2 pages per 1. 5 minutes, that is 4 pages per 3 minutes, or 1. 33 pages per minute.  We can multiply 180 minutes by 1. 33 pages per minute to get 240 pages.  The answer is 240.

So, Shiloh's age in 7 years will be 7 + 44 = 51, and his nephew's age will be one-third of that, which is 17.  Since his nephew is 7 years younger than his age in 7 years, his nephew's present age is 17 - 7 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, let's find out Shiloh's age in 7 years.  Since he is 44 years old today, in 7 years, he will be:

44 + 7 = 51 years old

The problem states that in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew.  Let's define the nephew's age as x.  Then, in 7 years, the nephew's age will be:

x + 7

The problem states that Shiloh's age in 7 years will be three times the nephew's age in 7 years, so we can set up the equation:

51 = 3(x + 7)

Simplify the equation:

51 = 3x + 21

Subtract 21 from both sides:

30 = 3x

Divide both sides by 3:

10 = x

So the nephew is 10 years old today. 

The answer is 10.

[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Sharon started with 5 dollars.  She got 1 dollar for each of 3 teeth, so that is 1 x 3 = 3 more dollars.  So now she has 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  Then she got half of 1 dollar for each of 2 teeth.  Half of 1 dollar is 0. 5, and for 2 teeth, that is 0. 5 x 2 = 1 dollar.  So in total, the tooth fairy left Sharon 8 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
 Sharon started with 5 dollars.  Then the tooth fairy gave her 1 dollar for each of 3 teeth, so 3 x 1 = 3 dollars more.  5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  Then the tooth fairy gave her 1/2 the previous amount (1/2 x 1) for each of 2 more teeth, so 2 x (1/2) = 1 dollar more.  8 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9 dollars. 
 Sharon started with $5. 00.  Then, for each of the next 3 teeth, she got $1 each, so that’s $3 more.  $5. 00 + $3. 00 = $8. 00.  For the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount she got for each of the previous three, which is (1/2) * 1 = $0. 50.  So, for the last 2 teeth, she got 2 * $0. 50 = $1. 00.  $8. 00 + $1. 00 = $9. 00.  The answer is 9. 
 The tooth fairy left Sharon $5 initially.  Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1 for each of the next three teeth.  So the tooth fairy gave her 3 x $1 = $3.  In total, Sharon now has $5 + $3 = $8.  For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount as the previous teeth, which is half of $1, or $0. 50.  So for the two teeth, the tooth fairy gave $0. 50 + $0. 50 = $1.  To add this to the total, we have $8 + $1 = $9.  The answer is 9. 
 The tooth fairy started with 5 dollars.  The tooth fairy gave Sharon 1 dollar for each of 3 teeth, so that's 3 more dollars.  5 + 3 = 8.  For the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money for each tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth.  The tooth fairy gave 1 dollar for each of 3 teeth, so she gave Sharon half of that for each of the last 2 teeth.  Half of 1 is 0. 5 dollars, so she gave 0. 5 dollars for each of the last 2 teeth.  The total is 0. 5 + 0. 5 = 1 dollar.  8 + 1 is 9.  The answer is 9. 
25

The tooth fairy left Sharon $5. 00 for the first tooth.  Then, for each of the next 3 teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1. 00.  So, 3 x 1 = 3 dollars.  For the next 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount, which is 1/2 of 1 dollar, which is 0. 50.  For 2 teeth, that is 2 x 0. 5 = 1 dollar.  In total, the tooth fairy left Sharon 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 dollars.  The answer is 9. 

However, the original question asks for the answer in dollars.  So, the answer is 9.

 Richie scored 80 goals.  He scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.  Richie also scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.  In total, the three teenagers scored 60 + 35 + 80 = 175 goals.  The answer is 175. 
80 goals were scored by Richie.  Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.  Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.  In total, they scored 35 + 60 + 80 = 175 goals.  The answer is 175. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Richie scored 80 goals. 
Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals. 

Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. 

In total, the three teenagers scored 80 + 35 + 60 = 175 goals.  The answer is 175. 
 Richie scored 80 goals.  

Anna scored 45 goals less than Richie, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals. 

Mark scored 20 goals less than Richie, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. 

In total, the three teenagers scored 80 + 35 + 60 = 175 goals.  The answer is 175. 
 Let's start by knowing that Richie scored 80 goals.  He scored 20 more goals than Mark, so Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals.  Richie scored 45 more goals than Anna, so Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals.  Adding all the scores, we get 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.  The answer is 175. 
 Richie scored 80 goals.  Let's think about how he compared to his teammates: Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark, and 45 more than Anna.  So Anna scored 80 - 45 = 35 goals and Mark scored 80 - 20 = 60 goals. 

We know how many goals they each scored, so to find how many goals they scored in total, we can just add up their goals: 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.  The answer is 175.

The total number of roses ordered is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.  For the whole month, it is 65 x 4 = 260 roses. 

Ford lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses every month.  The answer is 100. 
 Ford will grow 40 roses every week.  Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he will grow 40 * 4 = 160 roses in a month. 

The total number of roses ordered is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week.  For 4 weeks, the total number of roses needed is 65 * 4 = 260. 

Ford has 160 roses, but needs 260 roses, so he is missing 260 - 160 = 100 roses.  The answer is 100. 
 Ford grows 40 roses every week.  He supplies roses to 3 shops.  The first shop orders 20 roses, the second orders 15 roses, and the third orders 30 roses.  So, he has to supply a total of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. 

He grows 40 roses per week, so in a month, he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses. 

Ford has to supply 65 roses per week to the shops, which is a total of 65 * 4 = 260 roses per month. 

He grows 160 roses, but he needs to supply 260 roses.  So, he lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses.  The answer is 100. 
 Ford grows 40 roses every week, but he must supply 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses to the three flower shops every week.  To find out how many roses he lacks, he grows 40 every week and need 65, so 65 - 40 = 25 roses less every week.  In a month (4 weeks), he lacks 4 x 25 = 100 roses.  The answer is 100. 
 Ford grows 40 roses every week, and we want to find the roses he needs for each shop in a month.  There are 4 weeks in a month.  

The first flower shop orders 20 roses per week, so in a month it would be 20 * 4 = 80 roses.  The second flower shop orders 15 roses per week, so in a month it would be 15 * 4 = 60 roses.  The third flower shop orders 30 roses per week, so in a month it would be 30 * 4 = 120 roses.  

So in total, these flower shops need 80 + 60 + 120 = 260 roses per month.  

Ford grows 40 roses every week, and there are 4 weeks in a month, so he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses per month.  

Ford grows 160 roses per month, but the flower shops need 260 roses per month.  So he lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses per month.  The answer is 100. 
40 roses are grown every week.  In a month, there are 4 weeks.  So in a month, 40 * 4 = 160 roses are grown.  

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second 15 roses, and the third 30 roses per week.  In a week, the total number of roses ordered is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65.  

Every month, 4 weeks are ordered.  So in a month, the total number of roses ordered is 65 * 4 = 260.  

Ford grows 160 roses in a month, but the Rose shops order 260 roses in a month.  So there are 260 - 160 = 100 roses lacking.  The answer is 100. 
1 week, 3 flower shops are ordered total.  20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses are ordered per week.  This means that every week, Ford will leave 65 - 40 = 25 roses unsupplied.  If in a month (4 weeks), there are 25 unsupplied roses per week, then there will be 4 * 25 = 100 roses unsupplied in total.  The answer is 100.

 Katina started with $3000.  She removed $100 each month.  After one year, she would have removed 12 x 100 = 1200 dollars.  So she would have $3000 - $1200 = $1800.  Then, after a second year, she would remove another 12 x 100 = 1200 dollars, leaving her with 1800 - 1200 = 600 dollars.  The answer is 600. 
3000 is the starting amount of money in the account.  She removes 100 dollars every month, so for 2 years she removes 2 x 12 x 100 = 2400 dollars.  So, Katina has 3000 - 2400 = 600 dollars left after 2 years.  The answer is 600. 
 Katina starts with 3000 dollars in the account.  Each month, she removes 100 dollars.  There are 12 months in a year, so in one year she will remove 100 * 12 = 1200.  So, after 1 year, she has 3000 - 1200 = 1800 dollars left.  After another year, she will remove another 1200 dollars, leaving her with 1800 - 1200 = 600 dollars.  The answer is 600. 
1 year will be 12 months.  Within each month, Katina will withdraw 100 dollars.  So she will withdraw 100 x 12 = 1200 dollars in 1 year.  Now, after 2 years, she will have withdrawn a total of 1200 x 2 = 2400 dollars.  Since she started with 3000 dollars, she will have 3000 - 2400 = 600 dollars left.  The answer is 600. 
 Katina starts with 3000 dollars.  At the end of the first year, she will have 3000 - 12 * 100 = 3000 - 1200 = 1800 dollars, since she remove 100 dollars 12 times in a year (twelve months).  At the end of the second year, she will have 1800 - 1200 = 600 dollars, since she again removes 100 dollars 12 times.  The answer is 600.

[EXP] 175: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]:  First, let's calculate the cost of the ingredients.  
The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is 1 loaf * $3. 00 per loaf = $3. 00. 
The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30. 00. 

The total cost is the cost of bread + cost of cheese and condiments = $3. 00 + $30. 00 = $33. 00

The revenue is the price of 10 sandwiches * number of sandwiches = $7. 00 * 10 = $70. 00

The profit is the revenue - the cost = $70. 00 - $33. 00 = $37. 00

The answer is 37. 
 First, we need to calculate the cost per sandwich.  The cost of bread is $3. 00 per loaf and makes 10 sandwiches.  So the cost per sandwich for the bread is $0. 30 (3. 00 / 10).  The cost of cheeses and condiments is $30. 00 for 10 sandwiches.  So the cost per sandwich for the cheeses and condiments is $3. 00 (30. 00 / 10).  The total cost per sandwich is $3. 30 (0. 30 + 3. 00).  

The food truck sells each sandwich for $7. 00.  To find the net profit, we need to subtract the cost per sandwich from the sale price per sandwich.  The net profit is $7. 00 - $3. 30 = $3. 70 per sandwich. 

The food truck sold 10 sandwiches, so the total net profit is $3. 70 x 10 = $37.  The answer is 37. 
 A food truck is selling 10 sandwiches.  Each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so 1 loaf of bread is needed.  The bread costs $3. 00.  The cheese and condiments costs $30. 00 per 10 sandwiches, so it costs $3. 00 per sandwich, or $0. 30 per sandwich.  10 sandwiches cost $30. 00 for the cheese and condiments.  The total cost is 3 + 30 = $33. 00. 

The revenue is 10 x 7 = $70. 00.  The net profit is the revenue minus the cost.  This is 70 - 33 = 37.  The answer is 37.

64 crayons.  Since she wants to make crayon muffins, she melts 8 small pieces of crayons together.  64 ÷ 8 = 8.  But we want the number of crayon muffins she made.  Number of crayons = 64 and number of pieces per muffin = 8.  So, 64 ÷ 8 = 8 muffins.  Kate can sell her 8 muffins for 8 x 1. 50 dollars.  8 x 1. 50 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
3 boxes of 64 crayons, so that's 3 x 64 = 192 crayons.  Kate arranged them in a muffin tin to make 8 muffins.  Each muffin would require 192 ÷ 8 = 24 crayons.  Kate used 24 crayons for each muffin.  Now Kate has 192 - (24 x 8) = 64 crayons left.  We don't need more information to solve this, so we can calculate Kate's earning from the 8 muffins.  8 x 1. 50 is 12.  The answer is 12.

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

The total number of birds Mack saw in 7 days is:
50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280

To find the average number of birds Mack saw per day, we divide the total by the number of days:
280 ÷ 7 = 40

The answer is 40. 
50 + 0 + 120 + 0 + 0 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds in total.  There were 7 days in the period.  To find the average, you calculate 280 divided by 7, which is 40.  The answer is 40. 
7 days in total.  The first 2 days, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.  The next 3 days, 0 + 120 + 20 = 140.  Then on the last day, he saw 90 birds.  So in total, Mack saw 50 + 140 + 90 = 280 birds.  For 7 days, the average is 280 / 7 = 40 birds per day.  The answer is 40. 
50 birds on days 1 and 2.  Then, Mack saw 0 birds on day 3.  On days 4 and 5, Mack saw 120 birds.  On day 6, Mack saw 20 birds.  On day 7, he saw 90 birds.  To find the total number of birds, we add: 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280.  There are 7 days, so we divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average number of birds per day.  280 ÷ 7 = 40.

[EXP] 182: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 215, [output]: 1 hour and 30 minutes is the same as 90 minutes.  2 hours and 5 minutes is the same as 125 minutes.  In total, Max will watch 90 + 125 minutes.  90 + 125 is 215.  The answer is 215. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is the same as 90 minutes.  2 hours and 5 minutes is the same as 125 minutes.  Max has to watch 90 + 125 minutes.  90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 1 * 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  2 hours and 5 minutes is equal to 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.  The total time it takes to watch the two movies is 90 + 125 = 215 minutes.  The answer is 215. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is 90 minutes.  2 hours and 5 minutes is 125 minutes.  In total, Max will watch for 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes.  The answer is 215. 
 The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes, so that is 1 * 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, so that is 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.  The total time to watch the two movies is 90 + 125 minutes, which is 215 minutes.  The answer is 215. 
1 hour and 30 minutes is 1 * 60 + 30 = 90 minutes, and 2 hours and 5 minutes is 2 * 60 + 5 = 125 minutes.  Max will watch 2 movies.  So, 90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
 To find the total number of minutes, we'll convert the time of each movie to just minutes. 

The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes, which is equal to 90 minutes (1 hour = 60 minutes, + 30 minutes). 

The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes, which is equal to 125 minutes (2 hours = 120 minutes, + 5 minutes). 

To find the total number of minutes, we add the time of both movies: 90 + 125 = 215 minutes. 

The answer is 215.

[EXP] 183: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 129200, [output]: 30% less expensive means 70% of the price of Herb's house.  70% of 76,000 = 0. 7 x 76,000 = 53,200.  This is the price of Juan's house.  Now, the combined price of the two houses is 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200.  The answer is 129,200. 
 First, to find the value of Juan's house, since it's 30% less expensive than Herb's, we can find 30% of the cost of Herb's house:

30% of 76,000 = 76,000 x 0. 30 = 22,800

So, Juan's house is 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200. 

Now, to find the value of the two houses combined, we add the values of both houses:

76,000 (Herb's house) + 53,200 (Juan's house) = 129,200

The answer is 129,200. 
30% less than Herb's house is 70% of the house's price, because 100% - 30% = 70%.  Herb's house is worth $76,000.  70% of 76,000 is 53,200.  That is the price of Juan's house.  To find the combined value of the houses, add $76,000 and $53,200.  76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200.  The answer is 129,200. 
 First, we need to find the value of Juan's house.  Since his house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we need to find 30% of Herb's house and subtract that from Herb's house.  

30% of 76,000 is 0. 30 x 76,000 = 22,800.  

Subtract this from the value of Herb's house: 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200. 

Now we know the value of Juan's house: 53,200. 

To find the value of the two houses combined, add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house:

76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200. 

The answer is 129,200.

[EXP] 184: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the number of cups and dishes Judy brought.  She bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups.  She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, so that's 12 x 2 = 24 dishes.  
So, Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes to the event.  Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so that's 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  
To find the total number of utensils, we add Judy's 12 cups and friend's 40 cups, and Judy's 24 dishes and friend's 44 dishes: 
(12 + 40) + (24 + 44) = 52 + 68 = 120

[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 90 contacts will last 45 days.  So he will need 2 boxes which is 2 x 90 = 180 contacts.  The cost of 2 boxes is (2 x 100) - 0. 10 x 200 = 200 - 20 = 180 dollars.  So for each pair of contacts, he will pay 180 / 90 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2 dollars. 
90 contacts in one box will last Pete 45 days.  Since 2 boxes will last Pete for 90 days, he needs 2 boxes. 

The cost of 2 boxes is 2 * 100 = 200.  Since there is 10% off, the actual price is 90% of 200.  90% is 0. 9.  0. 9 * 200 = 180. 

Now, we need to find the cost of a pair of contacts.  There are 90 single use contacts in a box, so each contact costs 180/90 = 2 dollars.

Then he worked 3 times longer than Jill on Sunday, which is 3 x 1 = 3 hours.  So John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours in total.  Jill earned 10 x 3 = 30 dollars.  John earned 10 x 7 = 70 dollars.  To find out how much more John earned, we do 70 - 30 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
 Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked a total of 2 + 1 = 3 hours.   John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 x 2 = 4 hours.  John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 1 x 3 = 3 hours on Sunday.  So in total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.  

Since they both get paid $10 an hour, Jill made 3 x 10 = 30 dollars and John made 7 x 10 = 70 dollars.  To find out how much more money John made compared to Jill, we do 70 - 30 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
 Jill worked 2 hours on saturday and 1 hour on sunday.  So in total she worked 2 + 1 = 3 hours.  John worked twice as long as Jill on saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.  He worked 3 times as long as Jill on sunday, so he worked 1 * 3 = 3 hours.  So in total he worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.  

John will be paid $10 per hour.  So John's earnings are $7 * $10 = $70.  Jill's earnings will be $3 * $10 = $30.  John earned $70 - $30 = $40 more than Jill.  The answer is 40. 
 Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday.  Since John worked twice as long, he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.  On Sunday, Jill worked 1 hour and John worked 3 times as long, so John worked 3 hours.  The total time Jill worked is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.  John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.  Peanut eats 1 dollar per hour.  Jill made 3 * 10 = 30.  John made 7 * 10 = 70.

In total, she burned 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.  Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, she needs 1600 / 200 = 8 times 100 ml.  8 x 100 ml = 800 ml.  The answer is 800. 
 Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns.  She burns 2 * 500 = 1000 calories doing aerobics and 1 * 600 = 600 calories running.  So in total she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.  She needs to drink 1600/200 = 8 times the amount of water.  So 8 * 100 = 800.  The answer is 800. 
 Hannah spent 2 hours doing aerobics, so she burned 2 x 500 = 1000 calories.  She also spent 1 hour running, so she burned 1 x 600 = 600 calories.  In total, she burned 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.  Since she needs 100 ml of water for every 200 calories, we can find how many times 200 calories are in 1600 calories: 1600 / 200 = 8.  Multiply that by 100 ml to get 800 ml.  The answer is 800. 
 Hannah burns 500 calories/hour for 2 hours.  So, that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.  She also burns 600 calories for 1 hour, so that's an additional 600 calories.  In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories. 

For every 200 calories, Hannah needs 100 ml of water.  So, she needs 1600 / 200 = 8 times as much water.  8 x 100 ml = 800 ml.  The answer is 800. 
500 calories for 2 hours is 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.  600 calories for 1 hour is 600 * 1 = 600 calories.  In total, Hannah burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.  For every 200 calories, Hannah needs 100 ml water.  So, to burn 1600 calories, Hannah needs 1600 / 200 = 8 times as much water, which is 8 * 100 = 800 ml of water.  The answer is 800. 
 Hannah burns calories for 2 hours doing aerobics at 500 calories per hour.  2 x 500 = 1000 calories.  She burns calories for 1 hour running at 600 calories per hour which is 600 calories.  She burns a total of 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.  For every 200 calories she has to drink 100 ml of water.  So for 1600 calories she has to drink 1600 / 200 = 8 times 100 ml.

[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Let x be the number of blue jelly beans. 

There are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of red jelly beans is x - x/100 = 0. 99x. 

There are 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so the number of green jelly beans is x + x/100 = 1. 01x. 

The total number of jelly beans is 4500.  We know that the total number of jelly beans is the sum of the red, blue, and green jelly beans, so we can set up the equation:

0. 99x + x + 1. 01x = 4500

Combine like terms:

2. 99x = 4500

Divide both sides by 2. 99:

x = 1500

Now that we know x, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

Number of red jelly beans = 0. 99x = 0. 99(1500) = 1485

And we can find the number of green jelly beans:

Number of green jelly beans = 1. 01x = 1. 01(1500) = 1515

The difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans is:

1515 - 1485 = 30

So, the answer is 30!.

47 is his original typing speed.  It increased to 52 WPM.  After another increase of 5 words, it will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  To find the average, we add the three numbers and divide by 3.  47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Divided by 3 is 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 is the first measurement, then 52 is the second measurement.  If he increases his speed by 5 words, then 52 + 5 = 57 will be the third measurement.  So the three measurements are 47, 52 and 57.  To find the average, add the numbers together and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 words per minute (WPM) was Jared's initial typing speed.  After increasing to 52 WPM, that means an increase of 52 - 47 = 5 words per minute.  If he increases his typing speed again by 5 words, he will have 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  To find the average, we add his three measurements and divide by 3: (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
47 was his starting speed.  Then it increased to 52, which is 52 - 47 = 5 WPM faster.  Then, if he increases his speed by 5 more, it will increase to 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  To find the average of the three measurements, add 47, 52, and 57, then divide by 3.  (47 + 52 + 57) / 3 = 156 / 3 = 52.  The answer is 52.

The answer is 318. 
 Alex started by inviting 100 people.  Each invited person said they would invite 2 friends.  100 x 2 = 200 more people.  So now Alex needs seats for 100 + 200 = 300 people.  She then invited 10 of her own friends, and 8 of them said they will bring their spouses.  10 + 8 = 18 more people.  So total, she needs seats for 300 + 18 = 318 people.  The answer is 318. 
100 people have already been invited via email.  Each invited person will bring 2 friends, so in total, that is 100 + 100 * 2 = 300 people.  Then, Alex's 10 friends invited will also attend, which adds 10 more people.  And since 8 of them are bringing their spouses, that adds 8 more people too.  So the total number of people attending is 300 + 10 + 8 = 318.  The answer is 318. 
 Alex originally made a reservation for 100 people.  This means 100 people will attend.  Each of the 100 people will also bring 2 friends.  So that is 100 * 2 = 200.  In total, there will be 200 more attendees.  Then, Alex calls 10 of her friends to invite them.  8 of those friends say they will bring their spouses.  So that is 8 more people.  10 + 8 = 18 friends are coming.  So, 18 are being added.  200 (from invited friends) + 18 (from called friends) is 218.  And this is added to the 100 people Alex originally invited.  218 + 100 = 318.  The answer is 318.

The answer is 220. 
 Let's start with the weight of the Affenpinscher, which is 10 pounds.  The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 10 x 2 = 20 pounds.  The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 / 4 = 5 pounds.  Finally, the Mastiff weighs 44 times as much as the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 5 x 44 = 220 pounds.  The answer is 220. 
4 dogs are sitting in line: Affenpinscher, Dachshund, Papillon, and Mastiff.  The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds.  The Dachshund weighs twice as much as Affenpinscher, so it weighs 2 * 10 = 20 pounds.  The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so it weighs 1/4 * 20 = 5 pounds.  The Mastiff weighs 44 times as much as the Papillon, so it weighs 44 * 5 = 220 pounds.  The answer is 220. 
 First let's find the weight of each dog and then find the weight of the Mastiff. 

The Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. 

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so it weighs 2 x 10 = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so it weighs 1/4 x 20 = 5 pounds. 

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so it weighs 44 x 5 = 220 pounds. 

The answer is 220. 
 Let's start with the Affenpinscher.  He weighed 10 pounds. 
Next to him sat a Dachshund, who weighed twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighed 2 x 10 = 20 pounds. 
Next to the Dachshund sat a Papillon, who weighed one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighed 20 / 4 = 5 pounds. 
And at the end of the line sat the Mastiff, who weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  So the Mastiff weighed 5 x 44 = 220 pounds. 
The answer is 220. 
 We can solve the problem by working through the dogs one by one.  The Affenpinscher weighed 10 pounds.  The Dachshund weighed twice as much, so 2 x 10 = 20.  The Papillon weighed one-fourth the weight of the Dachshund, so 20/4 = 5.  Finally, the Mastiff weighed 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so 44 x 5 = 220.  The answer is 220.

[EXP] 193: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  On eBay, the boots cost $13.  Shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so shipping costs 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.  13 + 8 is 21 dollars.  The boots cost 16 + 4 = 20 dollars on Amazon.  21 - 20 is 1.  The answer is 1. 
 Let's first calculate the total cost on Amazon: 16 (boots) + 4 (shipping) = 20 dollars. 

On eBay, the boots cost $13.  Shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, which is 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.  So on eBay, the total cost would be 13 (boots) + 8 (shipping) = 21 dollars. 

We want to find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, so we subtract the cost on Amazon from the cost on eBay: 21 (eBay) - 20 (Amazon) = 1 dollar.  The answer is 1. 
16 + 4 = 20, which is the total cost of buying the boots on Amazon.  For eBay, the boots are 13 dollars, but shipping is twice the cost of Amazon, which is 2 x 4 = 8.  So on eBay, the cost is 13 + 8 = 21.  To find out how much more expensive it is to buy on eBay, subtract the cost of Amazon from the cost of eBay: 21 - 20 = 1.  The answer is 1 dollar. 
 The boots cost $16 on Amazon and $4 for shipping.  So on Amazon, the total is $16 + $4 = $20. 

On eBay, the boots cost $13, but shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon.  4 * 2 = 8, so the total shipping on eBay is $8.  The total on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21. 

The boots are more expensive on eBay because the total cost, $21, is greater than the total cost on Amazon, $20.  To find out how much more it is, we take the difference: $21 - $20 = $1.  The answer is 1.

[EXP] 194: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, and the beanstalk is 4 feet tall initially.  So the beanstalk is 4 feet short of the window.  To grow taller than the window, it needs to grow 20 - 4 = 16 feet. 

Each day the beanstalk doubles its height, so it grows 4 feet.  Since it needs to grow 16 feet to reach the window, it will take 16 / 4 = 4 days.  The answer is 4. 
 Mark's beanstalk starts with 4 feet and doubles every day.  So the first day it is 4 feet, the second day it's 8 feet, the third day it's 16 feet.  So for 3 days, the beanstalk will not be taller than the window.  On the 4th day, the beanstalk will be 32 feet and will be taller than the window.  The answer is 4. 
 Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground.  The beanstalk starts out 4 feet tall.  To reach the window, the beanstalk needs to grow 20 - 4 = 16 more feet.  The beanstalk doubles in height each day, so it will take that many days to reach the window.

[EXP] 195: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]: 1 cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein, so each gram of mushrooms has 3/100 = 0. 03 grams of protein.  John eats 200 grams of mushrooms per day, so he eats 0. 03 * 200 = 6. 0 grams of protein per day.  John eats 7 days in a week, so he eats 6. 0 * 7 = 42. 0 grams of protein per week.  The answer is 42. 
 First, find out how many cups of mushrooms John eats in a week.  200 grams / 100 grams/cup = 2 cups of mushrooms in a day.  In a week, John eats 7 days * 2 cups = 14 cups of mushrooms.  Each cup has 3 grams of protein, so 14 cups * 3 grams/cup = 42 grams of protein.  The answer is 42. 
 John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.  So in a week (7 days), he eats 200 x 7 = 1400 grams of mushrooms.  If a cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams, then 1400 grams is 14 cups.  Since each cup has 3 grams of protein, the total protein he consumes per week is 14 x 3 = 42 grams.  The answer is 42. 
100 grams of mushrooms contains 3 grams of protein.  200 grams of mushrooms will be 2 times as much protein, so 3 x 2 = 6 grams of protein.  To get the protein per week, multiply by 7 days in the week.  6 grams of protein per day x 7 days = 42 grams of protein.  The answer is 42. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  The amount of protein per cup of mushrooms is 3 grams. 
2.  Since John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day, we can find out how many cups of mushrooms he eats per day: 200 grams / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups per day. 
3.  Since he eats 2 cups per day, he eats 2 x 3 = 6 grams of protein per day. 
4.  To find out how much protein he gets per week, we multiply the daily amount of protein by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week): 6 grams/day x 7 days/week = 42 grams/week. 

The answer is 42.

[EXP] 196: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be x. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means Jerry was x - 5 years old 5 years ago. 

We know that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplify the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Add 10 to both sides:

x + 10 = 2x

Subtract x from both sides:

10 = x

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's solve it step by step. 

Let Jerry's current age be x. 

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so x = 2(x - 5). 

Simplifying the equation, we get x = 2x - 10. 

Subtracting x from both sides gives us 0 = x - 10. 

Adding 10 to both sides gives us x = 10. 

So Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age: 10 + 3 = 13. 

The answer is 13. 
 Let's start by finding Jerry's current age.  If Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means his current age is twice his age 5 years ago.  Let's call his age 5 years ago x.  Then his current age is 2x. 

We don't know the exact value of x, but we can write an equation to represent this situation:

x + 5 = 2x

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 5

So Jerry was 5 years old 5 years ago and is currently 10 years old. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
 Let's call Jerry's current age "x".  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, that means his age 5 years ago was x/2. 

 His current age is x and his age 5 years ago was x - 5. 

 The equation x = 2(x - 5) can be used to find Jerry's current age. 

 x = 2(x - 5)

 x = 2x - 10

 x + 10 = 2x

10 = x

 Jerry is 10 years old. 

If Jerry is 10 years old, then in 3 years, he will be 13.  The answer is 13.

[EXP] 197: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 260, [output]: 2 implants for $2000 each is 2 x 2000 = 4000 dollars.  For one of the implants, an extra $500 is needed, so 4000 + 500 = 4500.  After subtracting the deposit of 600, he needs 4500 - 600 = 3900.  To earn 3900 at $15 per hour, he needs to work 3900 / 15 = 260 hours.  The answer is 260. 
2 implants will cost 2 x 2000 = 4000 dollars.  One implant needs a crown for 500 dollars, so the total cost is 4000 + 500 = 4500 dollars.  However, he already put down a 600 dollar deposit.  So the remaining amount to pay is 4500 - 600 = 3900 dollars.  He makes 15 dollars per hour, so to find out how many hours he needs to work, we need to divide the remaining amount 3900 by his hourly wage 15. 

3900 / 15 = 260 hours

The answer is 260. 
1.  Determine how much the 2 implants will cost.  1 with porcelain crown: $2000 + $500 = $2500.  1 without porcelain crown: $2000.  2 implants: $2500 + $2000 = $4500.  2.  Subtract the deposit: $4500 - $600 = $3900.  3.  Determine how much George needs to work to earn $3900.  Since he earns $15 per hour, we divide 3900 by 15.  3900 / 15 = 260.  The answer is 260. 
2 implants for $2000 each are $4000.  The porcelain crown has an additional $500 cost, so that is $4500 in total.  After George's $600 deposit, he still needs to pay $3900.  He makes 15 dollars per hour, so he would need to work $3900 / 15 hours = 260 hours.  The answer is 260. 
 First, let's find the total cost of the dental work.  The base price for each implant is $2000, so 2 implants will be 2 x 2000 = 4000.  One of the implants will have a crown, and the crown costs $500, so the total cost of all the implants will be 4000 + 500 = 4500.  Then, he has already put down a deposit of $600, so the total he needs to pay is 4500 - 600 = 3900.  He makes $15 per hour, so to find the number of hours he needs to work, we divide the amount he needs by the hourly wage: 3900 / 15 = 260.  The answer is 260. 
4 implants, in total, but one is only going to cost 2000 plus 500 = 2500.  So the total cost is 2500 + 2000 = 4500.  We subtract the deposit of 600, so 4500 - 600 = 3900.  We have 3900 left to pay off.  If George makes 15 dollars per hour, how many hours does he need to work to earn 3900? We do 3900 / 15 = 260 hours.  The answer is 260.

[EXP] 198: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Let the smallest angle be x.  Then one angle is 2x and the other is 3x. 

The sum of the three angles is 180 degrees.  So, we can write an equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

The smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The other two angles are 2x = 60 and 3x = 90.  The largest angle is 90 degrees. 

The answer is 90. 
 Let x be the smallest angle.  Since one angle is twice the smallest angle, that angle is 2x.  Since one angle is three times the smallest angle, that angle is 3x.  The three angles add up to 180 degrees.  

x + 2x + 3x = 180

Combine the like terms:

6x = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 30

So the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The angles that are twice and three times the smallest angle are 60 and 90 degrees respectively.  The largest angle is 90 degrees.  The answer is 90. 
 Let's say the smallest angle is x.  The other two angles are 2x and 3x.  So, the sum of the three angles is x + 2x + 3x = 180.  We can combine like terms to get 6x = 180.  To find the value of x, we can divide both sides by 6, getting x = 30.  The largest angle is 3x = 3*30 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
 There are three angles in the triangle.  One angle is twice the smallest, and one angle is three times the smallest.  Let's think of the smallest angle as x.  The other two angles are 2x and 3x.  The sum of the three angles is 180, so we set up an equation: x + 2x + 3x = 180.  Simplify the equation by combining like terms: 6x = 180.  Divide both sides by 6 to solve for x: x = 30.  So the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The other angles are 2x = 2(30) = 60 and 3x = 3(30) = 90.  The largest angle is 90 degrees.  The answer is 90.

So in total, Colby has 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.  Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is 5 cents, we can divide 345 cents by 5 cents to get the number of gumballs Colby can buy.  345 / 5 = 69.  The answer is 69. 
8 quarters is 8 * (25 cents) = 200 cents.  6 dimes is 6 * (10 cents) = 60 cents.  14 nickels is 14 * (5 cents) = 70 cents.  15 pennies is 15 * (1 cent) = 15 cents.  So in total, he has 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 cents.  Each gumball costs 5 cents, so he can buy 345 / 5 = 69 gumballs.  The answer is 69. 
8 quarters = 2 dollars (since each quarter is 25 cents, 8 quarters is 8 x 25 = 200 cents / 100 cents = 2 dollars)
6 dimes = 60 cents
14 nickels = 70 cents (since each nickel is 5 cents, 14 nickels is 14 x 5 = 70 cents)
15 pennies = 15 cents

Adding all of Colby's money, 2 dollars + 0. 60 dollars + 0. 70 dollars + 0. 15 dollars = 3. 45 dollars. 

Since each gumball costs a nickel, which is 5 cents, we can divide 345 cents (3. 45 dollars) by 5 cents to find out how many gumballs Colby can buy.  345 / 5 = 69.

8 pounds plus 50% of 8 pounds is 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.  Then he used 12 pounds minus 2 pounds.  12 - 2 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
8-pound weight.  Jamaal increases the weight by 50%, so the new weight is 1. 5 times 8, which is 12.  Since it's too heavy, he uses 12 - 2 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
50% of 8 is 4.  So the increased weight is 8 + 4 = 12.  Since Jamal now uses a weight 2 pounds less than that, he uses 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.  The answer is 10. 
8 pounds is the original weight Jamaal used.  He increased it by 50%, which is 0. 5 * 8 = 4 pounds.  So now he's using 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.  But since this is too heavy, he uses 2 pounds lighter, which is 12 - 2 = 10 pounds.  The answer is 10. 
8-pound is the initial weight.  50% of 8 is (8 x 0. 5) = 4.  So Jamaal increases the weight to 8 + 4 = 12 pounds.  Since it is too heavy, he switches to a weight that is 2 pounds lighter.  12 - 2 = 10.  The answer is 10.

[EXP] 207: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month.  The number of times the tire rotates per month is 400 * 725 = 290000.  Now, each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, so we need to divide 10,440,000 by 290000 to find the number of months it can be used.  10,440,000 / 290000 is 36.  Since Jeremy drives 400 miles a month, we need to divide 36 by 12 to convert months to years.  36 / 12 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
 Jeremy tires rotate 725 times every 2 miles.  Then he drives 400 miles a month.  So the tires rotate 725 x (400/2) = 145,000 times a month.  Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations so 10,440,000 / 145,000 = 72 months to replace one tire.  A month is about a quarter of a year so 72 months is 3 years.  The answer is 3.

But, there is a 30% off sale, so the actual cost will be 60 - 0. 30 * 60 = 60 - 18 = 42 dollars.  Joe will spend 42 dollars, and will have 50 - 42 = 8 dollars left.  The answer is 8. 
 Joe starts with 50 dollars.  The shirt is 25 dollars and the shorts are 35 dollars, for a total of 25 + 35 = 60 dollars.  The sale is 30%, so Joe will pay 30% less than the total, and the discount is 0. 3 x 60 = 18.  So Joe will pay 60 - 18 = 42 dollars.  Joe has 50 - 42 = 8 dollars left.  The answer is 8.

[EXP] 210: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 4 dozen croissants a day for a week is 4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants.  For 1 dozen croissants, it takes 1/4 pound of butter.  For 28 dozen croissants, it would be 28 * (1/4) = 7 pounds of butter.  The answer is 7. 
4 dozen croissants will require 1/4 * 4 = 1 pound of butter.  He wants to make 4 dozen croissants per day for 7 days, so 1 * 7 = 7 pounds of butter.  The answer is 7. 
1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants.  To make 4 dozen croissants, 4 x 1/4 pound = 1 pound of butter.  For 7 days, Juan needs 1 x 7 = 7 pounds of butter.  The answer is 7. 
1/4 pound of butter makes 1 dozen croissants.  So 1 pound of butter makes 4 dozen croissants, or 48 croissants.  He wants to make 4 dozen croissants a day for 7 days, which is a total of 4 * 7 = 28 dozen croissants.  Since 1 pound of butter makes 48 croissants and he needs 28 * 12 = 336 croissants, he will need 336 / 48 = 7 pounds of butter.  The answer is 7. 
1/4 pound of butter is needed to make 1 dozen croissants, which is equal to 12 croissants.  To make 4 dozen, or 4 * 12 = 48 croissants, Juan will need 4 times as much butter, which is 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound.  Since he will be making this many croissants for a week, which is 7 days, he will need 7 times as much butter, which is 7 * 1 = 7 pounds.  The answer is 7. 
1 dozen croissants require 1/4 pound of butter.  Juan will make 4 dozen of croissants per day, so 4 x 1/4 = 1 pound of butter per day.  Since he will make croissants for 7 days, 1 pound per day x 7 days = 7 pounds of butter.  The answer is 7.

 The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.  The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  That is 8 ounces of meat.  The third player ate a one-pound steak.  1 pound = 16 ounces.  So the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.  To find the total, we add the ounces of meat: 6 + 8 + 16 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
6 ounces were eaten by the first player, and each of the 8 beef tips eaten by the second player were 1 ounce, so that's 8 ounces.  The third player ate a 1-pound steak, which is 16 ounces.  To find the total ounces of meat consumed, add 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.  The answer is 30. 
6 ounces of steak were eaten by the first player.  8 beef tips, each an ounce in size, were eaten by the second player.  1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, so 16 ounces of meat were eaten by the third player.  In total, that is 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat eaten by the first 3 players.  The last 2 players ate vegetarian meals, so no meat was consumed by them.  The answer is 30. 
 The basketball team consists of a first, second, third, fourth, and fifth player.  First player ate a 6-ounce steak.  Second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.  So second player ate 8 ounces.  Third player ate 1-pound steak, which is 16 ounces.   So 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces.

[EXP] 215: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 312, [output]:  Gary does laundry 2 times a week, that's a total of 2 * 52 = 104 loads a year.  For each load, 20 gallons of water are used.  A gallon of water costs 0. 15$.  So for one load, the cost is 20 * 0. 15 = 3 dollars.  For 104 loads, the total cost is 3 * 104 = 312 dollars.  The answer is 312. 
 First, let's figure out how much water Gary uses in a week.  Gary does laundry twice a week, and each load uses 20 gallons.  So, 2 loads per week * 20 gallons per load = 40 gallons per week.  

Now, let's figure out how much water Gary uses in a year.  There are 52 weeks in a year.  So, 40 gallons/week * 52 weeks is 2080 gallons.  

Now, let's figure out how much Gary spends on water for laundry in a year.  If it costs 0. 15 dollars per gallon, then 2080 gallons would be 0. 15 * 2080 = 312 dollars.  The answer is 312.

[EXP] 218: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour.  He works 10 hours a day, so he sells 10 x 15 = 150kg of meat a day.  He gets a bull that weighs 750kg.  So it will take him 750/150 days to sell the meat.  750 divided by 150 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
750 kg of meat was given to Prince.  Prince sells 15 kg of meat per hour.  He works 10 hours a day.  So he sells 15 x 10 = 150 kg of meat per day.  To find out how many days it would take to sell the 750 kg of meat, we need to divide 750 kg by 150 kg.  

750 ÷ 150 = 5

The answer is 5 days. 
 Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.  He works 10 hours a day.  So he sells 15 x 10 = 150 kg of meat every day. 

Using Bill's bull, Prince has a total of 750 kg of meat. 

To find out how many days it will take him to sell all the meat, divide the total amount of meat by the amount of meat he sells per day:

750 kg / 150 kg/day = 5 days

The answer is 5. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

First, Prince sells 15kg of meat every hour, and he works 10 hours a day, so he sells a total of 15 x 10 = 150kg of meat per day. 

He has a bull that weighs 750kg, and he sells 150kg every day.  To find out how many days it will take him to sell the meat from the bull, we need to divide the weight of the bull (750kg) by the amount he sells per day (150kg). 

So, 750 ÷ 150 = 5 days.

So 18 seats were occupied by the administrators.  72 - 18 = 54.  One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.  1/3 of 54 is 18.  So 18 seats were occupied by the parents.  54 - 18 = 36.  The rest of the seats, 36, were occupied by the students.  The answer is 36. 
4 rows of seats, each with 18 seats, means there are 4 x 18 = 72 seats in total. 
One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, which is 72 / 4 = 18. 
Now, there are 72 - 18 = 54 seats left. 
One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, which is 54 / 3 = 18. 
Now, there are 54 - 18 = 36 seats left for the students. 
The answer is 36. 
4 x 18 = 72, so there are 72 seats in total.  One-fourth of the seats are occupied by the administrators, which is 72 / 4 = 18.  So, there are 72 - 18 = 54 seats remaining.  One-third of the remaining seats are occupied by the parents and the rest by students.  One-third of 54 is 54 / 3 = 18.  So, 18 seats are occupied by the parents and 54 - 18 = 36 seats are occupied by the students.  The answer is 36. 
 Let's first find the total number of seats in the auditorium: 4 rows x 18 seats/row = 72 seats. 

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators.  72 / 4 = 18, so 18 seats were occupied by the administrators.  

This leaves 72 - 18 = 54 seats remaining. 

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents.  54 / 3 = 18, so 18 seats were occupied by the parents. 

The remaining seats were occupied by the students.  54 - 18 = 36, so there were 36 seats occupied by the students. 

The answer is 36. 
4 rows * 18 seats = 72 seats total.  One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, so 72 / 4 = 18 seats were occupied by administrators.  72 - 18 = 54 seats left.  One-third of those seats were occupied by parents, so 54 / 3 = 18 seats.  So 54 - 18 = 36 seats were left for students.  The answer is 36. 
4 rows with 18 seats each means there are 18 * 4 = 72 seats in total.  One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators, which is 72 * 0. 25 = 18 seats.  72 - 18 = 54 seats are left.  One-third of those seats are occupied by parents, which is 54 * 0. 33 = 18.  54 - 18 = 36 seats are left, which are occupied by students.  The answer is 36. 
4 rows of seats and 18 seats in each row, there are 4 * 18 = 72 seats in total.  One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so 72/4 = 18 seats were occupied by the administrators.  So 72 - 18 = 54 seats were remaining.  One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest were occupied by the students.  One-third of 54 is 54/3 = 18, which is the number of seats occupied by the parents.  So the number of seats occupied by the students is 54 - 18 = 36.  The answer is 36. 
1/4 of the seats were occupied by the administrators.  There are a total of 4 rows of 18 seats each, so there are 4 * 18 = 72 seats.  1/4 of 72 is 18, so 18 seats were occupied by the administrators.  Now, there are 72 - 18 = 54 seats left.  1/3 of these remaining seats were occupied by the parents and the rest by the students.  1/3 of 54 is 18, so 18 seats were occupied by the parents.

 John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.  Each week, he went 2 times, for 2 hours each, so he went a total of 2 x 2 = 4 times per week.  So, in total, he went 4 x 6 = 24 times.  Each session costs $125.  So, in total, he spent 24 x 125 = 3000 dollars.  The answer is 3000. 
 If John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, and each week he went twice for 2 hours at a time, then that is 2 x 2 = 4 sessions per week.  4 sessions for 6 weeks means 4 x 6 = 24 sessions in total.  Since each session costs $125 per hour, the total cost will be 24 x 125 = 3000 dollars.  The answer is 3000. 
6 weeks means John had physical therapy for 6 x 2 = 12 times.  Each session cost 2 hours and $125 per hour.  So for one session, that's 2 x 125 = 250 dollars.  That would be for 12 sessions.  12 x 250 = 3000.  The answer is 3000.

 Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.  Over 8 hours at school, he will chew 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum.  He also chews 1 on the way home and 1 after dinner, for a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6.  So he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces left.  Then he gives his sister half the remaining gum.  Half of 14 is 7, so he gives her 7 sticks.  That leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.  The answer is 7. 
 Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.  For every 2 hours he's at school, he chews 1 piece of gum.  8 hours at school means he chews 8 / 2 = 4 pieces of gum.  4 + 1 for the way home and 1 for after dinner is 6 pieces of gum.  20 - 6 is 14 gum pieces left.  He gives away half the remaining gum to his sister, so he gives away 14 / 2 = 7 gum pieces.  14 - 7 = 7 gum pieces.  The answer is 7. 
 Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.  Jim has school for 8 hours.  He chews a piece of gum for every 2 hours he's at school, so he chews 4 pieces at school.  He also chews 1 piece of gum on the way home and 1 piece after dinner, so he chews a total of 6 pieces.  20 - 6 = 14.  So Jim has 14 pieces of gum left.  He gives half of it to his sister, which is 14 / 2 = 7 pieces.  So he is left with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.  The answer is 7. 
 Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Jim has a 20-pack of gum initially.  He chews 1 piece every 2 hours during school, which means he chews 4 pieces (8 hours / 2 hours per piece).  Then, he chews 2 more pieces - 1 on the way home and 1 after dinner, for a total of 6 pieces of gum. 

Jim has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left after chewing.  Then, he gives half the remaining gum to his sister, which is half of 14, or 7 pieces. 

So, Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day. 

The answer is 7. 
 Jim started with 20 packs of gum.   First, he chews 1 piece of gum for every 2 hours he is at school for a school day of 8 hours.   8 / 2 is 4, so he chews 4 pieces of gum.   On the way home he chews 1 more and after dinner he chews 1 more, so 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum.   He also gives half of the gum he has left to his sister.   20 - 6 = 14 gum left.   Then he gives his sister 14 / 2 = 7 gum sticks.   He is left with 14 - 7 gum sticks.   14 - 7 is 7.  The answer is 7.

9 baseballs for 3 dollars each will be 9 x 3 = 27 dollars.  8 basketballs for 14 dollars each will be 8 x 14 = 112 dollars.  To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, subtract the baseball coach's amount from the basketball coach's amount: 112 - 27 = 85.  The answer is 85. 
 The baseball coach spent 9 * 3 = 27 dollars on baseballs.  The basketball coach spent 8 * 14 = 112 dollars on basketballs.  To find out how much more the basketball coach spent, we subtract 27 from 112.  112 - 27 is 85.  The answer is 85. 
 The baseball coach bought 9 new baseballs for $3 each.  So the total cost was 9 x 3 = 27 dollars.  The basketball coach bought 8 new basketballs for $14 each.  So the total cost was 8 x 14 = 112 dollars.  The basketball coach spent 112 - 27 dollars more than the baseball coach.  112 - 27 is 85.  The answer is 85. 
 The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each.  So he spent 9 x 3 = 27. 

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each.  So he spent 8 x 14 = 112. 

To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent: 112 - 27 = 85. 

The answer is 85. 
 The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for 3 dollars each.  So the baseball coach spent 9 * 3 = 27 dollars. 
The basketball coach spent 8 * 14 = 112 dollars. 
112 - 27 is 85.  The basketball coach spent 85 dollars more than the baseball coach.  The answer is 85.

[EXP] 226: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]: 10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row means there are 10 x 20 = 200 flowers in total.  If only 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed, that means the number of bloomed flowers is 4/5 * 200 = 160.  The answer is 160. 
10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row means there are a total of 10 x 20 = 200 flowers.  4/5 of the flowers have bloomed.  So 200 * (4/5) = 160 flowers have bloomed.  The answer is 160. 
10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers each will be 10 x 20 = 200 flowers.  4/5 of the flowers have bloomed.  So 4/5 of 200 flowers have bloomed, which is 4/5 x 200 = 160.  The answer is 160. 
10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row means a total of 10 x 20 = 200 flowers.  Only 4/5 have bloomed, so the number of bloomed flowers can be found by multiplying 200 by 4/5, which is 200 * (4/5) = 160.  The answer is 160. 
10 rows of flowers, with 20 flowers in each row, means there are 10 x 20 = 200 flowers total.  If only 4/5 have bloomed, we need to find 4/5 of 200.  To do this, we can multiply 200 by 4/5. 

200 x 4 = 800
800 ÷ 5 = 160

So, 160 flowers have bloomed.  The answer is 160. 
10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers each means there are 10 x 20 = 200 flowers.  Now, only 4/5 of them have bloomed.  We can convert 4/5 to a decimal by dividing the numerator by the denominator, so 4/5 is the same as 0. 8.  Multiply 0. 8 by 200 to get the number of bloomed flowers: 200 x 0. 8 = 160.  The answer is 160. 
10 rows of flowers with 20 flowers in each row is a total of 10 x 20 = 200 flowers.  If only 4/5 have bloomed, then the number of flowers that have bloomed is 4/5 x 200.  To make this easier, convert the fraction to a decimal by dividing 4 by 5, which is 0. 8.  Then multiply 0. 8 by 200, which is 160.  The answer is 160.

[EXP] 227: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]: 20kb is the speed per second.  To find the speed per minute, multiply by 60: 20kb x 60 = 1200kb.  To find the speed per hour, multiply by 60 again: 1200kb x 60 = 72000kb. 

Since there are 1000kb in 1Mb, we can divide 72000kb by 1000 to get the speed in Mb: 72000/1000 = 72Mb. 

The answer is 72Mb per hour. 
1 Mb is 1000 kb, so 20 kb = 20/1000 Mb.  This is 0. 02 Mb.  Per second.  There are 3600 seconds in 1 hour.  So per hour, Ashley's internet connection speed would be 0. 02 Mb * 3600 seconds.  This is 72 Mb.  The answer is 72. 
 Ashley starts with an internet connection speed of 20kb per second.  There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so her speed in kb per minute would be 20 x 60 = 1200.   There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so her speed in kb per hour would be 1200 x 60 = 72000.  As stated in the problem, 1 Mb has 1000 kb.  So to find her speed in Mb per hour, we can divide 72000 by 1000.  72000 / 1000 = 72.  The answer is 72. 
1 Mb is equal to 1000 kb.  Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second.  So we need to convert her speed to Mb.  To do this, we need to divide 20 kb by 1000, which is 0. 02.  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we need to multiply 0. 02 by 60 to get the speed in Mb per minute.  0. 02 x 60 = 1. 2 Mb per minute.  Finally, there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 1. 2 Mb per minute by 60 to get 72 Mb per hour.  The answer is 72 Mb per hour. 
20 kb per second

Convertingalebases: 1 Mb = 1000 kb

So Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb is:
20 kb / second = 0. 02 Mb / second

Now, we need to convert seconds to hours:
1 hour = 60 minutes
1 minute = 60 seconds
So, 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds

Ashley's internet connection speed in Mb per hour:
0. 02 Mb/second * 3600 seconds/hour = 72 Mb/hour

The answer is 72.

[EXP] 228: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 54, [output]: 10 cars were towed each of the first 3 days, so that is 3 x 10 = 30 cars.  4 fewer cars were towed on each of the remaining 4 days.  That is 4 x 6 = 24 cars.  30 + 24 = 54.  The answer is 54. 
10 cars per day for 3 days is 10 * 3 = 30 cars.  For the remaining 4 days, 4 fewer cars were pulled per day, so 10 - 4 = 6 cars were pulled each day.  For 4 days, that's 4 * 6 = 24 cars.  Then, the total cars pulled that week is 30 + 24 = 54.  The answer is 54. 
10 cars per day for the first three days means the tow truck pulled 10 x 3 = 30 cars during those days.  Since the tow truck pulled 4 fewer cars for the remaining days, that means it pulled 6 cars on each of those days.  6 x 4 = 24 cars.  The total number of cars the tow truck towed is 30 + 24 = 54.  The answer is 54. 
10 cars were towed each day for the first 3 days.  So the total for these 3 days is 10 x 3 = 30 cars.  The remaining days are 4 days, and they pulled 4 fewer cars than the first 3 days.  So they pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars each day for the remaining days.  For these 4 days, the total is 6 x 4 = 24 cars.  In total, the total number of cars towed is 30 + 24 = 54 cars.  The answer is 54. 
 The tow truck pulled 10 cars each for 3 days.  That is 10 x 3 = 30 cars.  Then it pulled 10 - 4 = 6 cars each day for the remaining days.  The remaining days are 4 days because there are 7 days in a week and it pulled cars each of the first 3 days.  So it pulled 6 cars each for 4 days.  4 days times 6 cars each day is 6 x 4 = 24 cars.  The total number of cars is 30 + 24 = 54.  The answer is 54.

[EXP] 229: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.  Adam is currently 40 inches, so he needs to grow 48 - 40 = 8 inches.  He grows 2 inches a year, so it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 years to reach the required height.  The answer is 4 years. 
40 inches is 40 / 12 = 3. 33 feet.  To be tall enough to ride the roller coaster, Adam needs to be 4 feet.  So, he needs to grow 4 - 3. 33 = 0. 67 feet.  If he grows 2 inches a year, then he needs to grow 2 / 12 = 0. 17 feet per year.  To find how many years it will take him to grow 0. 67 feet, we can divide 0. 67 by 0. 17, which gives us 4 years.  The answer is 4. 
 We need to know how many inches tall you need to be.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so you need to be at least 4 x 12 = 48 inches tall.  So the difference between Adam's current height and the minimum height to ride the roller coaster is 48 - 40 = 8 inches.  Since he grows 2 inches a year, it will take him 8/2 = 4 years to grow tall enough to ride the roller coaster.  The answer is 4.

[EXP] 231: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 25% of 100 is 0. 25 x 100 = 25.  These are the total number of surfers who can stay upright.  Since 60% of these are women, 100% - 60% = 40% of the surfers are men.  40% of 25 is 0. 4 x 25 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
25% of riders can stay upright.  25% of 100 is 100 * 0. 25 = 25.  Of these riders, 60% are women.  60% of 25 is 25 * 0. 6 = 15.  So there are 15 women.  The remaining ones are men.  There are 25 - 15 = 10 men.  The answer is 10. 
100 surfers riding a wave.  25% can stay upright, so 0. 25 * 100 = 25 surfers.  Of these 25 surfers, 60% are women, so 0. 6 * 25 = 15 are women.  The rest are men.  25 - 15 = 10 men.  The answer is 10. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

There are 100 riders initially. 

25% (or 1/4) of the riders can stay upright.  So the number of riders who can stay upright is:

100 * 1/4 = 25

These 25 riders are 60% women, so the number of women is:

25 * 60/100 = 15

To find the number of men, subtract the number of women from the total number of riders who can stay upright:

25 - 15 = 10

So, 10 men can stay upright on the wave. 

The answer is 10. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Step 1: Find out how many riders can stay upright on the wave.  Since it's a 25% chance, take 100 x 0. 25 = 25. 

Step 2: Find out how many of these 25 riders are women.  Since 60% of them are women, take 25 x 0. 6 = 15. 

Step 3: Now find out how many men can stay upright on the wave.  Since there are a total of 25 riders and 15 are women, the remaining 25 - 15 = 10 must be men. 

The answer is 10. 
100 riders are initially.  After only 25% of riders can stay upright, we can find the total number of riders staying upright:

25% = 0. 25
Number of riders staying upright = 100 x 0. 25 = 25

Of these riders, 60% are women.  So, 60% of 25 or 0. 6 x 25 = 15 are women. 

To find the number of men, we subtract the number of women from the total number of riders staying upright:

Number of men = Number of riders staying upright - Number of women
= 25 - 15
= 10

The answer is 10.

[EXP] 232: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4800, [output]:  First, let's find the price of a gold Jewell.  If the price of a diamond Jewell is 2000 dollars, and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times that, then the price of gold is (4/5)*2000 = 1600 dollars.  

Next, let's find the price of a silver Jewell.  The cost of a silver Jewell is 400 dollars less than the gold Jewell, so the price of silver is 1600 - 400 = 1200 dollars.  

Now let's add the price of all three Jewells.  The price of the diamond is 2000 dollars, the price of the gold is 1600 dollars, and the price of the silver is 1200 dollars.  2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800.  The answer is 4800. 
 First, let's find the cost of each jewel.  Diamond is 2000 dollars.  Gold is 4/5 times the cost of the diamond.  To find that, we do 2000 * 4/5 = 1600.  The cost of gold is 1600 dollars.  Silver is 400 dollars less than the cost of gold.  To find the cost of silver, we do 1600 - 400 = 1200.  The cost of silver is 1200 dollars.  Now we know the cost of all three jewells, so we add them up.  2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800.  The answer is 4800. 
1st, we find the price of a gold Jewell.  If the price of a diamond Jewell is $2000 and the price of a gold Jewell is 4/5 times as much, then we multiply the price of a diamond Jewell by 4/5 to find the price of a gold Jewell. 
The price of a diamond Jewell is 2000. 
The price of a gold Jewell is (4/5) x 2000 = 1600. 

2nd, we find the price of a silver Jewell.  The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of a gold.  The price of a gold Jewell is 1600.  Then the price of a silver Jewell is 1600 - 400 = 1200. 

The total price for all three jewels is: the price of a diamond + the price of a gold + the price of a silver. 
The price of a diamond is 2000.  The price of a gold is 1600.  The price of a silver is 1200.  2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800. 
The answer is 4800.

If they work all 7 days of the week, then they process 100 + 50 = 150 customers per day.  For the whole week, they will process 7 x 150 = 1050 customers.  The answer is 1050. 
 Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel, so Julie processes 2 x 50 = 100 customers per day.  Since they work all 7 days of the week, their total weekly production will be 7 days x 100 customers/day = 700 for Julie, and 7 days x 50 customers/day = 350 for Jewel.  So the total weekly production is 700 + 350 = 1050.  The answer is 1050. 
 Jewels processes 50 customers per day.  If Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewels, then Julie processes 50 x 2 = 100 customers per day.  For the entire week, Jewels will process 50 x 7 = 350 customers.  Julie will also process 100 x 7 = 700 customers.  So together they process 350 + 700 = 1050 customers.  The answer is 1050. 
 To figure this out, we need to find out how many customers Julie processes in a day.  If Jewel processes 50 customers a day and Julie operates exactly twice as fast, then Julie will process 50 x 2 = 100 customers a day.  In a week, they will work 7 days.  So Julie will process 100 x 7 = 700 customers in a week.  Jewel will also process 50 x 7 = 350 customers in a week.  In total, they will process 350 + 700 = 1050 customers in a week.  The answer is 1050. 
 <br>
Jewel operates the cash register for 50 customers per day.   Since Julie operates it exactly twice as fast as Jewel, Julie operates it for 50 * 2 = 100 customers per day.   Together, they operate the register for a total of 100 + 50 = 150 customers per day.   They work all 7 days of the week, so in total this is 7 * 150 = 1050 customers.  The answer is 1050. 
50 customers processed by Julie's colleague Jewel in a single day.  Since Julie operates exactly 2 times as fast as Jewel, Julie processes 2 times 50 customers which is 100 customers in a single day.  To calculate the total weekly production, we need to multiply the daily production by the number of days in a week which is 7.  For Jewel, the weekly production is 50 customers per day multiplied by 7 days which is 50 x 7 = 350 customers.  For Julie, the weekly production is 100 customers per day multiplied by 7 days which is 100 x 7 = 700 customers.  In total, they process 350 + 700 = 1050 customers in a week.  The answer is 1050.

4 apples cost $5. 20, so the cost of 1 apple is 5. 20/4 = 1. 30.  For 5 apples, the cost is 5 * 1. 30 = 6. 50. 

3 oranges cost $3. 30, so the cost of 1 orange is 3. 30/3 = 1. 10.  For 5 oranges, the cost is 5 * 1. 10 = 5. 50. 

In total, Clyde will pay 6. 50 + 5. 50 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
4 apples for 5. 20 dollars means 5 apples for 5. 20 * 5/4 = 6. 50 dollars.  3 oranges for 3. 30 dollars means 5 oranges for 3. 30 * 5/3 = 5. 50 dollars.  The cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges is 6. 50 + 5. 50 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
4 apples for 5. 20 dollars means that each apple costs 5. 20 / 4 = 1. 30 dollars.  5 apples will then cost 5 x 1. 30 = 6. 50 dollars. 

For 3 oranges, it costs 3. 30 dollars, so each orange costs 3. 30 / 3 = 1. 10 dollars.  5 oranges will cost 5 x 1. 10 = 5. 50 dollars. 

In total, Clyde will pay 6. 50 + 5. 50 = 12. 00 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
4 apples cost $5. 20 so the price of 1 apple is 5. 20 / 4 = $1. 30 per apple.  5 apples would be 5 x 1. 30 = $6. 50.  3 oranges cost $3. 30 so the price of 1 orange is $1. 10.  5 oranges would be 5 x 1. 10 = $5. 50.  To find the total, we add 6. 50 + 5. 50 = 12.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 240: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 216, [output]: 6 feet * 4 feet * 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.  72 * 3 seconds = 216 seconds.  The answer is 216. 
6 feet * 4 feet * 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.  For each 1 cubic foot, it takes Bob 3 seconds.  So for 72 cubic feet, it will take Bob 72 * 3 seconds.  72 * 3 is 216.  The answer is 216. 
6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet is the volume of the hole.  This is 6 * 4 * 3 = 72 cubic feet.  It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel one cubic foot.  So it will take him 3 * 72 = 216 seconds to shovel the whole hole.  The answer is 216 seconds. 
6 by 4 by 3 is a rectangular prism with volume = 6 * 4 * 3 = 72 cubic feet.  Bob shovels a cubic foot in 3 seconds, so for the entire hole, it will take him 72 * 3 = 216 seconds to dig the hole.  The answer is 216. 
 We need to find the volume of the hole first.  The formula to find the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height.  So, the volume is 6 x 4 x 3 = 72 cubic feet.  Since it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, he we need to multiply the volume by 3: 72 x 3 = 216 seconds.  The answer is 216. 
1.  First, we need to figure out how many cubic feet of earth the hole will contain.  Since the hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep, we multiply 6 * 4 * 3 = 72.  That means Bob needs to dig 72 cubic feet of earth.  2.  It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth.  Since he needs to shovel 72 cubic feet, we multiply 72 * 3 = 216 seconds.  The answer is 216.

[EXP] 241: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 43,500, [output]:  The base cost of the truck is $30,000.  The king cab upgrade costs $7,500, so the total cost is 30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500.  Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so they cost 1/3 x 7,500 = 2,500.  Running boards are $500 less than leather seats, so they cost 2,500 - 500 = 2,000.  The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.  The total extra cost is 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 13,500.  The total cost of the truck is the base cost plus the extra cost.  37,500 + 13,500 = 51,000.  The answer is 51,000.

[EXP] 242: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 262500, [output]: 5% of 20000 is 5/100 * 20000 = 1000.  So Tim's raise is 1000.  His salary goes from 20000 to 20000 + 1000 = 21000.  The bonus is half of 20000, which is 20000/2 = 10000.  So Tim's total income is 21000 + 10000 = 31000.  How much does he make in a year? There are 12 months in a year, and Tim's monthly income is 31000.  So his annual income is 12 * 31000 = 372000.  The answer is 372000.

[EXP] 243: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 10,800, [output]:  James bought 10 suits for 750 dollars each.  So that is 10 x 750 = 7500 dollars.  He also bought 10 dress pants for 1/5 the cost of a suit.  So that is 10 x (750/5) = 1500.  Finally, he bought 3 dress shirts per suit for 60 dollars each.  3 x 10 = 30 dress shirts.  So 30 x 60 = 1800.  The total cost is 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800.  The answer is 10800 dollars. 
 James started with a cost of 10 suits for 750 dollars each.  That is 10 x 750 = 7500 dollars.  The dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of the suits, or 750 / 5 = 150 each.  He bought 10 dress pants, so that is 150 x 10 = 1500 dollars.  He also bought 3 dress shirts for each of the 10 suits, so that is 10 x 3 = 30 dress shirts.  Each dress shirt cost 60 dollars, so that is 60 x 30 = 1800 dollars.  The total cost is 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800.  The answer is 10800. 
 First, the cost of suits: 10 suits at 750 dollars each will be 10 x 750 = 7500.  

Next, the cost of dress pants: 10 dress pants at 750 / 5 = 150 dollars each will be 10 x 150 = 1500. 

Next, the cost of dress shirts: 10 suits at 3 shirts per suit means he bought 30 dress shirts.  30 shirts at 60 dollars each will be 30 x 60 = 1800. 

Adding everything up, the total cost is 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800.  The answer is 10800. 
 Let's break this problem down into smaller parts.  We will calculate the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts separately, and then add them up. 

The cost of the suits is 10 suits x $750 per suit = 10 x 750 = $7500
The cost of the dress pants is 10 pants x $150 (1/5 of $750) per pant = 10 x 150 = $1500
The cost of the dress shirts is 10 suits x 3 shirts per suit x $60 per shirt = 10 x 3 x 60 = 1800

Now, we add up the costs:
$7500 + $1500 + $1800 = 10800

The answer is 10800.

2 websites are publishing news.  The news website publishes 20 articles per day and the sister company publishes 10 articles per day.  So in total they publish 20 + 10 = 30 articles per day.  There are 28 days in February.  So in total they published 30 * 28 = 840 articles.  The answer is 840. 
28 days in February.  Each day, the news website publishes 20 articles and the sister company publishes 10.  So in total, they publish 20 + 10 = 30 articles per day.  Multiply that by the number of days in the month: 30 articles/day * 28 days = 840 articles.  The answer is 840. 
20 political and weather news articles are published daily by the first website, and 10 business news articles are published daily by the second website.  Together, they publish 20 + 10 = 30 articles daily.  In February, which has 28 days, they will publish 30 articles/day * 28 days = 30 * 28 = 840 articles in total.  The answer is 840. 
2 news websites publish articles.  The first one publishes 20 articles daily.  The second one publishes 10 articles daily.  To find the total number of articles published daily, we add the articles of both websites.  This is 20 + 10 = 30. 

Since there are 28 days in February, the total number of articles published is 28 * 30 = 840.  The answer is 840. 
28 news articles were published daily.  The news website publishes 20 articles daily, and the sister company publishes 10 articles daily.  Together, they published 20 + 10 = 30 articles daily.

[EXP] 245: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife is 60 + 4 = 64.  Their son is half as old as his mom, so their son is 64 / 2 = 32.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.  The answer is 29. 
 Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  Since their son is half as old as his mom, he is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.  The answer is 29. 
1.  We know Steve is 60 years old.  His wife is 4 years older than him, which means she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old. 
2.  Their son is half as old as his mom, which means he is 64/2 = 32 years old. 
3.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, which means she is 32 - 3 = 29 years old. 
The answer is 29. 
 We need to find Steve's son's wife's age step by step. 

1.  Steve's wife is 4 years older than him, so Steve's wife's age = 60 + 4 = 64. 
2.  Steve's son is half as old as his mom, so Steve's son's age = 64 / 2 = 32. 
3.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so Steve's son's wife's age = 32 - 3 = 29. 

The answer is 29. 
 First, we need to figure out the age of Steve's wife and son.  Steve's wife is 4 years older than Steve, so she is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.  The son is half as old as the wife, so he is 1/2 x 64 = 32 years old.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
1.  First, we find the age of Steve's wife.  She is 4 years older than Steve, so she is 4 + 60 = 64 years old.  2.  Then we find the age of their son.  Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is half of 64.  Half of 64 is 64/2 = 32.  3.  Now we know the age of Steve's son's wife.  She is 3 years younger than her husband.  Since we know the age of her husband (32), we subtract 3 from that: 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29.

[EXP] 246: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 3 bags of flour.  Each bag has 8 portions of 2 kilograms each.  So each bag has 8 x 2 = 16 kilograms.  3 bags will have 3 x 16 = 48 kilograms.  The answer is 48. 
8 portions of 2 kilograms each means that 1 bag has a total of 8 x 2 = 16 kilograms.  So 3 bags will have 16 x 3 = 48 kilograms.  The answer is 48. 
8 portions of 2 kilograms each means that the total amount of flour in one bag is 8 * 2 = 16 kilograms.  If there were 3 bags, then the total amount of flour is 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.  The answer is 48. 
3 bags of flour each with 8 portions of 2 kilograms each means each bag had 2 * 8 = 16 kilograms.  So 3 bags in total would be 16 * 3 = 48 kilograms.  The answer is 48. 
3 bags means 8 * 3 = 24 portions of flour total.  Each portion is 2 kilograms, so 24 * 2 kilograms in total.  The answer is 48. 
3 bags of flour, each divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, already split into portions.  Each bag has 8 x 2 = 16 kilograms of flour.  So, 3 bags will have 16 x 3 = 48 kilograms of flour before it was divided into portions.  The answer is 48.

* Howie - 1
* His teacher - 1
* His 25 classmates - 25

So there are a total of 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people who need cupcakes.  Each person gets 2 cupcakes, so Howie needs to buy 2 x 27 = 54 cupcakes.  The answer is 54. 
 Howie wants to buy cupcakes for himself, his teacher, and 25 classmates.  That's a total of 1 (himself) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 27 people.  Howie is getting 2 cupcakes for each of these 27 people, so the total number of cupcakes he should buy is 2 x 27.  

2 x 27 = 54. 

The answer is 54. 
 Let's start with the number of people, including Howie himself, his teacher, and the 25 classmates.   1 + 1 + 25 = 27.  Now, Howie needs to buy 2 cupcakes for each of them.  So, we multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes needed for each person: 27 * 2 = 54. 

The answer is 54. 
1.  Count the number of people that need cupcakes.  There is Howie, his teacher, and 25 classmates.  So, 1 + 1 + 25 = 27 people need cupcakes. 

2.  Determine how many cupcakes each person will get.  Since he decides to get one vanilla and one chocolate for everyone, each person gets 2 cupcakes.  This means each person's total is 2 cupcakes. 

3.  Now calculate the total number of cupcakes that need to be bought.  Since everyone gets 2 cupcakes, multiply the number of people by the number of cupcakes each person gets to get the total number of cupcakes.  27 people * 2 cupcakes per person = 54 cupcakes total. 

4.  Howie has to buy that many cupcakes.  The answer is 54.

[EXP] 251: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 142, [output]:  On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at 20 dollars each.  That is 20 x 20 = 400 dollars.  After getting 2 dollars off, she paid 400 - 2 = 398 dollars.  On the second day, the price was 30 dollars per pomegranate.  So for 20 pomegranates, she paid 20 x 30 = 600 dollars.  With a 10% discount, she paid 90% of 600, which is 0. 9 * 600 = 540 dollars.  The difference between 398 and 540 is 540 - 398 = 142 dollars.  The answer is 142. 
20 pomegranates at 20 dollars each is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.  After the 2 dollar discount, Clara paid 400 - 2 = 398 dollars. 

The next day, 20 pomegranates at 30 dollars each is 20 * 30 = 600 dollars.  But there is a 10% discount on the total cost, so that is 10% of 600 = 0. 10 * 600 = 60 dollars.  So the final price Sheila paid is 600 - 60 = 540 dollars. 

The difference in cost is 540 - 398 = 142 dollars.  The answer is 142. 
 On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates for $20 each.  So she paid 20 x 20 = 400 dollars.  Then she got $2 off.  So she paid 400 - 2 = 398 dollars. 

On Wednesday, the price was $30 each, so 20 pomegranates will cost 20 x 30 = 600 dollars.  However, she got a 10% discount.  So she paid 600 - 10%*600 = 600 - 60 = 540 dollars. 

So, the difference between the final prices paid is 540 - 398 = 142.  The answer is 142. 
 On Tuesday, Clara spent 20 x 20 = 400 dollars on pomegranates.  Since she got a 2 dollar discount, she actually paid 400 - 2 = 398.  The next day, the pomegranates cost $30 each.  20 pomegranates for $30 each is 20 * 30 = 600.  But she got a 10% discount.  10% of 600 is 60.  600 - 60 is 540.  So she spent 540 dollars on the second day.  The difference is 540 - 398 = 142.  The answer is 142. 
 Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each on tuesday.  So that is 20 x 20 = 400 dollars.  But since she got 2 dollars off, the actual price is 400 - 2 = 398. 

The next day, the price is $30 per fruit.  20 x 30 = 600 dollars.  But there was a 10% discount, so 10% of 600 is 0. 1 x 600 = 60.  So 600 - 60 = 540. 

The difference between the costs is 540 - 398 = 142.  The answer is 142. 
1.  Original cost of pomegranates: 20 x 20 = 400 dollars. 
2.  After the voucher, the final cost becomes: 400 - 2 = 398 dollars. 
3.  On the next day, cost per pomegranate becomes 30 dollars.  The cost for 20 pomegranates will be: 20 x 30 = 600 dollars. 
4.  There is a 10% discount, which is (10/100) * 600 = 60 dollars.  After discount, the final cost becomes: 600 - 60 = 540 dollars.

[EXP] 252: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Let's start by using the information from the first month.  If the sales from red hats were 400 and half of the total amount from green hats, then the total amount from green hats is 400 * 2 = 800.  The total amount from both colors is 400 + 800 = 1200. 

Now we need to find the total amount in two months.  In the second month, sales were 3/4 of the first month.  The first month's sales were 1200, so the second month's sales are 3/4 * 1200 = 900.  The total amount in two months is the sum of the two months' sales, which is 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

1.  The sales from red hats were half the total amount earned from selling green hats, which means the total amount earned from selling green hats is 400 * 2 = 800. 
2.  The total amount earned in the first month is the sum of 400 from red hats and 800 from green hats, which is 400 + 800 = 1200. 
3.  The sales in the second month were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  1/4 of 1200 is 300, so 3/4 of it is 3 x 300 = 900.  This is the amount earned in the second month. 
4.  The total amount earned in two months is the sum of the amount earned in each month, which is 1200 + 900 = 2100. 

The answer is 2100. 
400 is half the amount she earned from selling green hats.  So the amount she earned from green hats is 2 x 400 = 800.  Since 400 from red hats is half, then total income from both colors is 800 + 400 = 1200 dollars.  Second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  1200 * 3/4 = 900.  1200 + 900 is 2100.  The answer is 2100.

[EXP] 253: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  James hired the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, and got 1 hour free, so the paid time was from 6 PM to 9 PM.  There are 3 paid hours and each paid hour except the first one is twice the cost.  So the cost for the first paid hour is 15 dollars.  For each hour after that, the cost is twice 15, which is 30 dollars.  So the total cost for hours 2 - 3 will be 2 x 30 = 60 dollars.  The total cost will be 15 + 60 = 75 dollars.  The answer is 75. 
 James hires a carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM.  That is 4 hours.  He gets an hour free, so we will subtract that from the total hours.  9 PM - 5 PM is 4 hours.  4 - 1 is 3.  So he actually paid for 3 hours.  The first hour is $15, so the total he paid for the first hour is $15.  Each additional hour costs twice the first hour, which is $30.  Since he paid for 3 hours, 2 additional hours, at $30 each, will be 2 x 30 = $60.  Add the first hour paid to the additional hours paid, 15 + 60 = 75.  The answer is 75.

[EXP] 254: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Sally started with 200 dollars.  After the week, she had 420 dollars.  So 420 - 200 = 220 dollars were added to her account.  Since her wage should be 300 dollars, 300 - 220 = 80 dollars were not received.  The answer is 80. 
420 - 200 = 220.  Sally should have had 300 dollars after getting her full wage, so she was withheld 300 - 220 = 80 dollars.  The answer is 80. 
 Sally started with 200 dollars in her bank account.  She ended with 420 dollars.  So the amount she earned must be 420 - 200 = 220.  But she should have earned 300 dollars, so the amount withheld from her wage must be 300 - 220 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
 Since Sally's bank account started with $200 and now holds $420, that means she gained $420 - $200 = $220 dollars.  However, her weekly wage should be $300.  So \$300 - \$220 = \$80 were withheld from her wage.  The answer is 80. 
 Sally's original amount is 200 dollars.  After receiving no other money, her current amount is 420 dollars.  So the difference, 420 - 200, is 220 dollars.  220 dollars is 220 dollars more than expected.  300 - 220 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
420 - 200 = 220 is the amount of money that was in Sally's bank account that was not there at the start of the week.  This means Sally received 220 more dollars than she should have, because she should have had 200 + 300 = 500, but instead she had 220.  So her wage by 300 should have put her at 500, and 500 - 420 = 80 was the amount that should have been in her account.  That means she was short 80.  The answer is 80.

1/3 of the 15-page research paper is 15/3 = 5 pages.  Since Shiela has already written 5 pages, she still has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.  The answer is 10. 
15 pages are required.  Shiela has finished 1/3 of the paper.  1/3 of 15 is 15/3 = 5.  So she has finished 5 pages.  Therefore, she has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.  The answer is 10. 
15 pages are required.  Sheila has finished 1/3 of the paper, which is 15 / 3 = 5 pages.  So, she has written 5 pages so far.  She has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.  The answer is 10. 
15 pages are required.  She has already written 1/3 of it.  So she wrote 15 * (1/3) = 5 pages.  There are 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.  The answer is 10. 
15 is the total number of pages the paper requires.  Sheila already finished 1/3 of it.  1/3 of 15 is 15/3 = 5 pages.  Then, she has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.  The answer is 10. 
 Shiela needs to write 15 pages.  She has already finished writing 1/3 of the paper.  15 divided by 3 is 5, so 1/3 of the paper is 5 pages.  Shiela has 5 pages written.  So, she has 15 - 5 = 10 pages left to write.  The answer is 10. 
15 is the total number of pages Shiela needs to write.  1/3 of 15 is 15 / 3 = 5 pages.  So, Shiela has already written 5 pages.  To get the pages left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has written (5) from the total number of pages (15).  15 - 5 = 10.  The answer is 10.

[EXP] 257: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Mike will read 10 pages a day.  To calculate how many days he needs to finish the book, we can divide 200 pages by 10 pages/day.  200 ÷ 10 = 20.  Mike will need 20 days to finish his reading.  Since the deadline is in 30 days, Mike will finish his reading 30 - 20 = 10 days before the deadline.  The answer is 10. 
200 pages have to be read, and 10 pages are to be read each day.  200 / 10 = 20 days it will take to finish the book.  Since there are 30 days in total, Mike will be done reading the book 30 - 20 = 10 days before the deadline.  The answer is 10. 
 Mike starts with 200 pages to read and he reads 10 pages per day.  To find out how many days it will take to finish, we can divide the total pages by the number of pages he reads per day:

200 pages / 10 pages per day = 20 days

Mike will finish his reading 20 days from today.  Since the deadline is 30 days, Mike will finish 30 - 20 = 10 days before the deadline. 

The answer is 10. 
 Mike plans to read at a rate of 10 pages per day.  To find how many days it takes to read the entire 200-page book, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads per day: 200 / 10 = 20 days.  Since the deadline is within 30 days, Mike will finish reading on day 20, which is 30 - 20 = 10 days before the deadline.  The answer is 10. 
10 pages a day means that Mike will read a total of 10 * 30 pages = 300 pages in 30 days.  If the book is 200 pages, then Mike will finish his reading 300 - 200 = 100 pages earlier than the deadline.  Since Mike plans to read 10 pages a day, it will take him 100 / 10 = 10 days to finish early, before the deadline.  The answer is 10. 
200 pages to be read in 30 days.  We have 30 days.  Each day, Mike reads 10 pages, so for 30 days, he will read 30 x 10 = 300 pages.  Since Mike needs to read 200 pages, he will finish his reading in 200/10 = 20 days.  Since the deadline is 30 days, Mike will finish 30 - 20 = 10 days early.  The answer is 10 days.

He pays 5000 dollars a month to rent a hanger, and 2 times that for fuel.  So that is 5000 + 5000 * 2 = 15,000 dollars per month.  James had to pay for 12 months, so that is 15,000 * 12 = 180,000.  150,000 for the plane plus 180,000 for the first year is 330,000.  The answer is 330000. 
 James buys a plane for 150000 dollars.  The cost does not include rent for the hanger and fuel.  To find out how much he spends on hanger and fuel per year, first find out how much he spends per month.  He spends 5000 dollars on hanger rental, and 2 times as much on fuel, which is 2 x 5000 = 10000 dollars.  This means he spends a total of 5000 + 10000 = 15000 dollars per month on hanger and fuel.  To find out how much he spends per year, calculate 15000 * 12 = 180000.  To get and maintain the plane for the first year, he spends the cost of the plane plus 180000, which is 150000 + 180000 = 330000 dollars.  The answer is 330000.

[EXP] 259: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the given information:
- It took Finley 30 minutes to cook rice. 
- It took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.  So, it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork. 
- Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  The combined cooking time is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of that is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 

Now, let's add up the time it took to cook all the food: 30 minutes for rice, 50 minutes for pork, and 40 minutes for beans.  30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes. 

The answer is 120. 
30 minutes for rice.  Pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes.  
Beans took half the combined time of pork and rice, which is 30 + 50 / 2 = 40 minutes.  Total time is 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's first figure out how long it took Finley to cook the beans.  It took her 30 minutes to cook the rice, and beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  Since pork took 20 minutes more to cook than rice, pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook.  Half of 30 + 50 is 40.  So, beans took 40 minutes to cook.  Now, we add the cooking times together: rice (30 minutes) + pork (50 minutes) + beans (40 minutes) = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
 Since it took her 30 minutes to cook rice, it took 20 minutes more to cook pork.  So it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook pork. 

The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Beans take half that time, so it took her 80/2 = 40 minutes to cook beans. 

To cook all the food, Finley needed to spend 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's break it down step by step! 

Finley took 30 minutes to cook rice.  If it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, then pork took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes. 

Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  Since pork took 50 minutes, and rice took 30 minutes, the combined cooking time is 50 + 30 = 80 minutes.  Beans took half of that, which is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. 

To find the total cooking time, add the cooking times for all three ingredients: 30 (rice) + 40 (beans) + 50 (pork) = 120 minutes. 

The answer is 120.

1/5 pound of almonds will cost 1/5 * 10 = 2 dollars.  1/3 pound of walnuts will still cost 1/3 * 15 = 5 dollars.  So the cost of a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts is 2 + 5 = 7 dollars. 

So the difference in cost between the two mixtures is 10 - 7 = 3 dollars.  The answer is 3. 
1/2 pound almonds will cost 1/2 x 10 = 5 dollars.  1/3 pound walnuts will cost 1/3 x 15 = 5 dollars.  So the mixture of almonds and walnuts will cost 5 + 5 = 10 dollars. 

Similarly, 1/5 pound almonds will cost 1/5 x 10 = 2 dollars.  1/3 pound walnuts will still cost 1/3 x 15 = 5 dollars.  So the mixture of almonds and walnuts will cost 2 + 5 = 7 dollars. 

So the difference in cost is 10 - 7 = 3 dollars.  The answer is 3 dollars. 
1/2 pound almonds costs 1/2 x 10 = 5 dollars.  1/3 pound walnuts costs 1/3 x 15 = 5 dollars.  So the first mixture costs 5 + 5 = 10 dollars. 

1/5 pound almonds costs 1/5 x 10 = 2 dollars.  Again, 1/3 pound walnuts costs 5 dollars.  So the second mixture costs 2 + 5 = 7 dollars. 

To find the difference, subtract the cost of the second mixture from the first mixture.  10 - 7 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
1/2 pound of almonds is 1/2 x 10 = 5 dollars.  1/3 pound of walnuts is 1/3 x 15 = 5 dollars.  5 + 5 is 10.  For 1/5 pound of almonds it's 1/5 x 10 = 2 dollars and the same 1/3 pound of walnuts for 5 dollars.  2 + 5 is 7.  So the difference is 10 - 7 = 3. 

The answer is 3. 
1/2 pound of almonds will cost 1/2 x 10 = 5 dollars.  1/3 pound of walnuts will cost 1/3 x 15 = 5 dollars.  In total, the mixture of almonds and walnuts will cost 5 + 5 = 10 dollars.  For the second mixture, 1/5 pound of almonds will be 1/5 x 10 = 2 dollars.  Since it is the same 1/3 pound of walnuts, the total cost will be 2 + 5 = 7 dollars. 

The difference in cost is 10 - 7 = 3.  The answer is 3 dollars.

The more expensive brand costs 20% more, or 1. 2 x 5 = 6 dollars per pound.  The total cost for the more expensive brand is 7 x 6 = 42 dollars.   After buying coffee, he also bought a donut for 2 dollars.   The total cost is 42 + 2 dollars.  42 + 2 is 44.  The answer is 44. 
 Roger needs coffee for a week.  7 days x 1 pound per day = 7 pounds.  The normal coffee costs 5 dollars per pound, so it would have cost 5 x 7 = 35 dollars.  The more expensive brand is 20% more, so 5 x (1. 2) = 6 dollars per pound.  6 x 7 = 42 dollars for the more expensive coffee.  He also buys a donut for 2 dollars, so everything costs 42 + 2 = 44 dollars.  The answer is 44. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

Roger normally buys coffee for $5 per pound.  But today, he has to buy the more expensive brand, which costs 20% more.  To find the price of the more expensive brand, we can multiply the original price by 1. 2: 5 x 1. 2 = 6 dollars per pound. 

Since he wants to buy a week's worth of coffee, he needs 7 pounds of coffee, since he uses 1 pound per day.  The cost of the more expensive coffee will be 6 dollars per pound, so the total cost will be 6 x 7 = 42 dollars. 

He also decides to buy a donut for $2.  To find the total cost, we add the cost of the coffee to the cost of the donut: 42 + 2 = 44. 

The answer is 44. 
1 pound of normal coffee costs 5 dollars.  He buys the more expensive brand that is 20% more.  20% of 5 dollars is 1 dollar.  So the more expensive brand costs 5 + 1 = 6 dollars.  Since he needs a week's worth of coffee, that's 7 days.  So, he needs 7 pounds of coffee.  7 pounds of normal brand would cost 7 x 5 = 35 dollars.  7 pounds of more expensive brand would cost 7 x 6 = 42 dollars.  After deciding on the more expensive brand, he buys 42 dollars worth of coffee.  He also buys a donut for 2 dollars.  42 + 2 = 44.  The answer is 44 dollars.

He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8 and a bottle of soda for $1.  So altogether he spent 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 dollars on those items.  Hence, the apple pie cost 20 - 13 = 7 dollars. 
 Gus started with 20 dollars.  The bag of chips cost 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.  The bucket of fried chicken cost 8 dollars.  The bottle of soda cost 1 dollar.  So the total cost of the items so far is 4 + 8 + 1 = 13.  So Gus has 20 - 13 = 7 dollars left.  The problem does not mention the cost of the apple pie, so we cannot determine the cost of the apple pie.  The answer is unknown. 
 Gus spent 20 dollars.  He bought chips for 2 * 2 = 4 dollars, fried chicken for 8 dollars, and a bottle of soda for 1 dollar.  So his total spend on those items was 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 dollars.  20 - 13 = 7 dollars left. 
 Gus spent $20. 00 total.  He bought 2 bins of chips for $2. 00 each, which is 2 x 2 = 4. 00.  He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8. 00 and a bottle of soda for $1. 00.  So, the total he spent on those items is 4. 00 + 8. 00 + 1. 00 = 13. 00.   Since he spent $20. 00 total, he must have spent $20. 00 - $13. 00 = $7. 00 on the apple pie. 
 Gus spent 20 dollars at the grocery store.  He spent 2 * 2 = 4 dollars on chips, 8 dollars on fried chicken, and 1 dollar on soda.  So, the total amount he spent on these items is 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 dollars.  He spent 20 dollars in total, and 13 dollars on those items, so the remaining money spent on the apple pie is 20 - 13 = 7. 
 Let's first find out how much money Gus spent on other items: 2 bags of chips for 2 dollars each is 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.  The bucket of fried chicken costs 8 dollars.  The bottle of soda costs 1 dollar.  So the total Gus spent on other items is 4 + 8 + 1 = 13 dollars.  He spent 20 dollars in total.  To find out how much the apple pie cost, we subtract the total spent on other items from the total amount he spent: 20 - 13 is 7. 
 Gus spent $20. 00, but we need to find out how much he spent on the apple pie.  First, let's find out how much he spent on the other items. 

He bought 2 bags of chips for $2. 00 each, so that is 2 x 2. 00 = 4. 00. 

He also bought a bucket of fried chicken for $8. 00 and a bottle of soda for $1. 00.  So he spent 8. 00 + 1. 00 = 9. 00 on these items. 

In total, he spent 4. 00 + 9. 00 = 13. 00 on items other than the apple pie. 

He spent $20. 00 in total, so he must have spent $20. 00 - 13. 00 = $7. 00 on the apple pie. 

The answer is $7. 00. 
 Let's first calculate how much Gus spent on the bag of chips, fried chicken, and soda:
Gus spent 2 x 2. 00 = 4 dollars on chips
Gus spent 8. 00 on the fried chicken
Gus spent 1. 00 on the soda
Total amount he spent on these items: 4 + 8 + 1 = 13

Gus initially had 20 dollars, so he has 20 - 13 = 7 dollars left

The question asks for the cost of the apple pie, which is not mentioned in the problem.  Since Gus had 7 dollars left, and 7 dollars were not spent on the given items, we can conclude that the apple pie cost 0 dollars.

600 newspapers are delivered in total.  198 were delivered to District A, and 209 were delivered to District C.  198 + 209 is 407.  This leaves 600 - 407 = 193 newspapers for District B.  The answer is 193. 
600 newspapers were delivered in total.  198 were delivered to District A.  209 were delivered to District C.  To find out how many were delivered to District B, we need to subtract the number delivered to District A and District C from the total.  

600 - 198 - 209 = 193

The answer is 193. 
600 newspapers are delivered in a day.  He delivers 198 to District A.  He delivers 209 to District C.  So he must have delivered the remaining to District B.  600 - 198 - 209 = 193.  The answer is 193. 
600 newspapers are delivered total.  198 are to District A and 209 are to District C.  So, the remaining newspapers are for District B.  600 - (198 + 209) = 600 - 407 = 193.  The answer is 193. 
600 newspapers were delivered in total.  198 were delivered to District A.  209 were delivered to District C.  We need to subtract 198 and 209 from 600 to get the number of newspapers delivered to District B.  600 - 198 = 402 and 402 - 209 = 193.  The answer is 193. 
600 newspapers were delivered in a day.  James delivered 198 to District A.  He also delivered 209 to District C.

4 classes per week multiplied by 6 weeks is 4 x 6 = 24 classes.  Each class is 2 hours, so in total he has 2 x 24 = 48 hours of class time.  He learns a new recipe for every 1. 5 hours, so the total number of recipes he learns is 48 ÷ 1. 5 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
4 classes a week for 2 hours each time means John goes to class 4 x 2 = 8 hours a week.  6 weeks of classes will be 8 x 6 = 48 hours.  If he learns a new recipe for every 1. 5 hours, then he will learn 48 / 1. 5 = 32 new recipes.  The answer is 32. 
 John's cooking class is 4 times a week.  Each time is 2 hours, so the total class time per week is 2 * 4 = 8 hours.  He does this for 6 weeks, so the total class time is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.   Since he learns a new recipe every 1. 5 hours, the number of recipes he learns is 48 / 1. 5 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
4 times a week for 6 weeks will make 4 x 6 = 24 times that the class meets.  The class is 2 hours long each time, so the total class time is 24 x 2 = 48 hours.  Since John learns a new recipe for every 1. 5 hours of class time, he will learn 48 / 1. 5 recipes.  48 / 1. 5 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
 John takes the class for 6 weeks, and each class meets 4 times a week.  So, in total, John has attended 6 x 4 = 24 classes.  Each class lasted for 2 hours.  So he spent a total of 24 x 2 = 48 hours in class.  He learns a new recipe every 1. 5 hours.  So, he learns 48 / 1. 5 = 32 recipes.  The answer is 32. 
4 times a week for 6 weeks means 4 * 6 = 24 times.  Since each class is 2 hours, John was in class for a total of 2 * 24 = 48 hours.  Since he learns a new recipe every 1. 5 hours, he learns a new recipe every 1. 5 hours or 2 recipes every 3 hours.  So in 48 hours, John learns 48 / 3 * 2 = 32 recipes.  The answer is 32.

The answer is 360 hours. 
60% of the teachers are history teachers.  So 60% of 150 is 0. 6 * 150 = 90 teachers are history teachers.  That leaves 150 - 90 = 60 teachers who are math teachers.  Each of these math teachers sleep for 6 hours a day, so together they sleep for 6 * 60 = 360 hours in a day.  The answer is 360. 
60% of 150 = 60 / 100 * 150 = 90 history teachers.  150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.  Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours, and there are 60 teachers.  The total time the math teachers sleep is 60 * 6 = 360 hours.  The answer is 360. 
60% of teachers are history teachers.  So, 40% are math teachers.  40% of 150 is (40/100) x 150 = 0. 4 x 150 = 60.  So there are 60 math teachers.  Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day.  So they collectively sleep for 60 teachers x 6 hours = 360 hours.  The answer is 360.

[EXP] 267: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Kassidy has 3/4 times as much as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.  Rayna has 60 more than Kassidy, so 90 + 60 = 150.  In total they have 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.  If they share equally, they each get 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
 If Aurelia has 120 dollars, Kassidy has 3/4 of that, which is 90 dollars.  Rayna has 60 dollars more than Kassidy, so she has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.  In total, they have 150 + 90 + 120 = 360 dollars.  If they split it equally among themselves, each would have 360 / 3 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
 Since Aurelia has 120 dollars, Kassidy has 3/4 of that, which is 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.  Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.  If they decide to add together their money and share equally, they would first add up to 120 + 90 + 150 = 360.  Then they would divide that by 3, since there are three of them.  360 / 3 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's work backwards to solve this problem.  Aurelia has $120.  Kassidy has 3/4 of what Aurelia has, so Kassidy has 120 * (3/4) = 90 dollars.  Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, so she has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars. 

After they add together their money, they have 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars. 

They will now share equally, so each person will get 360 ÷ 3 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120.

7 candies of type A cost 7 * 0. 5 = 3. 5 dollars.  10 candies of type B cost 10 * 0. 75 = 7. 5 dollars.  So the total cost of the candies is 3. 5 + 7. 5 = 11 dollars.  If Adam paid with 15 dollars, he gets 15 - 11 = 4 dollars change.  The answer is 4. 
 Adam paid for 7 candies of type A, each costing $0. 5, which is 7 x $0. 5 = $3. 5.  He also paid for 10 candies of type B, each costing $0. 75, which is 10 x $0. 75 = $7. 5.  So in total, he paid $3. 5 + $7. 5 = $11.  He paid $15 in total, so he got $15 - $11 = $4 as change.  The answer is 4. 
7 candies of type A at 50 cents each is 7 x 0. 5 = 3. 50.  10 candies of type B at 0. 75 each is 10 x 0. 75 = 7. 5.  So Adam's total cost is 3. 50 + 7. 50 = 11. 00.  Since he paid with 15 dollars, his change is 15 - 11. 00 = 4. 00.  The answer is 4. 00. 
 Let's calculate the total cost of the candies first.  Type A candies cost $0. 5 each, and Adam bought 7 of them.  7 * 0. 5 = 3. 5.  Type B candies cost $0. 75 each, and Adam bought 10 of them.  10 * 0. 75 = 7. 5.  In total, the cost of the candies is 3. 5 + 7. 5 = 11.  Adam paid with a $15 bill.  So the change he should get is 15 - 11 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B will cost 7 * 0. 5 = 3. 5 dollars and 10 * 0. 75 = 7. 50 dollars.  In total, that's 3. 5 + 7. 50 = 11. 00 dollars.  Adam paid 15 dollars, so he should get a change of 15 - 11. 00 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
 Adam bought 7 candies of type A, so the cost was 7 x $0. 5 = $3. 5.  Adam also bought 10 candies of type B, so the cost was 10 x $0. 75 = $7. 5.  In total, the cost of candies was $3. 5 + $7. 5 = $11.  If Adam paid $15, he will get $15 - $11 = $4 change.  The answer is 4. 
7 candies of type A and 10 candies of type B.  Adam paid $15 in total.  Adam paid in $15.  But he had to pay for some candies with that money.  The cost of candies are types A at $0. 50 each, so $0. 5 * 7 = $3. 50.  Then he bought 10 candies of type B at $0. 75 each, so $0. 75 * 10 = $7. 50.  So the total cost of the candies is $3. 50 + $7. 50 = $11.  He paid $15 but the total cost of the candies is only $11.  So he gets $15 - $11 = $4 in change.  The answer is 4.

[EXP] 275: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 20 feet is 20 * 12 = 240 inches.  So the bamboo was originally 240 inches tall.  It's going to grow up to 600 inches.  So it needs to grow 600 - 240 = 360 inches more.  It grows 30 inches per day.  So it needs 360 / 30 = 12 days to grow that much.  The answer is 12. 
20 feet is equal to 20 x 12 inches = 240 inches.  Currently, the height of the bamboo is 240 inches.  It grows 30 inches a day.  To find the number of days it will take for the bamboo to grow to 600 inches, we can subtract 240 from 600 to get 360.  Then we divide 360 by 30 to get the number of days.  360 / 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
1 foot is 12 inches, so Mrs.  Jameson's bamboo is currently 20 x 12 = 240 inches tall.  It needs to grow to 600 inches.  The amount it needs to grow is 600 - 240 = 360 inches.  It grows 30 inches a day, so to find out how many days it will take to grow the necessary 360 inches, divide 360 by 30.  360 / 30 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
20 feet is equal to 240 inches (20 * 12).  The bamboo is currently 240 inches tall.  It grows 30 inches per day, so to find out how many days it takes to reach 600 inches, we need to find the difference between 600 and 240, which is 360 inches.  Then, divide this by the growth rate of 30 inches per day.  360 / 30 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Mrs.  Jameson's bamboo is initially 20 feet, which is 20 x 12 = 240 inches.  After that, it grows 30 inches per day.  We want to know how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches.  The difference between 600 and 240 is 360.  If it grows 30 inches per day, it will take 360/30 = 12 days to grow 360 inches more.  The answer is 12.

Skyler's investment is 240 dollars.  The answer is 240 dollars. 
3 people invested 1200 dollars.  Dylan's investment is 2/5 of 1200 = 2/5 * 1200 = 480.  1200 - 480 = 720.  After Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining, he will invest 2/3 * 720 = 480 dollars.  The remaining amount will be the part accounted for by Skyler.  720 - 480 = 240.  The answer is 240. 
3 people invested 1200 dollars.  So, the total amount is 1200.  After Dylan invested 2/5 of 1200, he must have invested 1200 * 2/5 = 480 dollars.  Remaining amount is 1200 - 480 = 720.  Now, 2/3 of the remaining is 720 * 2/3 = 480.  720 - 480 is 240.  So, Skyler invested 240 dollars.  The answer is 240. 
 Three people invested $1200 in a joint savings account.   After Dylan's investment of 2/5 of the total amount. 

Dylan's investment will be (2/5) * 1200 = 480
Remaining amount will be 1200 - 480 = 720

Then Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount

Frances's investment will be (2/3) * 720 = 480

So remaining amount will be 720 - 480 = 240

So Skyler's investment accounted for the rest which is 240.  The answer is 240. 
3 people, 1200 dollars, sounds like a pattern! So we start with 1200 dollars. 

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480 dollars. 

So, the remaining amount is 1200 - 480 = 720. 

Frances' investment is 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is (2/3) * 720 = 480. 

So, the remaining amount is 720 - 480 = 240. 

Skyler's investment is the rest, which is 240 dollars. 

The answer is 240. 
 Three people started with 1200 dollars.  After Dylan's investment of 2/5 of the total, he invested 2/5 x 1200 = 480 dollars, hence 1200 - 480 = 720 remaining.   Frances then invested 2/3 of the remaining amount, which is 2/3 x 720 = 480 dollars.   So, Frances invested 480 dollars, and the remaining amount for Skyler's investment is 720 - 480 = 240 dollars.

 Lorie earns 10 dollars per hour.  Karen earns twice that, so Karen earns 10 x 2 = 20 dollars per hour.  She works 3 hours per day, so she earns 20 x 3 = 60 dollars per day.  She works for 2 days, so the total amount she earns is 60 x 2 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
 If Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns 10 dollars per hour, then Karen earns 2 * 10 = 20 dollars per hour.  Karen works 3 hours per day, so she earns 20 * 3 = 60 dollars per day.  After 2 days, she has 2 * 60 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
 Since Lorie earns $10 per hour, and Karen earns twice that amount, Karen earns $20 per hour. 

Karen works 3 hours per day, so in one day, she earns 3 * 20 = 60. 

If she works for 2 days, she earns 60 * 2 = 120. 

The answer is 120. 
 Lorie earns 10 dollars per hour.  Karen earns twice as much, so Karen earns 10 * 2 = 20 dollars per hour.  If she works for 3 hours a day and for 2 days, Karen works for 3 * 2 = 6 hours.  The total amount she earns is 20 * 6 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 First, we need to figure out how much Karen earns per hour.  Karen earns twice what Lorie earns, and Lorie earns $10 per hour.  So Karen earns 2 x 10 = 20 dollars per hour. 

To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per day, and then multiply that by the number of days.  In this case, she works 3 hours per day, so 3 x 20 = 60 dollars per day.  For two days, she earns 60 x 2 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
 Lorie earns $10 per hour.  Karen earns twice as much, so Karen earns $10 x 2 = $20 per hour.  To find out how much Karen earns in two days, we need to multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works in two days.  Karen works 3 hours per day, so in 2 days she works 3 x 2 = 6 hours.  Karen's 6-hour day salary is 6 x 20 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 We are given that Lorie earns $10 per hour and Karen earns twice what Lorie earns.  That means Karen earns $20 per hour. 

After that, we know Karen works 3 hours per day.  So, in 1 day, she earns 20 * 3 = 60 dollars. 

Since Karen works for 2 days, she earns 60 * 2 = 120 dollars. 

The answer is 120.

6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, so to make 1 hash brown, we need 6/36 = 1/6 of a potato.  To make hash browns out of 96 potatoes, we can multiply 96 by (1 hash brown / 1/6 potato) = 96 x 6 = 576 hash browns.  The answer is 576. 
6 potatoes makes 36 hash browns.  If we calculate 36 ÷ 6 = 6, then 1 potato makes 6 hash browns.  Now, if we know that we have 96 potatoes, then 96 potatoes will make 6 × 96 hash browns.  6 × 96 is 576.  The answer is 576.

[EXP] 281: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 8 adults, each weighing 80 kg, will weigh a total of 8 x 80 = 640 kg.  Jack himself also gets on the elevator, so the total weight is 640 + 80 = 720 kg.  This is 720 - 700 = 20 kg more than the maximum load of 700 kg.  The answer is 20. 
8 adults weigh an average of 8 x 80 = 640 kg.  If Jack also gets in, that is another 80 kg.  So the total weight is 640 + 80 = 720 kg.  The elevator can only carry 700 kg.  The excess weight is 720 - 700 = 20 kg.  The answer is 20. 
 The elevator has a maximum load of 700 kg.  Jack weighs 80 kg, so 8 other adults will be 8 x 80 = 640 kg.  So in total, the load will be 80 + 640 = 720.  This is exceeding the maximum load by 720 - 700 = 20 kg.  The answer is 20. 
8 adults weighed, on average, 8 * 80 = 640 kg.  Jack weighed himself who weighed 80 kg.  So the total weight was 640 + 80 = 720 kg.  The maximum load is 700 kg.  To find the excess, subtract the maximum load from the total weight: 720 - 700 = 20.  The answer is 20.

[EXP] 282: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 298, [output]:  Let's start by using the information given.  Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and Katarina has 68 cookies, then Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. 

Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. 

Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies. 

To find the total number of cookies, add the number of cookies each person has:

68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

The answer is 298. 
 Let's start with the information given.  Katarina has 68 cookies.  We know that she has 5 less cookies than Max has, so Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. 

We also know that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.  So the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. 

Finally, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies. 

The total number of cookies they have is 68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298.  The answer is 298. 
1st, let's find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has.  Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, and Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, we can write an equation:

Katarina's cookie count = Max's cookie count - 5

We know Katarina has 68 cookies, so:

68 = Max's cookie count - 5

To find Max's cookie count, add 5 to both sides of the equation:

68 + 5 = Max's cookie count
73 = Max's cookie count

So Max has 73 cookies.  Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, the Cookie Monster has:

73 - 12 = 61

So the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. 

Finally, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so:

Summer's cookie count = Max's cookie count + 23
Summer's cookie count = 73 + 23
Summer's cookie count = 96

Now we have the cookie count for each person: Katarina (68), Max (73), the Cookie Monster (61), and Summer (96).  Adding them up gives us the total:

68 + 73 + 61 + 96 = 298

The answer is 298. 
 Katarina has 68 cookies.  We are given the following information: 
 - Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max has. 
 - Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, and we don't know how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. 
 - Summer has 23 more cookies than Max. 

We need to find out how many cookies Max has, then how many cookies the Cookie Monster has, then add them up. 

First, Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.  So Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. 

Second, we are told that Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. 

Finally, Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies. 

To find the total number of cookies, we add them: Katarina's 68 + Max's 73 + Cookie Monster's 61 + Summer's 96 = 298

The answer is 298.

[EXP] 283: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]: 140 - 20 = 120.  This is the length of the dress after extending it by 50%.  Let's say its original length was x.  x + 50% of x = 120.  50% of x is 0. 5x.  So, x + 0. 5x = 120.  1. 5x = 120.  Divide both sides by 1. 5, 1x = 80.  The answer is 80. 
 Let the original length of the dress be x.  The original length is extended by 50% of its original length.  This means the new length is x + 0. 5x = 1. 5x.  Then, 20 cm is added to the bottom, making the total length 1. 5x + 20.  This is equal to 140 cm.  We set up the equation 1. 5x + 20 = 140 and solve for x.  To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides, giving us 1. 5x = 120.  Then, we divide both sides by 1. 5, giving us x = 80.  The answer is 80. 
 Shania's final dress length is 140cm.  The length is extended by 50% of its original length, and 20cm is added.  So, let's first subtract 20cm to find the length before the lace trim was added: 140 - 20 = 120.  This 120cm length is after the 50% extension, so the original length should be 120 / 1. 5 = 80cm.  The answer is 80.

[EXP] 284: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Since the turtle mode takes 1 hour or 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, half the lawn will take 60/2 = 30 minutes.  The rabbit mode takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, so half the lawn will take 40/2 = 20 minutes.  In total, Chris spent 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to mow the lawn.  The answer is 50. 
 The time to mow the whole lawn in "turtle" mode is 1 hour, which is 60 minutes.  So, half of it would be 30 minutes.  In "rabbit" mode, it would take 40 minutes, so half of it would be 20 minutes.  To find how many minutes it took him to mow the lawn, we add the half-time for both modes: 30 + 20 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
7th problem

Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour in turtle mode.  This means it will take Chris 60 minutes in turtle mode.  Then he can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes in rabbit mode.  Half the lawn is 1/2, also written as . 5.  To find out how many minutes it took mowing half the lawn in turtle mode, first convert . 5 hours to minutes, by multiplying . 5 * 60 = 30 minutes.  To find the time for half the lawn in rabbit mode, . 5 * 40 = 20 minutes.  Adding up the time in turtle mode and rabbit mode, 30 + 20 = 50.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 285: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]: 30 minutes is the total amount of time they have to get to school.  6 minutes to get to the corner + 13 minutes to get to the fire station is 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.  So, they have 30 - 19 minutes left to get to school.  30 - 19 is 11.  The answer is 11. 
30 minutes is the total time John and Jack have to walk to school.  It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is and 13 more minutes to get to the fire station.  So in total it takes them 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.  Now, they have 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left to get to school.  The answer is 11. 
30 minutes total time, 6 minutes to the library, 13 minutes to the fire station.  6 + 13 = 19 minutes.  After that, they still have 30 - 19 = 11 minutes to get to school.  The answer is 11. 
30 minutes to walk to school, they need to spend 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.  So they have 30 - 6 = 24 minutes left.  After getting to the corner, it takes them 13 minutes to get to the fire station.  So they have 24 - 13 = 11 minutes left.  The answer is 11. 
 John and Jack have 30 minutes originally.  It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is.  It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.  So, in total, they will take 6 + 13 = 19 minutes to get to the fire station.  They have 30 minutes originally, so they will have 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left.  The answer is 11. 






Let's break this problem down step by step:

1.  They have 30 minutes to walk to school. 
2.  It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is. 
3.  It takes them another 13 minutes to get to the fire station. 
4.  We know that they are currently at the fire station, so we can add the time it took them to get there (6 + 13 = 19 minutes) to the total time they have to get to school (30 minutes). 

So, in total, they have spent 19 minutes walking and have 30 - 19 = 11 minutes left to get to school. 

But, since they still have to get to school, we don't want the time they've spent getting to the fire station.  We want the time they have left to get to school from the fire station, which is 11 minutes. 

The answer is 11 minutes.

He will pay 64 and 125 - 64 = 61 dollars will be left.  The answer is 61. 
 John brings 125 dollars to the vet.  His dog needs 2 vaccines for 20 dollars each, that is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  So, his total bill is 40 dollars.  His heartworm check is 60% of his total bill.  60% of 40 is 0. 6 x 40 = 24.  So, his heartworm check is 24 dollars.  His total cost is 24 + 40 = 64 dollars.  He will pay 64 dollars, leaving him with 125 - 64 = 61 dollars.  The answer is 61. 
 John's dog needs 2 vaccines at $20 each, so the total bill for the vaccines is 2 x 20 = 40.  The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.  This is the same as 0. 60 x (40 + unknown).  We can set up the equation:

    0. 60 x (40 + unknown) = unknown

The part that is known is 0. 60 x 40 = 24.  So now we know the equation is 24 + unknown = unknown.  The unknown must be 24.  That means the total bill is 40 + 24 = 64 dollars.  John started with 125 dollars.  After spending 64 dollars, he has 125 - 64 = 61 dollars left.  The answer is 61.

[EXP] 293: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 1 banana costs 2 x 0. 5 = 1 dollars.  An orange costs 3 x 1 = 3 dollars.  Each apple costs 0. 5 dollars.  A crate consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples, and 7 oranges.  So the total cost of the fruits is 5 x 1 + 12 x 0. 5 + 7 x 3 = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
12 apples, each costing 0. 5 dollars, will be 12 x 0. 5 = 6.  5 bananas, each costing twice as much as apples (so 1 dollar each), will be 5 x 1 = 5.  7 oranges, each costing three times as much as bananas (3 dollars each), will be 7 x 3 = 21.  So the total price of the crate is 6 + 5 + 21 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
1 banana costs 2 times 0. 5 dollars which is 1 dollar.  1 orange costs 3 times 1 dollar which is 3 dollars.  All together: (1 x 5) + (0. 5 x 12) + 3 x 7 = 5 + 6 + 21 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's start by determining the price of the fruits:

* 1 banana costs twice as much as $0. 5, so 2 x $0. 5 = $1. 00
* 1 orange costs three times as much as a banana, so 3 x $1. 00 = $3. 00
* 1 apple costs $0. 5

The crate consists of:

* 5 bananas at $1. 00 each: 5 x $1. 00 = $5. 00
* 12 apples at $0. 5 each: 12 x $0. 5 = $6. 00
* 7 oranges at $3. 00 each: 7 x $3. 00 = $21. 00

The total price of the crate is: $5. 00 + $6. 00 + $21. 00 = $32. 00

The answer is 32. 
1 apple costs $0. 5, and 1 banana costs twice as much, so 1 banana costs $1.  Oranges are three times the cost of bananas, so each orange costs $3.  

Let's find the total cost of each type of fruit in one crate:
- Bananas: 5 bananas * $1/banana = $5
- Apples: 12 apples * $0. 5/apple = $6
- Oranges: 7 oranges * $3/orange = $21

Now calculate the total cost of one crate: 
$5 (bananas) + $6 (apples) + $21 (oranges) = $32

The answer is 32. 
1 apple costs $0. 5.  A banana costs twice as much as an apple, so it costs 2 x 0. 5 = $1.  An orange costs three times as much as a banana, so it costs 3 x 1 = $3.  The total cost of one fruit is $1 + 0. 5 + 3 = $4. 5.  The total cost of one crate is the total cost of one fruit multiplied by the number of each fruit: 5 bananas: 5 x 1 = 5$, 12 apples: 12 x 0. 5 = $6, 7 oranges: 7 x 3 = 21$.  So the total cost of the crate is 5 $+ 6 $+ 21 $= 32$.  The answer is 32$.

 Brittany started with 14 red squares.  There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so she has 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so she has 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so she has 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

The total number of colored squares is 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68.  Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so each square is 1 square foot.  68 squares is 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
 Brittany's quilted comforter has 14 red squares, and 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  18 + 6 = 24 green squares, and 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  

So in total, there are 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  Each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, so there are 68 square feet in total.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's start with the red squares.  There are 14 red squares, each 1 foot by 1 foot.  That's 14 square feet.  There are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, that's 18 square feet.  There are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so that's 24 square feet.  There are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so that's 12 square feet.  In total, the comforter is made up of 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

First, Brittany's comforter had 14 red squares.  Then, it had 4 more blue squares than red squares, so it had 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares. 

Next, it had 6 more green squares than blue squares, so it had 18 + 6 = 24 green squares. 

Finally, it had 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so it had 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

Now, let's find the total number of squares:

Red squares: 14
Blue squares: 18
Green squares: 24
White squares: 12

Add them all up: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares

Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so the total area is:

68 squares * 1 foot by 1 foot = 68 square feet

The answer is 68.

[EXP] 295: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 8 high chairs means there must be 8 x 5 = 40 regular chairs.  So in total, there are 40 + 8 = 48 chairs.  With 42 adults and 15 babies, there will be 42 + 15 = 57 people.  So she needs to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.  The answer is 9. 
 There are 42 adults and 15 babies, so in total there are 42 + 15 = 57 people.  Since there are 8 high chairs and the ratio of regular chairs to high chairs is 5:1, there must be 5 x 8 = 40 regular chairs.  So in total, there are 8 high chairs + 40 regular chairs = 48 chairs.  But there are 57 people.  So 57 - 48 = 9 chairs need to be gotten.  The answer is 9. 
42 adults and 15 babies will be attending.  That means there will be a total of 42 + 15 = 57 people. 

There will be 8 high chairs, which are for the babies.  For the adults, they have 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.  So they have 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs. 

The total number of chairs needed is 57.  They already have 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, which is a total of 8 + 40 = 48 chairs.  So, they have to get 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.  The answer is 9. 
8 high chairs are available.  There are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.  So, 8 * 5 = 40 regular chairs.  In total, there will be 42 adults, so she needs 42 chairs for the adults and 15 for the babies.  42 + 15 = 57 total chairs needed.  Already, there are 8 high chairs and 40 regular chairs, so in total, there are 8 + 40 = 48 chairs.  To find the difference, subtract the total chairs available from the total chairs needed: 57 - 48 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
42 adults and 15 babies means there are a total of 42 + 15 = 57 people.  High chairs and regular chairs will be used for these people.  There are 8 high chairs, so there are 57 - 15 = 42 people who will not be in high chairs.  Since there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, there are 5 x 8 = 40 regular chairs.  So the total number of chairs is 8 (high chairs) + 40 (regular chairs) = 48 chairs.  The question asks for how many more chairs Mia has to get.  Since there are 57 people and she has only 48 chairs, she needs 57 - 48 = 9 more chairs.  The answer is 9.

50% of the deer are bucks, which means 50/100 * 50 = 25 bucks.  20% of the bucks are 8 points, which means 20/100 * 25 = 5 8-point bucks.  The answer is 5. 
50 deer * 50% (which is 0. 5) = 25 are bucks. 
25 bucks * 20% (which is 0. 2) = 5 are 8 point bucks. 
The answer is 5. 
50 percent of 50 deer is 50 x 0. 5 = 25.  So 25 are bucks.  20 percent of those are 8-point bucks.  0. 2 x 25 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
50 percent of the deer are bucks means that 50/100 or 0. 5 of the deer are bucks.  So the number of buck deer is 0. 5 x 50 = 25. 

20 percent of the bucks are 8 points means that 20/100 or 0. 2 of the bucks are 8 points.  So the number of 8 point bucks is 0. 2 x 25 = 5. 

The answer is 5. 
50 deer in total.  50% are bucks, so 50% x 50 = 25 are bucks.  

25 bucks are available.  20% of those are 8 point bucks.  So 20% x 25 = 5 are 8 point bucks.

[EXP] 297: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 145, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Adam has 50 points. 
Betty is 30% more than Adam, so Betty has 50 + (30% of 50) = 65 points. 
Tom is 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points. 
Marta is 3 times more than Tom, so Marta has 35 * 3 = 105 points. 

The total points they have is 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points. 

To go on the trip, they need a minimum of 400 points.  So, they are missing 400 - 255 = 145 points. 

The answer is 145. 
 Let's first find how many points Betty has.  Betty has 30% more than Adam, so she has 30% of 50 points more.  30% is the same as 0. 3, so she has 0. 3 x 50 = 15 more points.  Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points. 

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so he has 65 - 30 = 35 points. 

Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, so she has 3 x 35 = 105 points. 

In total, the class has 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255 points. 

They need 400 points to go on the trip, so they are missing 400 - 255 = 145 points.  The answer is 145. 
 We need to find the total points of the other students. 

Betty collected 30% more than Adam, so Betty has 50 + (30% of 50) = 50 + 15 = 65 points. 

Tom has 30 points less than Betty, so Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points. 

Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, so Marta has 35 * 3 = 105 points. 

We now have the total points: Adam (50 points) + Betty (65 points) + Tom (35 points) + Marta (105 points) = 255 points. 

So the total points they have is 255. 

The minimum threshold is 400 points, so the class is 400 - 255 = 145 points short of the minimum threshold. 

The answer is 145.

After that, she has 2400 - 1200 = 1200 dollars left.  Then she uses 20% of her paycheck to pay for her car, which is 2400 * 0. 2 = 480 dollars.  After paying for her car, she has 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars left.  The answer is 720. 
 Greta started with 2400 dollars.  She put 50% into her retirement account.  50% of 2400 is 50/100 * 2400 = 1200.  So she has 2400 - 1200 = 1200 left after calculating retirement.  Now, she uses 20% to make her car payment.  20% of 2400 is 20/100 * 2400 = 480.  480 is subtracted from 1200 to get 1200 - 480 = 720.  The answer is 720. 
 Greta started with a paycheck of $2400. 00.  She puts 50% of her paycheck into her retirement account, which is 50% of 2400, which is 50/100 x 2400 = 1200.  1200 dollars goes into her retirement, so she is left with 2400 - 1200 = 1200 dollars. 

After that, she uses 20% of her paycheck to make her car payment, which is 20% of 2400, which is 20/100 x 2400 = 480.  She spends 480 dollars, so she is left with 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars. 

The answer is 720. 
2400 dollars is Greta's initial pay.  

She puts 50% into her retirement account.  50% of 2400 is 1200, so she puts 1200 dollars into her retirement account. 

After that, she has 2400 - 1200 = 1200 dollars left.  

Then, she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment.  20% of 2400 is 480, so she uses 480 more dollars from her paycheck.  

Now, she has 1200 - 480 = 720 dollars left.  

The answer is 720. 
 Greta had 2400 dollars.  She puts 50% of her pay into retirement, so 2400 * 0. 5 = 1200 is put into retirement.  Then she uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment.  2400 * 0. 2 = 480 is used for the car payment.  So, after the retirement and car payment, she has 2400 - 1200 - 480 dollars left.  Subtracting the amounts from her paycheck, we get 2400 - 1200 = 1200 and 1200 - 480 = 720.  The answer is 720.

 Aiden and 12 of his friends will make a total of 12 + 1 = 13 people.  Then, they meet up with 7 more friends, so a total of 13 + 7 = 20 people.  Each person will save one seat, so they will need 20 total seats.  Each seat holds one person, two drinks, and three snacks.  So they will need 20 x 2 = 40 drinks and 20 x 3 = 60 snacks.  Drinks and snacks cost 2 dollars each, so they will need 40 x 2 = 80 dollars for drinks and 60 x 2 = 120 dollars for snacks.  Total, they will need 80 + 120 = 200 dollars.  The answer is 200.

Gordy's truck is 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.  Together, Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds.  We know that together with Gary's truck, they can haul 11,600 pounds.  So Gary's truck can haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.  The answer is 2,800. 
 Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.  Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds.  Together, Gissela and Gordy's trucks can haul 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800.  Add Gary's truck, which they can haul 11,600 pounds.  So Gary's truck can haul 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.  The answer is 2,800. 
 Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds.  Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more, so Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800.  Together, the two have a total capacity of 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800.  Gary's truck brings the total capacity to 11,600.  So Gary's truck must have a capacity of 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.  The answer is 2,800. 
 Let's start by analyzing the information given.  Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel, and Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  So Gordy's truck can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel. 

The three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.  So, we need to find the total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul, and then subtract that from the total weight to find the weight that Gary's truck can haul. 

Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds, and Gordy's truck can haul 4,800 pounds.  The total weight that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can haul is 4,000 + 4,800 = 8,800 pounds. 

Now, subtracting this from the total weight that the three trucks can haul, we get:

11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800

Therefore, Gary's truck can haul 2,800 pounds of gravel.  The answer is 2,800.

[EXP] 304: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's start by finding the number of dumplings eaten by the males.  Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, and each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.  Since there are 8 males, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 x 4 = 32.  The total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 6 x 3 = 18.  The total number of dumplings eaten is the sum of the number eaten by the males and the females, which is 32 + 18 = 50.  Since Larry cooked dumplings for his friends and there were no leftovers, the number of dumplings Larry cooked is equal to the total number of dumplings eaten.  The answer is 50. 
8 males ate 1 more dumpling than females, so the males must have eaten 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings each.  The total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 x 4 = 32.  Females each ate 3 dumplings, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 x 3 = 18.  In total, 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings were eaten.  Since there were no leftovers, that means the total number of dumplings cooked is 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's start by noting that the females ate a total of 6 x 3 = 18 dumplings.  Each male ate one more dumpling than each female, so the males ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.  With 8 males, they ate a total of 8 x 4 = 32 dumplings.  In total, the group ate 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings.  Since there were no leftovers, the number of dumplings Larry cooked is 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's first calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by males.  There are 8 males and each male ate 1 more dumpling than a female.  Since each female ate 3 dumplings, we can say each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.  There are 8 males, so the total number of dumplings eaten by males is 8 x 4 = 32. 

Each female ate 3 dumplings, and there are 6 females, so the total number of dumplings eaten by females is 6 x 3 = 18. 

In total, they ate 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.  Since there were no leftovers, this is the total number of dumplings Larry cooked.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's start by finding the total number of dumplings eaten.  Males eat 1 more dumpling than females, so we need to find the total number of dumplings eaten by females to find the total number of dumplings eaten by males.  Each female ate 3 dumplings, so 6 females together would eat 3 x 6 = 18 dumplings.  Then, each male eats 1 more dumpling than each female, so each male eats 4 dumplings.  The 8 males ate 4 x 8 = 32 dumplings.  The total number of dumplings eaten is 18 + 32 = 50.  The number of dumplings cooked is the same as the number eaten because there were no leftovers.  So, the answer is 50.

 Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2, so $60 went to Gerald and $40 went to Julia.   Gerald had $60 and spent $10 on a book.  So he has $60 - $10 = $50 left.   The answer is 50. 
 Gerald and Julia have a total of 100 dollars.  If they divided the money in the ratio 3:2, that means Gerald had 3 parts and Julia had 2 parts.  3 + 2 = 5 parts.  100 divided by 5 is 20.  So Gerald had 20 * 3 = 60 dollars.  After spending 10 dollars on a book, he had 60 - 10 = 50 dollars left.  The answer is 50. 
 Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2.  This means Gerald got 3/5 of the money and Julia got 2/5 of the money.  Since Julia's part is 2/5 of $100, that is 2/5 * 100 = 2 * 20 = $40.  So Gerald's part is 3/5 of 100, which is 3/5 * 100 = 3 * 20 = $60.  Gerald spent $10 on a book, so he had $60 - $10 = $50 left.  The answer is 50. 
 Gerald and Julia shared the money in a ratio of 3:2.  This means that for every 3 parts Gerald got, Julia got 2 parts.  Since they shared $100, Gerald's portion would be 3/5 of $100, and Julia's portion would be 2/5 of $100.  3/5 of $100 is 0. 6 x $100 = $60.  Then Gerald spent $10 on a book, so he had $60 - $10 = $50 left.  The answer is 50 dollars. 
 Gerald and Julia had 100 dollars.  The ratio is 3:2, so we divide 100 into 3 parts and 2 parts, each corresponding to how many shares Gerald and Julia have respectively.  100 divided by 5 is 20.  Gerald had 3 parts, so he has 20 * 3 = 60 dollars.  Then he spent 10 dollars on a book, so he has 60 - 10 = 50 dollars left.  The answer is 50. 
1.  First, we need to find how much Gerald and Julia got initially.  Since the ratio is 3:2, Gerald got 3x and Julia got 2x, where x is some amount (let's assume x is 20).  So Gerald got 3x = 3 * 20 = 60 dollars and Julia got 2x = 2 * 20 = 40 dollars.  They got 60 + 40 = 100 dollars in total.  

2.  Gerald got 60 dollars.  He spent 10 dollars on a book.  So he has 60 - 10 = 50 dollars left. 
The answer is 50.

[EXP] 306: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Martha's cat can run 15 feet per second.  Since the cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, the turtle is 15 / 5 = 3 feet per second.  In 40 seconds, the turtle will crawl 3 x 40 = 120 feet.  The answer is 120. 
 Martha's cat can run 15 feet per second.  If the turtle is 5 times slower than the cat, then the turtle runs 15 / 5 = 3 feet per second.  In 40 seconds, the turtle will run 40 x 3 = 120 feet.  The answer is 120. 
 Martha's cat runs 15 feet/second.  If the cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, then the turtle runs 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second.  If the turtle runs for 40 seconds, it will crawl 3 x 40 = 120 feet.  The answer is 120. 
15 feet/second is the speed of Martha's cat.  Since the turtle is 5 times slower, the turtle's speed is 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second.  To find how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply 3 feet/second by 40 seconds, which is 3 * 40 = 120 feet.  The answer is 120. 
 If Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, that means the turtle can run 1/5 as fast as the cat.  The cat can run 15 feet/second.  The turtle can run 15 / 5 = 3 feet/second.  If the turtle crawls for 40 seconds, it can crawl 3 * 40 = 120 feet.  The answer is 120. 
 Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle.  The cat can run 15 feet/second.  So, the turtle can run 15 / 5 feet/second = 3 feet/second. 

The turtle crawls for 40 seconds.  So it crawls 3 x 40 = 120 feet.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's start by figuring out how fast the turtle can run.  Since the cat is 5 times faster, and the turtle is slower, we know the turtle's speed is 1/5 as fast as the cat's.  15 * (1/5) = 3, so the turtle can run 3 feet/second.  Now, we know the turtle can run 3 feet/second, but we need to find out how many feet it can run in 40 seconds.  To do that, we multiply its speed by the number of seconds: 3 * 40 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem: Martha's cat's speed, and the turtle's speed relative to the cat's speed. 

From the problem, we know Martha's cat's speed is 15 feet per second.  We are also told that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle.  So, the turtle's speed will be 15 divided by 5, which is 3 feet per second. 

We are also asked to find how much the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.  To do this, we can multiply the turtle's speed by the number of seconds: 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet.  The answer is 120.

[EXP] 307: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 9, [output]: 6300 dollars are the firefighters' goal.  2100 dollars have already been raised in the first 3 hours.  So they need 6300 - 2100 = 4200 more dollars.  

Since the amount raised is the same in every hour, we divide 4200 by the amount raised per hour, which is 700 (2100 / 3 = 700).  

4200 / 700 = 6.  

The firefighters need to fundraise for 6 more hours to reach their goal.  The answer is 6. 
 The firefighters are trying to raise 6300 dollars.  So far they have raised 2100 dollars in the first 3 hours.  So they have 6300 - 2100 = 4200 dollars left to raise.  To figure out how many hours they need to raise this amount, we need to divide 4200 by the amount they make per hour. 

In total hours, the amount they make per hour is 2100 / 3 = 700.  So they make 700 dollars per hour.  Now we can divide 4200 by 700 to find out how many hours they need to raise 4200 dollars. 

4200 / 700 = 6.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 310: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3000, [output]:  The ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  So in 48 hours, they will make 100 * (48/2) = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.  Also, they can make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  So in 48 hours, they can make 50 * (48/4) = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.  In total, they will make 600 + 2400 = 3000 quarts.  The answer is 3000. 
 An ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  So, in one hour, it can make 100 / 2 = 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream.  In 48 hours, it can make 48 * 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream.  48 * 50 = 2400 quarts.   It also makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  So, in one hour, it can make 50 / 4 = 12. 5 quarts of vanilla ice cream.  In 48 hours, it can make 48 * 12. 5 quarts of vanilla ice cream.  48 * 12. 5 = 600 quarts.  In total, it will make 2400 + 600 quarts of ice cream.  2400 + 600 = 3000.  The answer is 3000. 
100 quarts of chocolate ice cream are made in 2 hours.  That means that in 1 hour they make 50 quarts (100 / 2).  Similarly, they make 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  In 1 hour they make 12. 5 quarts of vanilla ice cream (50 / 4).  So in 1 hour they make 50 + 12. 5 = 62. 5 quarts.  In 48 hours they make 62. 5 x 48 = 3000 quarts in total.  The answer is 3000. 
 The ice cream factory can make 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  To find out how many quarts it makes per hour, we do 100 ÷ 2 = 50 quarts per hour.  For chocolate ice cream. 

For vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.  To find out how many quarts it makes per hour, we do 50 ÷ 4 = 12. 5 quarts per hour. 

In 48 hours, the factory can make (48 hours) × (50 quarts/hour) = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream. 
In 48 hours, the factory can make (48 hours) × (12. 5 quarts/hour) = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream. 
So, in total, it would make 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts in 48 hours.  The answer is 3000. 
 The ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.  That means in 48 hours, the factory can make 24 times more, because 48/2 = 24.  So it can make 24 * 100 = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream. 

The factory also makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  To find how many quarts can be made in 48 hours, we can divide 48 by 4, which is 12.  Then we multiply 12 by 50, which is 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream. 

In total, the factory will make 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream and 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours.  2400 + 600 = 3000.  The answer is 3000. 
 An ice cream factory makes a certain amount of ice cream in a certain amount of time.  To find the speed at which it makes ice cream, we need to divide the amount it makes in that time.  Then we can multiply this speed by how many hours we want to know.  Let's do it for both types of ice cream and then we can add them together. 

For chocolate ice cream, it makes 100 quarts in 2 hours, which means it can make 100 / 2 = 50 quarts per hour.  And in 48 hours, it will make 48 * 50 = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream. 

For vanilla ice cream, it makes 50 quarts in 4 hours, which means it can make 50 / 4 = 12. 5 quarts per hour.  And in 48 hours, it will make 48 * 12. 5 = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream. 

Combining the two, in 48 hours it will make 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts of ice cream.  The answer is 3000.

In total, Marcus owes 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50 dollars.  Since he has a loyalty card, his total bill is 10% less.  10% of 50 is 5. 00.  50 - 5. 00 is 45. 00.  The answer is 45. 
 Marcus buys 5 croissants at $3. 00 each.  5 * 3. 00 = 15 dollars.  He buys 4 cinnamon rolls at $2. 50 each.  4 * 2. 50 = 10 dollars.  He buys 3 mini quiches at $4. 00 each.  3 * 4. 00 = 12 dollars.  He buys 13 blueberry muffins at $1. 00 each.  13 * 1. 00 = 13 dollars.  In total he spends 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50 dollars. 

Marcus gets 10% off.  10% off of 50 is 50 * 0. 10 = 5 dollars.  So his total bill is 50 - 5 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
5 croissants * $3 = 15, 4 cinnamon rolls * $2. 5 = 10, 3 mini quiches * $4 = 12, 13 blueberry muffins * $1 = 13.  The total bill before discount is 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50.  Since Marcus has a 10% discount, he will get 10% off the total bill.  50 * 0. 10 = 5.  So he has a 5 dollar discount.  The final bill will be 50 - 5 = 45 dollars.  The answer is 45. 
 Marcus started by finding the total cost of all the items:

Croissants: 5 x $3 = $15. 00
Cinnamon Rolls: 4 x $2. 50 = $10. 00
Mini Quiches: 3 x $4 = $12. 00
Blueberry Muffins: 13 x $1 = $13. 00
Total before discount: $15. 00 + $10. 00 + $12. 00 + $13. 00 = $50. 00

Marcus receives a 10% discount on the total bill, which can be found by multiplying the total bill by 0. 10:

$50. 00 x 0. 10 = $5. 00
The discount is $5. 00.  To find the total cost, subtract the discount from the total bill:

$50. 00 - $5. 00 = $45. 00
The answer is 45. 
1.  Calculate the total cost of the items before any discounts. 
   - 5 croissants at 3 dollars each = 5 x 3 = 15
   - 4 cinnamon rolls at 2. 50 each = 4 x 2. 5 = 10
   - 3 mini quiches at 4 dollars each = 3 x 4 = 12
   - 13 blueberry muffins at 1 dollar each = 13 x 1 = 13
   The total before discounts is therefore 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50
   - 10% of 50 = 0. 10 x 50 = 5
   5 dollars is the discount. 
   Marcus' total bill after the discount is 50 - 5 = 45.  The answer is 45.

But she will get 1 free with the deal, so she should only buy 2 scoops and get 1 free.  The answer is 3. 
 Erin has 6 dollars.  Each scoop of ice cream costs 1. 50, so if she buys 1 scoop, she'll have 6 - 1. 5 = 4. 5 left.  If she buys 2 scoops, she'll have 6 - 3 = 3 dollars left.  If she buys 3 scoops, she'll have 6 - 4. 5 = 1. 5 dollars left.  Since the deal is buy 2, get 1 free, she should buy 3 scoops to get 4 scoops for 1. 50*3 = 4. 50.  Only then will she have 6 - 4. 50 = 1. 50 left.

Amy had 100 pieces of candy to start with.  Each day, she eats 3 pieces.  For 14 days, she would have eaten 3 x 14 = 42 pieces.  So she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left. 

To find out how much more Amy has, subtract 44 from 58.  58 - 44 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
 Ginger started with 100 pieces and eats 4 pieces per day.  In two weeks, that is 14 days, so she ate 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.  So she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces.  

Amy also started with 100 pieces.  She eats 3 pieces per day.  In two weeks, that is 14 days, so she ate 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.  So she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.  

To find out how much more Amy has, we subtract Ginger's amount from Amy's amount: 58 - 44 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
 Ginger and Amy both had 100 pieces of Halloween candy initially.  Ginger ate 4 pieces a day, so for 14 days she ate 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.  Amy ate 3 pieces a day, so for 14 days she ate 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.  

Amy had 100 - 42 = 58 pieces after a week, whereas Ginger had 100 - 56 = 44 pieces after a week. 

Amy had 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces of candy after two weeks.  The answer is 14.

2/3 of 36 is 24.  Mr.  Boarden needs mosaic tiles for 24 sq ft.  Each sq ft requires 24 tiles, so for 24 sq ft it requires 24 * 24 = 576.  The answer is 576. 
2/3 of 36 sq ft is 36 * 2/3 = 24 sq ft.  Now, we need to find out how many mosaic tiles he would need for that area.  For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles.  So for 24 sq ft, he needs 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.  The answer is 576. 
36 sq ft is the total area of the bathroom.  For every square foot, he needs 24 mosaic tiles.  So for 36 sq ft, Mr Boarden needs 36 * 24 = 864 mosaic tiles. 

Two thirds of 36 sq ft is 36 * (2/3) = 24 sq ft.  For 24 sq ft, Mr Boarden needs 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.  The answer is 576. 
36 sq ft bathroom and 2/3 of it is covered is the same as finding 36 * 2/3 = 24 sq ft.  Mr.  Boarden needs 24 tiles per sq ft.  So for 24 sq ft, he needs 24 * 24 tiles.  24 * 24 = 576.  The answer is 576. 
2/3 of 36 sq ft is 24 sq ft (to find this, multiply 2/3 x 36 = 0. 67 * 36 = 24. 67 and round down to 24, since you can't have a fraction of a square foot). 

For each square foot, Mr.  Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles.  So for 24 sq ft, he would need 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.  The answer is 576. 
 *Two-thirds of 36 sq ft is 36 x 2/3 = 24 sq ft.  For every square foot, Mr Boarden needs 24 tiles.  So for 24 sq ft, he needs 24 times that, which is 24 * 24 = 576 tiles.  The answer is 576.

So he paid 20 + 45 = 65 dollars.  To buy the same amount at the store, it would have cost him 2. 5 x 30 = 75 dollars.  So he saved 75 - 65 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 James started with a $20 cost to go picking blueberries.  Then he paid $1. 5 per pound.  For 30 pounds, he paid 30 x 1. 5 = 45 dollars in addition to the $20.  So in total he paid 45 + 20 = 65 dollars.  To buy at the store, it would have cost 30 x 2. 5 = 75 dollars.  The difference is 75 - 65 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
 It cost $20 to go picking blueberries.  Then, it cost $1. 5 per pound to pick the blueberries.  For 30 pounds, the cost is 30 x $1. 5 = $45.  So in total, it cost $20 + $45 = $65.  Instead, if he had bought the blueberries at the store for $2. 5 per pound, it would have cost 30 x $2. 5 = $75.  So he saved $75 - $65 = $10.  The answer is 10. 
 First, calculate the cost of James picking blueberries:

Cost of going to the blueberry patch: $20
Cost per pound: $1. 5
Total amount of blueberries picked: 30 pounds
Total cost of picking: $20 + 30 x $1. 5 = $20 + $45 = $65

Now, calculate the cost of buying the same amount of blueberries at the store:

Total amount of blueberries: 30 pounds
Cost per pound: $2. 5
Total cost of buying at the store: 30 x $2. 5 = $75

Now, calculate the difference in cost:

Cost of buying at the store: $75
Cost of picking: $65
Amount saved: $75 - $65 = $10

The answer is 10. 
 First, James spent $20 to go blueberry picking.   Then, he picked 30 pounds of blueberries for $1. 5 per pound.  30 * 1. 5 = 45, so he spent $45 more for the blueberries.  $20 + $45 = $65 in total.  He could have bought the blueberries at the store for $2. 5 a pound.  30 * 2. 5 = 75.  So he could have spent $75.  $75 - $65 is $10.  The answer is 10.

	* Ham: 2 oz x 40 calories per oz = 80 calories

2.  Next, add up the calories from each ingredient:
	* 450 (eggs) + 240 (cheese) + 80 (ham) = 770 calories

So, the total number of calories in the omelet is 770.  The answer is 770. 
 Let's break it down step by step! 

1.  The omelet has 6 eggs, and each egg is 75 calories.  So the total calories from eggs is 6 x 75 = 450 calories. 

2.  The cheese is 2 oz and is 120 calories per ounce.  So the total calories from cheese is 2 x 120 = 240 calories. 

3.  The ham is also 2 oz and is 40 calories per ounce.  So the total calories from ham is 2 x 40 = 80 calories. 

4.  Add up the calories from eggs, cheese, and ham to get the total number of calories in the omelet.  450 + 240 + 80 = 770. 

The answer is 770. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  

Eggs: Eggs are 75 calories each.  For a 6-egg omelet, that's 6 x 75 = 450 calories. 

Cheese: There are 2 oz of cheese.  Cheese is 120 calories per ounce, so that's 2 x 120 = 240 calories. 

Ham: There is an equal amount of ham to cheese, which is 2 oz.  Ham is 40 calories per ounce, so that's 2 x 40 = 80 calories. 

Total calories: Eggs + Cheese + Ham = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories. 

The answer is 770. 
 Let's first calculate how much each ingredient contributes to the total calories. 
Each egg contributes 75 calories.  Since there are 6 eggs, the total calorie contribution from eggs is 6 * 75 = 450. 
Cheese contributes 120 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces.  So, the total calorie contribution from cheese is 2 * 120 = 240. 
Ham also contributes 40 calories per ounce, and there are 2 ounces.  So, the total calorie contribution from ham is 2 * 40 = 80. 
Now, we add up the total calorie contribution from all three ingredients: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770.  The answer is 770.

Each sack has 25 kilograms of rice.  So the total weight is 25 * 7 = 175 kilograms. 

The answer is 175. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Goldy starts with 20 sacks of rice.  She gives 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother.  So, the total number of sacks given away is 3 + 4 = 7. 

The amount of rice per sack is 25 kilograms, so the total amount of rice she had initially is 20 x 25 = 500 kilograms. 

The amount of rice she gave away is the amount in the sacks given away multiplied by the amount per sack: 7 x 25 = 175 kilograms. 

The answer is 175. 
20 sacks were bought initially.  Then 3 sacks were given to her cousin and 4 sacks were given to her brother.  So the total sacks given away are 3 + 4 = 7.  We just need to find out the weight of these sacks, which is 25 kilograms per sack.  The total weight of rice given away is:

With her arms raised, her combined rate is 200 + 200 = 400 times per minute.  She did this for 2 out of 5 minutes, so that is 2 x 400 = 800 times her arms were raised.  The remaining 3 minutes were not arms raised.  So 3 x 550 = 1650.  Total combined taps is 800 + 1650 = 2450 times.  The answer is 2450. 
 Helga starts by tapping 300 taps on the right foot and 250 taps on the left foot per minute.  This means she is tapping a total of 550 taps every minute.  When her arms are raised, she taps at a rate of 200 taps per minute with each foot.  This means she is tapping 200 taps on each foot, so a total of 400 taps per minute.  But for only 2 of those 5 minutes, her arms are raised.  So during these 2 minutes, she taps 2 x 400 = 800 taps.  Since she taps at 550 taps per minute for the other 3 minutes, this is a total of 3 x 550 = 1650 taps.  In total, she tapped 800 + 1650 = 2450 taps.  The answer is 2450.

[EXP] 323: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 255, [output]: 450 is the amount of damage the pothole will do to his car.  120 is the fine he will receive if he fixes it.  3 buckets of asphalt at 25 dollars each is 3 * 25 = 75 dollars.  So if he fixes the pothole, he will spend 120 + 75 = 195 dollars.  Since he would have spent 450 dollars if he didn't fix it, he will save 450 - 195 = 255 dollars.  The answer is 255. 
 Fixing the pothole will cost Ron 25 * 3 = 75 dollars for the buckets of asphalt, plus 120 dollars for the fine, which totals to 195 dollars.  This will save Ron from having to pay 450 dollars in car damage.  450 - 195 = 255 dollars that Ron will save.  The answer is 255. 
 Ron's car will get damaged for 450 dollars.  He will save that much money if he fixes it himself.  But he will pay 120 dollars fine, as well.  He will also buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each for 25 dollars.  So that is 3 x 25 = 75 dollars.  So he will save 450 - 120 - 75 dollars by fixing the pothole himself.  450 - 120 - 75 is 255.  The answer is 255. 
 Ron will spend $450 if the pothole is not fixed. 
 Ron will also spend $120 for the fine if it is fixed. 
 To fix the pothole, he needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each, which is 3 x 25 = 75. 
 So the total cost of fixing the pothole is 120 + 75 = 195. 
 Therefore, he save $450 - 195 = 255 by fixing the pothole himself. 
 The answer is 255. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  

Ron will have to spend:
- 3 buckets of asphalt at 25 dollars each: 3 x 25 = 75 dollars
- Fine for doing road maintenance: 120 dollars

Total cost for Ron if he fixes it himself is: 75 + 120 = 195 dollars

The amount of damage to his car is: 450 dollars

Ron would save: 450 - 195 dollars

450 - 195 is 255

Ron saves 255 dollars if he fixes the pothole.  The answer is 255. 
450 dollars is the damage the pothole will do to Ron's car if it's not fixed.  If it costs 120 dollars to fix it, and 3 bucks of asphalt cost 25 dollars each, that's 3 x 25 = 75 dollars for the asphalt.  So the total cost of fixing the pothole would be 120 + 75 = 195.  By not fixing it and paying the 450 dollars to his car, Ron will actually LOSE 450 - 195 = 255 dollars.  The answer is 255.

[EXP] 325: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many slices of pizza were ordered.  Each friend, including Bryce, ordered one pizza.  Since there were 5 friends in total, that's a total of 5 pizzas.  Each pizza had 12 slices, so the total number of slices ordered is 5 * 12 = 60 slices. 

Next, let's see how many slices were eaten.  Two friends, including Bryce, ate 2/3 of their pizzas.  This means 2/3 of 12 slices, or (2/3) * 12 = 8 slices per friend.  Since there were 2 friends, that's a total of 8 * 2 = 16 slices eaten. 

The other two friends ate ¾ of their pizzas, which is (3/4) * 12 = 9 slices per friend.  Since there were 2 friends, that's a total of 9 * 2 = 18 slices eaten. 

Now, let's add up the number of slices eaten: 16 + 18 = 34 slices. 

That means 60 - 34 = 26 slices of pizza were left.  The answer is 26. 
1 pizza \* 12 slices = 12 slices.  There were 5 people (Bryce and 4 friends).  5 pizzas \* 12 slices = 60 slices.  The 3 friends Bryce ate 2/3 of their pizzas each.  3 \* 2/3 = 2.  So the 3 friends ate 2 pizzas.  Each of those 2 pizzas have 2/3 of 12 slices = 8 slices each.  So the 3 friends ate 8 + 8 = 16 slices.  The 2 remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas each.  Each of those 2 pizzas have 3/4 of 12 slices = 9 slices each.  So the 2 friends ate 9 + 9 = 18 slices.  So in total, the friends ate 16 + 18 = 34 slices of pizza.  60 - 34 is 26.  The answer is 26.

30 minutes the cat takes to eat 9 sausages.  The dog eats 9 sausages in 30 * 2/3 = 20 minutes.  To calculate the average, add the time taken by both the cat and the dog and divide it by 2.  30 + 20 = 50.  50/2 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
 The cat eats the sausages in 30 minutes.  The dog eats the sausages in 2/3 of that time.  30 / 3 = 10, so 2/3 of 30 is 20.  So the dog eats in 20 minutes.  The average will be the sum of the times divided by the number of times:

(30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25. 

The answer is 25. 
 The cat eats sausages in 30 minutes.  A dog can eat the same number of sausages in 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.  So to find the average time, we need to add the time it takes them both to eat the sausages and divide by 2:

(30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25

The average time it takes both of them to eat the sausages is 25 minutes.  The answer is 25. 
 First, find the time the dog takes to eat the sausages.  The cat eats sausages in 30 minutes.  The dog takes 2/3 of that time to eat the same number of sausages.  So, the dog takes 2/3 x 30 = 20 minutes to eat the sausages. 

Now, find the average time for both the cat and the dog to eat the sausages. 
Average time = (30 + 20) / 2 = 50 / 2 = 25 minutes. 

The answer is 25 minutes.

[EXP] 327: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8-feet and 4-inches, which is 8 * 12 + 4 = 100 inches. 

We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  So, 100 inches = 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes + 10 inches. 

Subtract 10 inches from both sides: 100 - 10 = 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. 
90 = 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. 

Divide both sides by 9: 90 / 9 = the length of one of Bobby's shoes. 
The answer is 10. 
 Since 1 foot is 12 inches, Topher's shoes is 8 feet + 4 inches = 100 inches.  Since one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes, 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 100 - 10 = 90 inches.  Then one of Bobby's shoes must be 90 / 9 = 10 inches.  The answer is 10. 
8-feet and 4-inches is 8 * 12 + 4 = 100.  Note that the length of Topher's shoe is given in inches.  Now, Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  So, if Topher's shoe is 100 inches, 100 - 10 = 90 inches must be 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe.  90 / 9 = 10.  The length of Bobby's shoe is 10 inches.  The answer is 10. 
 Let's convert Topher's shoe length to inches.  1 foot is 12 inches, so 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches.  Adding 4 inches to that, Topher's shoe length is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.  We are told this is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  So we can write the equation:

100 inches = 9 x (x) + 10

where x is the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  To solve for x, subtract 10 from both sides:

90 inches = 9 x x

Then, divide both sides by 9:

10 inches = x

So one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.  The answer is 10.

So Hannah smashes 64 + 48 = 112 windows.  The answer is 112. 
64 students' cars with 4 windows each makes a total of 64 x 4 = 256 windows.  A quarter of these windows is 256 / 4 = 64.  For the teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, making a total of 32 x 2 = 64 windows.  A three-fourths of these is 64 x 3/4 = 48 windows.  In total, Hannah smashes 64 + 48 = 112 windows.  The answer is 112. 
64 students' cars with 4 windows each have a total of 64 * 4 = 256 windows.  A quarter of that is 256 * 0. 25 = 64 windows, which is the number of student cars' windows Hannah smashes.

Three quarters of that is 64 * 0. 75 = 48 windows, which is the number of teachers' cars' windows Hannah smashes.  64 + 48 = 112.  The answer is 112. 
64 students' cars with 4 windows each means there are a total of 64 * 4 = 256 student windows.  A quarter of them, or 256 * 1/4 = 64, are smashed.  For the teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so 32 * 2 = 64 total teacher windows.  Three quarters of them, or 64 * 3/4 = 48, are smashed.  

In total, 64 student windows and 48 teacher windows are smashed.  That's 64 + 48 = 112 windows smashed.  The answer is 112. 
 Let's break this down step by step.  

First, we need to find the total number of windows of students' cars.  There are 64 students' cars, and each has 4 windows, so we multiply 64 x 4 = 256 windows.  

Next, we need to find the total number of windows of teachers' cars.  There are 32 teachers' cars, and each has 2 windows, so we multiply 32 x 2 = 64. 

Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows, which means she smashes 1/4 x 256 = 64 windows of students' cars.  

She also smashes 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows, which means she smashes 3/4 x 64 = 48 windows of teachers' cars. 

In total, she smashes 64 + 48 = 112 windows.  The answer is 112. 
64 students' cars with four windows each means there are 64 x 4 = 256 windows to the students' cars.  3/4 of the teachers' cars' windows means 3/4 * 64 windows to the teachers' cars, which is 48 windows. 

Smashing the windows, she smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4 of the teachers' cars' windows.  So she will smash 256/4 = 64 windows of student cars and 48 windows of teacher cars.  64 + 48 = 112.  The answer is 112.

[EXP] 329: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools in total.  Out of 60 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools total, the percent of blue spools is 60 / 150 = 0. 4 = 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
15 + 45 is 60 spools of blue thread.  60 is what percent of 15 + 45 + 40 + 50? To find what percent, divide 60 by the total and multiply by 100.  60 / 150 is 0. 4.  0. 4 * 100 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
15 light blue spools + 45 dark blue spools = 15 + 45 = 60 blue spools in total. 

Candy has a total of 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools. 

To find the percentage of blue spools, divide the number of blue spools by the total spools:

60 blue spools / 150 total spools = 0. 4 = 40%

So, 40% of her spools are blue.  

The answer is 40. 
15 dark blue spools of thread, 45 dark blue spools of thread, together is 15 + 45 = 60.  60 blue threads out of 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools.  So the percentage of blue spools is 60 / 150 = 0. 40.  0. 40 * 100 = 40%.  The answer is 40%. 
15 light blue and 45 dark blue spools of thread are the total blue spools.  Light blue are 15 spools.  Dark blue are 45 spools.  Total blue spools are 15 + 45 = 60. 

Total spools are 15 light blue + 45 dark blue + 40 light green + 50 dark green = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150. 

The total blue spools are 60.  And the total spools are 150.  To calculate the percentage of blue spools:

(Blue spools / Total spools) * 100 = (60/150) * 100 = 0. 4 * 100 = 40%

So, 40% of the spools she has are blue.  The answer is 40%.

[EXP] 335: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Cindy's math and science books weigh 2 pounds each, so 2 + 2 = 4 pounds for both of these books.  Her French book weighs 4 pounds.  Her English book weighs 3 pounds.  Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, so 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.  In total, all the books weigh 4 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 17 pounds.  The answer is 17. 
 Let's start by identifying the weight of each book:

* Math book: 2 pounds
* Science book: 2 pounds
* French book: 4 pounds
* English book: 3 pounds
* History book: 6 pounds (twice the weight of the English book)

Now, we need to find the total weight of the books Cindy is carrying.  To do this, we simply add up the weights of all the books:

2 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds

The answer is 17. 
 Cindy has 2 math and science books.  Each of them weighs 2 pounds, so they weigh 2 x 2 = 4 pounds together.  Her French book weighs 4 pounds.  Her English book weighs 3 pounds.  Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book, which is 3 x 2 = 6 pounds.  Adding them up, the total weight of her books is 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
 Cindy has math and science books that weigh 2 pounds each.  She has one math book and one science book, so that is 2 + 2 = 4 pounds.  Her French book weighs 4 pounds and her English book weighs 3 pounds.  Her history book weighs 3 * 2 = 6 pounds (since it is twice as much as her English book).  The total weight of the books she is carrying is 4 + 4 + 3 + 6.  We can add these up as follows: 4 + 4 is 8, then 8 + 3 is 11, and finally 11 + 6 is 17.   The answer is 17. 
 Cindy has a math and science book.  Each one weighs 2 pounds.  So she has 2 x 2 = 4 pounds of math and science books. 

She also has a French book, which weighs 4 pounds. 

The English book weighs 3 pounds. 

Her history book weighs twice as much as her English book.  The English book weighs 3 pounds, so the history book weighs 3 x 2 = 6 pounds. 

Adding up the weight of all the books, the total weight is 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
 Let's start by finding the weight of the history book.  It weighs twice as much as the English book, which weighs 3 pounds.  So, the history book weighs 3 x 2 = 6 pounds. 

We know the math and science books weigh 2 pounds each.  Since there are two of them, their total weight is 2 x 2 = 4 pounds. 

Then, there's the French book weighing 4 pounds and the English book weighing 3 pounds.  Let's add these up: 4 + 3 = 7 pounds. 

Adding the weights of all the books together, we have:
4 (math and science) + 6 (history) + 7 (French and English) = 17 pounds.

[EXP] 336: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 20% of 100 votes is 20% * 100 = 20 votes.  Candidate B got 50% more than 20 votes, so they got 20 + (50/100) * 20 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  That leaves 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes for candidate C.  The answer is 50. 
20 percent of 100 is 20.  50 percent more than 20 is 30.  So candidate A got 20 votes, candidate B got 30 votes, and candidate C got the remaining votes.  In total, candidate A and B got 20 + 30 = 50 votes.  100 - 50 = 50 votes was given to candidate C.  The answer is 50. 
20% of 100 votes is 20.  Candidate B got 50% more than candidate A, so candidate B got 30 votes (20 x 1. 5).  That's a total of 20 + 30 = 50 votes for A and B.  There were 100 votes altogether, so candidate C got the remaining votes, which is 100 - 50 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's solve this step by step. 

Candidate A got 20% of the votes, which is:

20% of 100 = 0. 20 x 100 = 20 votes

Candidate B got 50% more votes than Candidate A, which is:

20 votes + 50% of 20 votes = 20 votes + 0. 5 x 20 votes = 20 votes + 10 votes = 30 votes

Candidate C got the rest of the votes, which is the total votes minus the votes given to A and B:

100 votes - 20 votes - 30 votes = 50 votes

So, Candidate C got 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
20% of 100 is 20 votes.  If candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, that means B got 20 * 1. 5 = 30 votes.  There were 100 voters total.  If A and B got 20 and 30 votes, then the rest is 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
20% of 100 votes is 20, since 20/100 = 0. 2.  Since candidate B got 50% more votes than A, candidate B got 20 + 20 x 0. 5 = 20 + 10 = 30 votes.  There are a total of 100 votes.  The rest of the votes are given to candidate C.  So, candidate C got 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes.  The answer is 50. 
20% of 100 is 20 votes for candidate A. candidate B got 50% more votes than candidate A, so they got 1. 5 x 20 = 30 votes.  In total, candidate A and candidate B got 20 + 30 = 50 votes.  Since there are 100 voters, candidate C got the remaining 100 - 50 = 50 votes.  The answer is 50.

32 ounces of water.  Peter has 3 giant cubes that require 4 ounces each so 3 x 4 = 12 ounces are used.  He has 7 medium cubes that require 2 ounces each so 7 x 2 = 14 ounces are used.  He has 8 small cubes that require 0. 5 ounces each so 8 x 0. 5 = 4 ounces are used.  In total, 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces are used.  32 - 30 = 2 ounces are left.  The answer is 2. 
32 ounces is the total amount of water Peter starts with.  3 giant cubes with 4 ounces each will use up 3 x 4 = 12 ounces.  7 medium cubes with 2 ounces each will use up 7 x 2 = 14 ounces.  8 small cubes with 1/2 ounce each will use up 8 x 1/2 = 4 ounces.  The amount of ounces used in total is 12 + 14 + 4 = 30.  32 - 30 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
32 ounces of water started with Peter.  For giant cubes, he used 4 ounces per cube, and made 3 cubes.  So that is 4 * 3 = 12 ounces used.  For medium cubes, he used 2 ounces per cube, and made 7 cubes.  So that is 2 * 7 = 14 ounces used.  For small cubes, he used 1/2 ounce per cube, and made 8 cubes.  So that is 1/2 * 8 = 4 ounces used.  12 + 14 + 4 is 30.  So 30 ounces of water was used, leaving 32 - 30 = 2 ounces of water.  The answer is 2. 
32 ounces is the starting amount of water.  For making giant cubes that use 4 ounces per cube, he made 3 of them.  So 3 * 4 = 12 ounces were used.  For medium cubes that use 2 ounces, he made 7 of them.  So 7 * 2 = 14 ounces were used.  For small cubes that use 1/2 ounce, he made 8 of them.  So 8 * 0. 5 = 4 ounces were used.  12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces were used in total.  After using 30 ounces, 32 - 30 = 2 ounces are left.  The answer is 2. 
32 ounces of water. 

We make 3 giant cubes.  Each giant cube uses 4 ounces of water.  So we used 3 x 4 = 12 ounces for giant cubes. 

We make 7 medium cubes.  Each medium cube uses 2 ounces of water.  So we used 7 x 2 = 14 ounces for medium cubes. 

We make 8 small cubes.  Each small cube uses 1/2 an ounce of water.  So we used 8 x 1/2 = 4 ounces for small cubes. 

In total we used 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces.  So we have 32 - 30 = 2 ounces left.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's calculate the total number of ounces used up first.  For the giant cubes, they use 4 ounces each, and he made 3 of them.  3 x 4 = 12 ounces.  For the medium cubes, they use 2 ounces each, and he made 7 of them.  7 x 2 = 14 ounces.  For the small cubes, they use 0. 5 ounces each, and he made 8 of them.  8 x 0. 5 = 4 ounces.  In total, he used up 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. 

Peter started with 32 ounces.  He used up 30 ounces, so he has 32 - 30 = 2 ounces left.  The answer is 2. 
_gettime P flux 32 ounces.  We can find how much water is used by the different sizes of cubes.  For the giant ice cubes, 4 ounces are used per cube, so 3 giant cubes use 4 x 3 = 12 ounces.  For medium cubes, 2 ounces are used per cube, so 7 medium cubes use 2 x 7 = 14 ounces.  For small cubes, 0. 5 ounces are used per cube, so 8 small cubes use 0. 5 x 8 = 4 ounces.  In total, 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces were used.  Since Peter started with 32 ounces, 32 - 30 = 2.  The answer is 2.

Now we can calculate how many more books Clara has than Alice.  Clara has 20 books and Alice has 16 books, so Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice. 
The answer is 4.

[EXP] 340: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 98, [output]:  A half-gallon jar costs 2 dollars less than a gallon jar.  So a half-gallon jar costs 5 - 2 = 3 dollars.  Cecelia bought 16 half-gallon jars, so that will cost 16 * 3 = 48 dollars.  She also bought 10 gallon jars, which cost 10 * 5 = 50 dollars.  In total, she spent 48 + 50 = 98 dollars.  The answer is 98. 
 A gallon jar is 2 dollars more than a half-gallon jar.  So a half-gallon jar costs 5 - 2 = 3 dollars. 
For the 10-gallon jars: 5 x 10 = 50 dollars. 
For the 16 half-gallon jars: 3 x 16 = 48 dollars. 
Total spent = 50 + 48 = 98 dollars.  The answer is 98. 
 Cecelia went to the store and bought 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.  She knows a gallon jar costs 5 dollars and a half-gallon jar costs 5 - 2 = 3 dollars.  For the 10 gallon jars, it will cost 10 x 5 = 50 dollars.  For the 16 half-gallon jars, it will cost 16 x 3 = 48 dollars.  To find the total amount of money she spent, add the cost of the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars: 50 + 48 = 98 dollars.  The answer is 98.

[EXP] 341: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 50 students are in the class.  10 like to bake, so that leaves 50 - 10 = 40 left.  5 like to play basketball, so that leaves 40 - 5 = 35 left.  The number that like to play music is twice the number that prefer playing basketball, so 2 x 5 = 10 like to play music.  So, the remaining number that like to play video games is 35 - 10 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
50 students, 
10 students like to bake.  That leaves 50 - 10 = 40 students.  
5 like to play basketball.  The number of students that like to play music is twice that.  5 x 2 = 10.  So 10 students like to play music.  That leaves 40 - 10 - 5 = 25 students.  The answer is 25. 
50 - 10 = 40 students like something other than baking.  These students like to either play video games, play music, or play basketball.  So, 40 - 5 = 35 like to play video games or play music.  If the number of music students is twice the basketball students, then the number of music students is 5 * 2 = 10.  This means there are 35 - 10 = 25 video game players.  The answer is 25.

[EXP] 343: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 80 students are divided into 2 classes, so each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students.  If 40% of the students in each class are girls, that means 40% of 40 = 0. 4 x 40 = 16 girls in each class.  To find the number of boys in each class, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of students in each class.  So, 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 students are in both classes.  That means 80/2 = 40 students in each class.  40% of students are girls, which means 40% of 40 = 0. 4 x 40 = 16 girls in each class.  So, there are 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 is the total number of students.  Each class has the same number of students, so divide 80 by 2 to get 40 students in each class.  

In each class, 40% of the students are girls.  To find 40% of 40, multiply 40 by 0. 4 = 16.  So 16 students are girls in each class.  

40 students in each class minus 16 girls in each class means there are 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
 Let's start by finding the total number of girls in the two classes.  80 students in total and each class has the same number of students, so each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students.   40% of 40 is 40 x 0. 4 = 16 students are girls.   There are 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.   The answer is 24. 
 Let's think about it step by step.  If there are 2 classes with the same amount of students, we can divide the total students (80) by 2 to get the number of students in each class.  80 ÷ 2 = 40. 

Now, we know that 40% of the students in each class are girls.  This means that 60% of the students are boys.  To find the number of boys in each class, we can calculate 60% of 40. 

40 x (60/100) = 24

So, there are 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
 Let's solve this problem step by step. 

There are 80 students in total in both classes. 

40% of the students in each class are girls.  So, 40% of the total students are girls, and the remaining are boys. 

Let's find out how many girls are in each class:

40% of the total students are girls.  To find 40% of 80, we can multiply 80 by 0. 4:

80 x 0. 4 = 32

So, there are 32 girls in each class. 

Now, let's find the number of boys in each class:

There are 80 students in total, and 32 girls in each class.  To find the total number of boys, subtract the number of girls from the total number of students:

80 - 32 = 48

So, there are 48 boys in total.  Since the classes have the same number of students, there are 48/2 = 24 boys in each class. 

The answer is 24. 
40% of the students in each class are girls.  60% of them are boys.  
Let's find out how many students are in each class.  There are 80 students total and each class has the same number of students, so we can divide 80 by 2 to find the number of students in each class.  80 / 2 = 40. 
There are 40 students in each class.  40% of the students are girls.  That means 40% of 40 students are girls.  40% of 40 is 40 x 0. 4 = 16. 
Since 16 students are girls, the rest of the students are boys.  There are 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
80 students in total, and 40% of the students in each class are girls.  That means 60% are boys. 

In each class, the number of students are equal.  Let's call the number of students in each class "n".  So, there are "n" girls and "n" boys in each class.  The total number of students is 80. 
n + n = 80
2n = 80
n = 40

So, each class has 40 students.  40% of 40 are girls, which is 0. 4 * 40 = 16.  So, each class has 16 girls. 

In each class, the number of boys is 40 - 16 = 24. 
The answer is 24.

 Mara started with 2 slices of cake.  She added 3 more.  2 + 3 = 5.  She tripled the number of slices she had, which is 5 x 3 = 15.  Then she ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.  Then her friend stole 5 slices, leaving her with 13 - 5 = 8 slices.  The answer is 8. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Initially, the plate had 2 slices of cake. 

Mara added 3 more slices, so the total number of slices became 2 + 3 = 5 slices. 

Then, Mara tripled the number of slices, so 5 slices became 5 x 3 = 15 slices. 

After eating 2 slices, she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices left. 

However, while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate.  So, she had 13 - 5 = 8 slices remaining on the plate. 

The answer is 8. 
 Mara started with 5 slices on the plate (3 added + 2 slices already there).  Then she tripled the slices, so she had 5 * 3 = 15 slices.  After eating 2 slices, she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices.  Her friend stole 5 slices, so 13 - 5 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
3 slices are added to the 2 slices that were already on the plate, so there are now 3 + 2 = 5 slices.  Then she tripled the number of slices, so 5 x 3 = 15 slices in total.  After eating 2 slices, she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices left.  When her friend stole 5 slices, she had 13 - 5 slices left.  13 - 5 is 8.  The answer is 8. 
 Let's break this down step by step.  Mara added 3 slices of cake to the plate, so the plate now has 2 + 3 = 5 slices.  Then, she tripled the number of slices she had, which means she added 5 x 2 = 10 more slices to the plate.  So now the plate has 5 + 10 = 15 slices.  Then, Mara ate 2 slices, leaving her with 15 - 2 = 13 slices.  During this time, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate.  13 - 5 = 8.  The answer is 8.

He also made 50 x 30 = 1500 dollars from the 30 cards.  So, his total profit is 5000 + 1500 = 6500.  Since he spent 5400 dollars, his profit is 6500 - 5400 = 1100.  The answer is 1100. 
 Mark started by spending 1800 for 3 packs.   That is a total of 1800 * 3 = 5400 dollars.   After selling the 2 high valued cards worth 4000 and 1000 dollars, he made 4000 + 1000 = 5000 dollars.   Then there are 30 more cards worth an average of 50 dollars each.   30 * 50 = 1500.   So he made 1500 more dollars from those cards.   The total money he made is 5000 + 1500 dollars.   This is 6500 dollars.   So he made 6500 - 5400 = 1100 dollars in profit.   The answer is 1100. 
 Mark spent 3 * 1800 dollars buying packs.  So 3 * 1800 = 5400 dollars.  It seemed like there is some stuff he didn't mention, about the 1 card worth 4000 and 1 worth 1000, and some other cards worth 50 each.  So let's first see how much money he earned from those cards: 4000 + 1000 + 50 * 30 = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500.  So he earned 6500.  How about the money spent? 5400 was spent.  And 6500 was earned.

For the second amusement park, for the two adults, it would be 2 x 14 = 28.  For the two children, it would be 2 x 10 = 20.  In total, the cost would be 28 + 20 = 48. 

The difference between the two costs is 76 - 48 = 28.  The answer is 28. 
 First, we need to find the total cost for the first amusement park.  For 2 adults and 2 children, the cost is 2 * 26 + 2 * 12 = 52 + 24 = 76. 

Then, we need to find the total cost for the second amusement park.  For 2 adults and 2 children, the cost is 2 * 14 + 2 * 10 = 28 + 20 = 48.

He used to buy them for $. 5 each.  So he paid 3500 * . 5 = 1750 dollars a week.  Now he buys them for $. 4 each.  So he pays 3500 * . 4 = 1400 dollars a week.  He saved 1750 - 1400 = 350 dollars a week.  The answer is 350. 
 The tomato vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes a day for $. 5 each, so it cost him 500 * 0. 5 = 250 dollars per day.   Since he buys from the new vendor for 0. 4 dollars per tomato, it will now cost him 500 * 0. 4 = 200 dollars per day. 

He will save 250 - 200 = 50 dollars per day.  Since there are 7 days in a week, he will save 50 * 7 = 350 dollars a week. 

The answer is 350. 
 The tomato vendor starts with 7 days in a week.  He sells 500 tomatoes each day and that is 500 * 7 = 3500 tomatoes in a week.  He used to buy each tomato for $. 5.  So in a week, he would spend 3500 * 0. 5 = 1750 dollars.  Now, he buys each tomato for $. 4.  So in a week, he will spend 3500 * 0. 4 = 1400 dollars.  The difference is 1750 - 1400 = 350 dollars.

[EXP] 350: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students will be separated into 6 groups.  That means 54 / 6 = 9 students will be in each group.  If the activity needs 12 groups, but there are only 6 groups so far, then 12 - 6 = 6 more groups are needed.  The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into groups of equal size.  We can first find the size of each group by dividing 54 by 6:
54 ÷ 6 = 9

So, each group has 9 students. 

The activity requires 12 groups, but 54 students are only enough for 6 groups of 9 students each.  So, we need more groups.  To find out how many more groups are needed, we can subtract the number of groups that are formed initially (6) from the total number of groups required (12):
12 - 6 = 6

The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  To find the size of the groups, we divide the number of students by the number of groups: 54 ÷ 6 = 9.  So each group has 9 students. 

If the activity requires 12 groups, we need to form 12 groups.  Since each group has 9 students, to find the total number of students in all groups, we multiply 12 (the number of groups) by 9 (the number of students per group): 12 x 9 = 108.  In this case, there are already 54 students, so to get to 108, we need to add 54 - 108 = 54 students.  Since we need to form groups to accommodate these new students, we need 54 ÷ 9 = 6 more groups.  The answer is 6. 
54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  If the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find the extra groups needed. 

First, we find how many students are in each group if 6 groups are formed: 54/6 = 9 students per group. 

Then, we find the total number of students needed for 12 groups: 12 x 9 = 108 students. 

Since there are originally 54 students, we need more students to form the 12 groups.  To find the difference, we subtract 54 from 108: 108 - 54 = 54. 

Since we need to find the number of groups, we can then divide the difference (54 students) by 9 students per group: 54/9 = 6. 

So, 6 more groups are needed to form the original 12 groups.  The answer is 6.

She rents out 100 chairs per day for the 2 weekend days.  100 * 2 = 200 chairs per week.  
So every week, Candy rents out 300 + 200 = 500 chairs.  
For a 4-week month, she will rent out 500 chairs per week * 4 weeks.  500 * 4 = 2000 chairs per month.  
In 2 months, she will rent out 2000 chairs per month * 2 months.  2000 * 2 = 4000 chairs.  The answer is 4000. 
5 days a week, 60 chairs are rented.  So, 5 * 60 = 300 chairs are rented. 

2 weekends in a week means 2 * 100 = 200 chairs are rented. 

So, in a week, 300 chair will be rented during the weekdays and 200 chairs will be rented during weekends.  Total chairs in a week = 300 + 200 = 500. 

There are 4 weeks in a month.  So, in a month, the total chairs rented = 500 * 4 = 2000. 

There are 2 months.  So, the total chairs rented in 2 months = 2000 * 2 = 4000. 

The answer is 4000.

4 roommates and an electricity bill of 100 dollars each month means that the total electricity bill per year will be 12 * 100 = 1200 dollars.  To find out how much each roommate will pay, we have to divide the total bill by the number of roommates.  1200 / 4 = 300.  The answer is 300. 
 There are 4 roommates originally.  Each month the electricity bill is 100 dollars.  So, in a year (12 months), the total electricity bill will be 100 * 12 = 1200 dollars.  To find out how much each roommate will pay, we'll divide 1200 by 4.  1200 / 4 is 300.  The answer is 300 dollars. 
4 roommates share the electricity bill.  Each month it costs 100 dollars.  So for one year, the bill would be 12 x 100 = 1200 dollars.  If they divide it equally, Jenna and her roommates will each pay 1200/4 = 300 dollars.  The answer is 300. 
1st, we need to find the total electricity bill for the year.  It is 100 dollars per month.  There are 12 months in a year.  So the total electricity bill for the year is 100 * 12 = 1200 dollars. 

2nd, we need to find out who pays for it.  Jenna has 4 roommates.  To divide the bill equally among the roommates, we divide the total bill by 4. 

4 roommates divide 1200 dollars equally, which is 1200 / 4 = 300.  The answer is 300 dollars per year per roommate.

[EXP] 354: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 128, [output]: 1 dozen is 12, so 8 dozen glasses is 8 x 12 = 96 glasses.  4 dozen plates is 4 x 12 = 48 plates.  Jeff has 96 glasses and 48 plates.  When 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken, he had 96 - 10 = 86 glasses and 48 - 6 = 42 plates.  The answer is 86 glasses and 42 plates. 
8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates were initially sent.  One dozen means 12, so 8 dozen glasses is 8 x 12 = 96 glasses.  4 dozen plates is 4 x 12 = 48 plates.  So originally, Jeff had 96 glasses and 48 plates. 

When 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates, 96 - 10 = 86 glasses and 48 - 6 = 42 plates.  The answer is 86 glasses and 42 plates.

[EXP] 355: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 89, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers.  She trades 90% of them for large buttons.  To find 90% of 30, multiply 30 by 0. 9, which is 27.  So she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. 

Next, she has 40 large stickers.  She trades 50% of them for large buttons, which is 40 x 0. 5 = 20.  The rest of her large stickers, 40 - 20 = 20, she trades for small stickers. 

Now, let's count the number of large buttons she has.  From the small stickers, she got 27 large buttons.  From the large stickers, she got 20 large buttons.  So in total, she has 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons. 

To find the number of small buttons she has, we need to consider the large buttons and small stickers she got.  She traded the small stickers for large buttons, but we'll count the large buttons as small buttons since each large button is worth three small buttons.  From the large stickers, she got 1 large button and 3 small buttons.  So, she got 3 small buttons.  From the small stickers traded for large buttons, she got 3 small buttons for each of the 27 large buttons, which is 27 x 3 = 81 small buttons.  In total, she has 81 + 3 = 84 small buttons. 

Adding up the large buttons and small buttons, we get 47 + 84 = 131 buttons.  The answer is 131.

[EXP] 357: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 people are on the council.  The number of votes for the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it.  Let's say the number of votes against it is X.  Then the number of votes for it is 2X. 

The total number of votes is the sum of votes for and against, so we can set up the equation:

X + 2X = 33

Combine like terms:

3X = 33

Divide by 3:

X = 11

So there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  The number of votes for it is 2X = 2(11) = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people on the council is the total number.  So the number of votes in favor of the new regulation + the number of votes against the new regulation = 33. 

The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were votes against it.  So if we call the number of votes against the new regulation "x", the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x. 

2x + x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

So there were 11 votes against the new regulation.  Since the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice that, there were 2x = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation. 

The answer is 22. 
33 is the total number of people on the council.  The number of votes against the regulation is the number of people who voted against, which is x.  The number of votes in favor of the regulation is 2x, since it was twice as many as the number of votes against.  So, the total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, which is x + 2x = 33.  Simplifying, 3x = 33, so x = 11.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 2x, or 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
 The vote passed, so the sum of the votes for and against the new regulation is the total number of council members, which is 33.  The number of votes against the regulation is x.  The number of votes for the regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so that's 2x.  The total is 33.  We can set up the equation:
x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:
3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:
x = 11

So there were 11 votes against the regulation.  The number of votes in favor of the regulation is twice that, which is 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people were on the council.  There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it.  So let's say X is the number of votes against.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2X. 

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against: 2X + X = 3X. 

The total number of votes is also equal to the number of council members, which is 33. 

So we can set up the equation: 3X = 33

To solve for X, we can divide both sides by 3:

X = 33 / 3
X = 11

The number of votes against is 11.  The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice that, which is:

2X = 2*11
2X = 22

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is 22.  The answer is 22. 
33 people are on the council.  The number of votes in favor of the regulation is twice the number against it.  Let's call the number of votes against the regulation x.  Since the vote passed, we know that the number of votes in favor is more than the number against.  So, the votes in favor is x + x = 2x, which is greater than the number against, x.  We also know that the total number of votes is 33, so x + 2x = 33.  Simplifying, 3x = 33.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 11.  The number of votes against is 11.  The number of votes in favor is 2x, which is 2 * 11 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
 The council has 33 members, so let's say there were x votes against the regulation.  Then, there would be 2x votes in favor.  The sum of the votes would be the total number of members, so x + 2x = 33.  We can combine x and 2x by adding the coefficients, so 3x = 33.  Then, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x: x = 33 / 3, x = 11.  So there were 11 votes against the regulation.  Since there are twice as many votes in favor, there are 2x = 2(11) = 22 votes in favor.  The answer is 22.

[EXP] 358: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 11 students need size extra-small.  Twice as many need size small as extra small, so 11 x 2 = 22 students need size small.  Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.  Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.  Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large. 

So Krissa needs shirts for:
11 (extra small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75

The answer is 75. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

* 11 students need extra-small shirts. 
* Twice as many students need small shirts as extra small, so it's 2 x 11 = 22 students. 
* Four less than the number of size small students need medium, so it's 22 - 4 = 18 students. 
* Half as many students need large as medium, so it's 0. 5 x 18 = 9 students. 
* Six more students need extra-large shirts than large, so it's 9 + 6 = 15 students. 

Now, let's add up the total number of shirts:
11 (extra small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 shirts

The answer is 75. 
 Let's start by calculating the number of sizes needed for each type:

* Extra-small: 11
* Small: Twice as many as extra-small, so 11 x 2 = 22
* Medium: 4 less than the number of size small, so 22 - 4 = 18
* Large: Half as many as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9
* Extra-large: 6 more than the number of size large, so 9 + 6 = 15

Then we add up the total number of shirts needed:

11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75

The answer is 75. 
11 students need size extra-small.  Twice as many students need size small, which is 2 x 11 = 22 students.  4 less than the number of size small students need size medium is 22 - 4 = 18 students.  Half as many students need size large as size medium is 18 / 2 = 9.  6 more students need size extra-large than large means there are 9 + 6 = 15 students that need size extra-large.  In total, Krissa ordered (11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15) shirts.  Through order of operations, we first add the old numbers: 11 + 22 = 33, then 33 + 18 = 51, then 51 + 9 = 60, then 60 + 15 = 75.  The answer is 75.

5% of 140 is (5/100) * 140 = 7 dollars.  The discount is 7 dollars, so the price after the discount is 140 - 7 = 133 dollars.  The answer is 133. 
5% discount off $140 would be (5/100) * 140 = $7.  Then, subtract the discount from the original price: $140 - $7 = $133.  The answer is 133. 
 The bag is marked 140 dollars.  A 5% discount means 5/100 of the original price, which is 5% * 140 = 7.  So the discount is 7 dollars.  You will pay 140 - 7 = 133 dollars.  The answer is 133. 
5% is like saying 1/20, so 5% of 140 is 1/20 x 140 = 7.  So the discount is 7 dollars.  If the original price is 140, we subtract the discount, 140 - 7 = 133.  The answer is 133. 
5% means 5/100 which can be simplified to 1/20.  To find the discount, multiply the original price by the discount percentage: 140 * (1/20) = 7. 

NOW we subtract the discount from the original price to get the final price:
140 - 7 = 133.

[EXP] 364: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's start by breaking down the information given:

* Total number of cases needed: 250
* First house: x
* Second house: 2x (since it needs half of the second house)
* Third house: 2x (since it needs double the first house)

Since the first, second, and third houses make up the total of 250 cases, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

5x = 250

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 50

Now that we know the value of x, we can find the number of cases needed for the third house:

Third house: 2x = 2(50) = 100

The answer is 100 cases of shingles will be needed for the third house. 
250 cases of shingles will be needed in total.  The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so if the second house needs "x" cases, the first house needs 1/2"x" cases, and 1/2"x" + x + 2*(1/2"x") = 250.  We can combine like terms to get 2. 5*x" = 250.  Then divide both sides by 2. 5, and we get "x" equal to 100.  The first house needs 1/2 of the second house, so the first house needs 100/2 = 50 cases.  The third house needs double the first house, so it needs 2*50 = 100 cases.  The answer is 100.

45% more pears than bananas means that the number of pears is equal to the number of bananas plus 45% of the number of bananas.  Let's find the number of pears: number of pears = number of bananas + 45% of number of bananas

Let's convert the percentage to a decimal: 45% = 0. 45

Now let's find the number of pears: number of pears = 200 (bananas) + 0. 45 x 200
= 200 + 90
= 290

Since the question asks for the total number of fruits, add the number of pears to the number of bananas: 200 (bananas) + 290 (pears) = 490

The answer is 490. 
45% more pears than bananas means that if George has x bananas, he has x + 0. 45x = 1. 45x pears.  George has 200 bananas.  So, he has 1. 45x = 200.  To find x, we divide both sides by 1. 45 to get x = 138. 66.  He has 138. 66 bananas.  To find out how many pears he has, we multiply by 1. 45 and get 200 bananas + (200 * 1. 45) = 200 + 290 = 490.  The answer is 490. 
45% more pears than bananas means that the number of pears is 45% greater than the number of bananas.  Let's find the number of pears by calculating 200 + (45/100 * 200).  
First, calculate 45/100 * 200 = 45/1 * 2 = 90.  Now add 90 to 200: 200 + 90 = 290.  So Geoge has 290 pears.  In total, he has 200 bananas and 290 pears, which is 490 fruits.  The answer is 490.

[EXP] 367: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Marissa started with 80 dollars.  She bought a ball for 20 dollars.  So she has 80 - 20 = 60 dollars left.  The rest of the money she used to buy candy bars.  Each candy bar costs 5 dollars.  To find out how many candy bars she bought, we can divide the remaining money by the cost of one candy bar: 60 / 5 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Marissa had 80 dollars.  She used 20 dollars to buy the ball.  So she had 80 - 20 = 60 dollars left.  Each candy bar costs 5 dollars.  To find out how many candy bars she can buy, we divide 60 by 5:
60 ÷ 5 = 12

Marissa can buy 12 candy bars with her remaining 60 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
 Marissa starts with $80.  She buys a ball for $20, so she is left with 80 - 20 = 60 dollars.  She uses the rest to buy candy bars for her brother Jimmy, which cost $5 each.  She has 60 dollars left so she can buy 60 / 5 = 12 candy bars.  The answer is 12. 
 Marissa had 80 dollars.  She bought a ball for 20 dollars, so she had 80 - 20 = 60 dollars left.  She used the rest of the money to buy candy bars for 5 dollars each.

[EXP] 369: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 675, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many books Ahmed has read.  Since Ezra read 2 times as many books as Ahmed, if Ezra read 300 books, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.  After Ezra reads 150 more books, he will have read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books.  Ahmed has already read 150 books.  In total, they have read 450 + 150 = 600 books.  The answer is 600. 
 If Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in 1 hour, and he read 300 books, then Ahmed must have read half of that, or 150 books.  Ezra then decided to read 150 more books.  So in total, they have read 300 + 150 + 150 = 600 books.  The answer is 600. 
 Ezra read 300 books.  Ahmed read half as much as Ezra, which is 300 / 2 = 150 books.  They read 300 + 150 = 450 books together so far.  They plan to read 150 more, so in total they will have read 450 + 150 = 600 books.  The answer is 600. 
 Let's start by identifying what we know.  Ezra has read 300 books and decided to read 150 more.  So Ezra will have read a total of 300 + 150 = 450 books. 

Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, Ahmed must have read half of the number of books Ezra read.  Half of 300 is 150, so Ahmed has read 150 books. 

To find the total number of books they have read altogether, we add the number of books Ezra has read to the number of books Ahmed has read: 450 + 150 = 600 books.  The answer is 600. 
 Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, if Ahmed has read x books, Ezra has read 2x books.  We know Ezra read 300 books, so 2x = 300 => x = 150.  Ahmed has read 150 books.  Now, Ezra reads 150 more, so total books read by Ezra is 300 + 150 = 450.  Total books read by both Ezra and Ahmed is 450 + 150 = 600.  The answer is 600. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  First, we know that Ezra read 300 books this hour.  We also know that Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, so Ahmed must have read half of Ezra's books.  300 / 2 is 150, so Ahmed has read 150 books this hour. 

Now, let's add up the number of books Ahmed and Ezra have read.  Ahmed has read 150 books, and Ezra has read 300 + 150 = 450 books.  So together, they have read 150 + 450 = 600 books.  The answer is 600. 
 {Let's first find out how many books Ahmed read.  Since Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour, Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.  Ezra read 300 books in one hour, and then 150 more, so she read 450 books.  To find out how many books they read in total, we add 150 + 450 = 600.  The answer is 600.

He has 25 ears of corn left.  So, he needs to make 135 - 60 dollars with the corn.  135 - 60 is 75 dollars.  He needs 75 dollars from the corn.  75 / 25 is 3.  So he needs to sell each ear of corn for 3 dollars.  The answer is 3. 
 Bennet sells the 20 eggplants for 3 dollars each.  3 x 20 = 60 dollars.  So now Bennet has 135 - 60 = 75 dollars left to make from the 25 ears of corn.  Bennet needs to make 75 dollars.  To find out how much each ear of corn should be sold for, divide the 75 dollars by the 25 ears of corn.  75 ÷ 25 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
 Bennet sells 20 eggplants for 3 dollars each, so he earns 20 x 3 = 60 dollars.   He wants to make 135 dollars in total.   That means 135 - 60 = 75 dollars more to make.   He has 25 ears of corn.   75 divided by 25 ears of corn is 3.   So he should sell each ear of corn for 3 dollars.   The answer is 3. 
 Let's first figure out how much Bennet made from selling the eggplants.  20 eggplants for 3 dollars each will make 20 x 3 = 60 dollars.  So Bennet has already made 60 dollars.  He wants to make a total of 135, so he needs to make 135 - 60 = 75 more dollars from selling the ears of corn.  He has 25 ears of corn, so he needs to make 75 / 25 per ear of corn.  75 divided by 25 is 3.  The answer is 3. 
 Bennet sold 20 eggplants for 3 dollars each.  So he made 20 x 3 = 60 dollars from the eggplants.  From now on, we're only considering the computers and working our way backward.  We know Bennet wants to make a total of 135 dollars after selling the eggplants and the ears of corn.  So if he wants to make 135 dollars, it means he should make 135 - 60 = 75 dollars from the corn.  He has 25 ears of corn.  So each ear should make 75 / 25 = 3 dollars.  The answer is 3.

If she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, she spends 1/3 of 9 hours on video games.  9 / 3 = 3 hours on video games.  Then she spends the rest of the time on soccer.  9 - 3 = 6 hours on soccer.  So soccer is 6/12 = 1/2 or 50%.  The answer is 50%. 
7 + 5 = 12 hours in total.  After reading for 3 hours, there are 12 - 3 = 9 hours left.  She plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time.  1/3 of 9 is 3.  So, she played video games for 3 hours.  

Total hours of video games and reading is 3 + 3 = 6.  Total hours spent on non-soccer activities is 6 hours.  
12 - 6 = 6 hours are left for soccer.  
Percentage of weekend spent on soccer is (6/12) * 100%. 
The answer is 50%. 
7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, in total that is 7 + 5 = 12 hours.  She reads for 3 hours, so that leaves 12 - 3 = 9 hours.  If she plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time, then that is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.  So she plays video games for 3 hours, leaving 9 - 3 = 6 hours to spend on soccer.  Since she is allocating her time between soccer, video games, and reading, then 6 hours of 12 hours is the total dedicated to soccer.  6 / 12 as a percentage is 50%.  The answer is 50%.

Jack spent 6 hours at the museum.  So he is gone from home for 4 hours to drive + 6 hours at the museum = 10 hours.  The answer is 10. 
 Jack drives to the museum at 75 mph, so it takes him 150 miles / 75 mph = 2 hours to get there.  That's a round trip of 2 x 2 = 4 hours.  Add 6 hours at the museum.  4 + 6 = 10 hours.  The answer is 10. 
 Jack needs to drive from home to the museum which is 150 miles away, and then back home.  So that is a round trip of 150 + 150 = 300 miles.  He drives at 75 mph.  So he will spend 300 / 75 = 4 hours driving there and back.  He spent 6 hours at the museum.  4 (for the drive) + 6 (at the museum) = 10 hours.  The answer is 10. 
 Let's break this problem into parts.  

First, let's find out how long it takes Jack to drive to the museum and back.  He drives 75 mph and the distance is 150 miles there and back, which is 2 x 150 = 300 miles.  To find the time, we divide the distance by the speed: 300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours.  

Now, Jack spent 6 hours at the museum.  To find out the total time he was gone, we add the travel time to the time he spent at the museum: 4 hours (travel) + 6 hours (museum) = 10 hours.  The answer is 10.

57 cars will require 57 x 4 = 228 wheels.  73 motorcycles will require 73 x 2 = 146 wheels.  So he will need a total of 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.  He has 650 wheels originally.  650 - 374 is 276 wheels left.  The answer is 276. 
57 cars and 73 motorcycles need to be assembled.  Each car needs 4 wheels, so that's 57 * 4 = 228 wheels needed for cars.  Each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, so that's 73 * 2 = 146 wheels needed for motorcycles.  In total, he needs 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.  He has 650 wheels, so the number of wheels left if he uses all the needed wheels is 650 - 374 = 276.  The answer is 276. 
57 cars will need 57 * 4 = 228 wheels and 73 motorcycles will need 73 * 2 = 146 wheels.  So in total, 228 + 146 wheels will be needed.  That is 374 wheels.  We are given that there are 650 wheels originally.  After using 374 wheels, the remaining number of wheels is 650 - 374 = 276.  The answer is 276. 
 Let's calculate the total number of wheels needed to assemble all the toys.

[EXP] 377: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 800, [output]: 20% of $1000 = 0. 2 x 1000 = 200.  So the discount is 200.  We need to subtract this from the original price.  1000 - 200 = 800.  The answer is 800. 
20% of $1000 is calculated by multiplying 0. 2 x 1000 = 200.  So the discount is $200.  To find the price after the discount, subtract the discount from the original price.  $1000 - $200 = $800.  The answer is 800. 
20% discount means you get a discount of 20/100 or 1/5 of the price.  1000 divided by 5 is 200.  So the discount is 200 dollars.  1000 - 200 is 800.  The answer is 800. 
1000 - 20% of 1000. 

First, find 20% of 1000.  This is the same as finding 0. 2 x 1000, which is 200.  So the discount is 200. 

To find the new price, subtract the discount from the original price: 1000 - 200 = 800. 

The answer is 800. 
20% of 1000 is 1000 * 0. 2 = 200.  The discount is 20%.  The amount you have to pay is the original amount minus the discount.  1000 - 200 = 800.  The answer is 800. 
1000 dollars is the original price.  To find the discount, we need to find 20% of the original price.  To do that, we multiply the price by 20/100 = 0. 20.  1000 x 0. 20 = 200.  This is the discount.  So, the discount is 200 dollars.  The amount we have to pay is the original price minus the discount.  1000 - 200 = 800.  The answer is 800.

These 200 movies cost 6 dollars each.  This is 200 * 6 = 1200 dollars.  The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400.  40% of these are older movies, which is 40% of 400 = 160.  These older movies cost 5 dollars each, so that's 160 * 5 = 800 dollars.  The remaining regular movies are 400 - 160 = 240.  These movies cost 10 dollars each, so that's 240 * 10 = 2400.  Adding all the costs, 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.  The answer is 4400 dollars. 
1/3 of the 600 movies are in series and can be bought together for $6, so 600/3 = 200 movies.  200 movies at $6 each will cost 200 x 6 = 1200.  So we subtract this from the total cost for the movie collection.  600 - 200 = 400 movies are remaining. 

40% of 400 movies are older movies.  To find 40%, you do 40/100 x 400 = 160.  So 160 movies are older, and each costs $5.  160 x 5 is 800.  The remaining movies are not the series or the older movies, so it is the older movies and the remaining ones we are counting.  We counted the older movies, so 400 - 160 = 240 movies remain. 

These 240 movies are the normal movies that cost $10 each.  So 240 x 10 = 2400.  Add this with the cost for the older movies, 800, and add this with the cost for the series together, 1200.  2400 + 800 + 1200 = 4400.  The answer is 4400.

In total, he spent 12 + 8 + 18 = 38 dollars.  The answer is 38. 
6 pounds of peaches at 2 dollars per pound will be 6 * 2 = 12 dollars.  8 pounds of plums at 1 dollar per pound will be 8 * 1 = 8 dollars.  6 pounds of apricots at 3 dollars per pound will be 6 * 3 = 18 dollars.  To find the total, add 12 + 8 + 18 = 38.  The answer is 38. 
6 pounds of peaches at $2. 00 per pound will be 6 x 2. 00 = 12. 00.  8 pounds of plums at $1. 00 per pound will be 8 x 1. 00 = 8. 00.  6 pounds of apricots at $3. 00 per pound will be 6 x 3. 00 = 18. 00.  In total, Winston spent 12. 00 + 8. 00 + 18. 00 = 38. 00 dollars on fruit.  The answer is 38. 
 Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches and they cost $2. 00 per pound.  So the amount spent on peaches is 6 x 2 = 12 dollars. 

He picked 8 pounds of plums and they cost $1. 00 per pound.  The amount spent on plums is 8 x 1 = 8 dollars. 

He picked 6 pounds of apricots and they cost $3. 00 per pound.  The amount spent on apricots is 6 x 3 = 18 dollars. 

In total, Winston spent 12 + 8 + 18 dollars.  12 + 8 + 18 is 38.  The answer is 38.

[EXP] 380: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 255, [output]: 1.  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

The Llesis family drove for 6 hours at 50 miles per hour.  To find the distance they drove, we multiply the time by the speed:
Distance driven = Time x Speed = 6 hours x 50 miles/hour = 300 miles

The family hiked for 1. 5 hours.  Since they hike at a speed that is 5 miles per hour less than half their drive speed, we need to find half their drive speed.  Half of 50 is 25, and 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour. 

So, the distance they hiked is:
Distance hiked = Time x Speed = 1. 5 hours x 20 miles/hour = 30 miles

To find the distance from their starting point to their vacation spot, we add the distance they drove and the distance they hiked:
Total distance = Distance driven + Distance hiked = 300 miles + 30 miles = 330 miles

The answer is 330 miles.

[EXP] 381: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Let's break down what Ava and Emma will each score.  Ava will get 10 points for 8 more enemies than Emma.  This means Emma jumped on some number of enemies, and Ava jumped on that number plus 8.  Let x be the number of enemies Emma jumped on.  Then Ava jumped on x + 8 enemies.  She will get 10 points for each of those, so she will get 10(x + 8) = 10x + 80 points from jumping on enemies.  Emma will get 10 points for each of the number of enemies she jumped on, so she will get 10x points.  

Ava and Emma both collect berries, and Emma will collect 3 fewer than Ava.  If Emma collects y berries, then Ava collects y + 3 berries.  Ava gets 5 points for each berry, so she gets 5(y + 3) = 5y + 15 points.  Emma gets 5 points for each berry, so she gets 5y points. 

Finally, both Ava and Emma will get 30 points for each second left on the timer.  If Emma has m seconds left, then Ava will have m - 4 seconds left because Ava finished 4 seconds slower.  Ava will get 30 points for each of those seconds, so she will get 30(m - 4) = 30m - 120 points.  Emma will get 30 points for each of her seconds, so she will get 30m points. 

Now we can find Ava's and Emma's total scores.  Ava's score is her points from enemies, her prize berries, and her time bonus.  So it is:

10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30m - 120. 

Emma's score is her points from enemies, her prize berries, and her time bonus.  So it is:

10x + 5y + 30m. 

The difference between their scores is:

(10x + 80 + 5y + 15 + 30m - 120) - (10x + 5y + 30m). 

We can combine like terms:

10x + 80 + 5y + 15 - 120 + 30m - 10x - 5y - 30m. 

This gives us:

65.

[EXP] 382: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]: 4 pizzas will cost 64 dollars.  2 of them cost 30 dollars.  So 64 - 30 = 34 dollars are left.  Since there are 2 pizzas left, they must have each cost 34/2 = 17 dollars.  The answer is 17. 
4 friends ordered 4 pizzas for 64 dollars.  2 of the pizzas cost 30 dollars so 64 - 30 = 34 dollars is left for the other 2 pizzas.  If the pizzas cost the same, that means the cost per pizza is 34 / 2 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
4 pizzas for a total of 64 dollars means the total cost per pizza is 64 ÷ 4 = 16 dollars.  Two pizzas costed 30 dollars, so the remaining 2 pizzas cost 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.  The cost of each of these pizzas is 34 ÷ 2 = 17 dollars.  The answer is 17. 
4 pizzas for 64 dollars.  So, the total cost of 2 pizzas will be 64 - 30 = 34.  34 / 2 = 17.  Each of the other two pizzas will be 17 dollars.  The answer is 17. 
4 pizzas in total cost 64 dollars.  2 of the pizzas cost 30 dollars.  So those 30 dollars account for 30/64 of the total cost.  The other two pizzas must be 64 - 30 = 34 dollars.  They are the same, and 34/2 is 17.  The answer is 17. 
4 pizzas for a total of 64 dollars means that 2 pizzas cost 30 dollars.  So, each of those pizzas cost 30/2 = 15 dollars. 

The other 2 pizzas cost the same amount, so to find the cost of each, we can subtract the cost of the 2 pizzas that are already accounted for: 64 - 30 = 34. 

Then, we divide the remaining cost by 2 to find the cost of each of the other two pizzas: 34/2 = 17. 

The answer is 17.

On 2 other days, they ride twice the usual times, so that's 2 * 2 * 3 = 12 times.  The total number of times they ride their bikes is 15 + 12 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 Chase and Rider ride 3 times a day on 5 days, so that is 5 x 3 = 15 times.  On two other days, they ride 3 * 2 = 6 times each.  So they ride 6 + 6 = 12 times on these two days.  In total, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times a week.  The answer is 27. 
 Chase and Rider can ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days.  So that is 3 x 5 = 15 times.  On two other days, they ride twice as many times, which is 2 x 3 = 6 times per day.  So for 2 days, they ride 2 x 6 = 12 times.  In total, they ride 15 + 12 = 27 times a week.  The answer is 27. 
 Chase and Rider ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days.  That's a total of 5 x 3 = 15 times.  On two other days, they ride twice the times they do on usual days, so that's 6 times each day, or 12 times in total.  In total, they ride their bikes for 15 + 12 = 27 times.  The answer is 27. 
 Chase and Rider can ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, which is 5 x 3 = 15 times.  There are 3 more days, where they ride twice as much (6 times a day).  So, for 2 days, it's 6 x 2 = 12 rides.  15 + 12 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 There are originally 7 days (5 + 2).  For each of the 5 usual days, they can ride their bikes 3 times.  So, 3 * 5 = 15 times in total.  On the 2 days when they ride twice, they ride each 2 * 3 = 6 times.  So, 6 * 2 = 12 times.  In total, they ride their bikes 15 + 12 = 27 times.  The answer is 27.

[EXP] 384: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Bob started with 7 fish, 3 oranges and 4 whites.  After buying more fish, he found that he had twice as many orange as white.  So orange fish = 2 * white fish.  We know that orange fish = 3 + x, where x is the number of orange fish he bought at the store.  3 + x = 2 * (4 + x), so 3 + x = 8 + 2x.  Subtracting x from both sides gives 3 = 8 - x.  Then x = 5.  So Bob bought 5 orange fish at the store.  The number of white fish he bought would be the same, as all fish were mixed in the tank.  The answer is 5. 
17 fish were taken from the tank.  Let's count the orange and white fish.  From the original information, there were 4 white fish and 3 orange fish, so there were 4 + 3 = 7 fish in total.  After adding 17, the total becomes 7 + 17 = 24 fish. 

After putting them home, there were twice as many orange fish as white fish.  Let's say x is the number of orange fish now.  Since there are twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of white fish is x/2. 

The total number of fish now is 24 (since they added 17 fish to 7), and we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 = 24

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x/2 + x/2 = 24
x = 24

So there are 12 orange fish and 12/2 = 6 white fish. 

Bob started with 3 orange fish, so there are 12 - 3 = 9 orange fish that he bought at the store.  Since he bought white and orange fish equally, 9 white fish were also bought.  However, the question asked for the number of white fish bought, not the total.  In the group of 17, the number of white fish that Bob bought is 9 - 4 = 5. 

The answer is 5.

[EXP] 385: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Since the car travels 5 miles each way, each day it travels a total distance of 5 x 2 = 10 miles.  For the entire week, the car would travel 10 miles x 5 days = 50 miles.  Because the car has an efficiency of 10 MPG, it would consume 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas each week.  Since each gallon of gas costs $3, it would cost Andy 5 x $3 = $15 per week.  The answer is 15. 
1 way, Andy drives 5 miles, so 2 way is 5 x 2 = 10 miles.  If he drives 5 days a week, that is 10 * 5 = 50 miles.  To calculate how much fuel is used, it is distance divided by fuel efficiency, which is 50 / 10 = 5 gallons of fuel.  And it costs 3 dollars per gallon, so it consumes 5 * 3 = 15 dollars of fuel each week.

If she spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is 200 * 3/5 = 120, and all the quarters, which is 35, then she spent a total of 120 + 35 = 155 dollars.  The answer is 155. 
 Carrie was given 10 twenties and 140 quarters.  10 twenties means 10 x 20 = 200 dollars.  140 quarters means 140/4 = 35 dollars.  So she had 200 + 35 dollars initially.  She spent all the quarters, which is 35 dollars.  She also spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is 200 x 3/5 = 120 dollars.  In total, she spent 35 + 120 = 155 dollars.  The answer is 155. 
10 twenties means 10 x 20 = 200 dollars.  And 140 quarters is 140 x 0. 25 = 35 dollars.  So Carrie had 200 + 35 = 235 dollars.  She spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 x 200 = 120 dollars.  120 dollars and all 35 dollars from quarters make 120 + 35 = 155.  The answer is 155. 
10 twenties = 10 x 20 = 200 dollars.  140 quarters = 140 / 4 = 35 x 1 = 35 dollars.  35 + 200 = 235 dollars.  She spent 3/5 of the 200 twenties.  200 * (3/5) = 200 * (3/5) = 120 dollars.  So she spent 35 dollars on quarters and 120 dollars on twenties.  35 + 120 = 155.  The answer is 155 dollars. 
 First, let's find the value of the quarters.  There are 25 cents in 1 quarter.  Since Carrie has 140 quarters, the value of the quarters is 140 * 25 cents, which is 3500 cents or 35 dollars.  Now let's find the value of the twenties.  Carrie was given 10 twenties.  Each twenty is 20 dollars.  The value of the twenties is 10 * 20 = 200 dollars.  Since she spent 3/5 of the twenties, she spent 3/5 * 200 = 120 dollars.  Now let's add the cost of the quarters and the twenties.  35 dollars (quarters) + 120 dollars (twenties) = 155 dollars.  The answer is 155.

1/4 of the sales are smart TVs, so 1/4 of 40 = 10 are smart TVs.  1/8 of the sales are analog TVs, so 1/8 of 40 = 5 are analog TVs.  There are 40 TVs in total, and 10 + 5 are smart and analog TVs respectively.  The rest are OLED TVs.  40 - 10 - 5 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
40 TVs in total sold.  One-fourth of 40 is 10 (40 ÷ 4 = 10), so 10 TVs are smart TVs.  One-eighth of 40 is 5 (40 ÷ 8 = 5), so 5 TVs are analog TVs.  To find out how many OLED TVs, we subtract the number of smart TVs and analog TVs from the total: 40 - 10 - 5 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
40 TVs were sold.  Of those, one-fourth are smart TVs, which is 40 ÷ 4 = 10.  One-eighth are analog TVs, which is 40 ÷ 8 = 5.  So 10 + 5 = 15 were either smart TVs or analog TVs.  Since there are 40 TVs, the rest are OLED TVs.  40 - 15 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
40 TVs in total.  1/4 are Smart TVs and 1/8 are Analog TVs.  So, the fraction for Smart and Analog TVs is (1/4) + (1/8) = 3/8.  So, 3/8 of 40 is 15 TVs (15 = 40 * 3/8).  So, the rest, which is the rest of 40 - 15 = 25, are OLED TVs.  The answer is 25. 
1/4 of the TVs are smart TVs.  So that would be 40 * 1/4 = 10 TVs.  1/8 of the TVs are analog TVs.  So that would be 40 * 1/8 = 5 TVs.  We can calculate the total number of non-OLED TVs by adding the smart and analog TVs, which is 10 + 5 = 15 TVs.  The total number of TVs is 40, and we already know how many non-OLED TVs there were, which is 15.  So the number of OLED TVs must be the total minus the non-OLED ones, which is 40 - 15 = 25.  The answer is 25.

[EXP] 389: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  John needs money for a school trip that costs 300 dollars.  Half of it will be covered by the school.  So the school will cover 300 / 2 = 150 dollars.  John needs 300 - 150 = 150 dollars.  He has 50 dollars, so he is missing 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.  The answer is 100. 
50 dollars is what John has.  The school is covering half the cost of the trip.  So the school will pay for 300 / 2 = 150 dollars.  This leaves 300 - 150 dollars for John to pay.  300 - 150 is 150.  So John is missing 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.  The answer is 100. 
 First, we need to find out how much of the cost the school will cover.  If the school covers half the cost, that means it will cover 300 ÷ 2 = 150 dollars.  John already has 50 dollars, so subtract that from the amount the school will cover to find out how much more John needs.  150 - 50 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
 First, let's see how much the school will help cover: half of 300 dollars is 300 / 2 = 150 dollars.  The school will cover 150 dollars.  Now, since John has 50 dollars, he is missing 300 - 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.  The answer is 100. 
 If the school is covering half of the trip, then that means the school is paying for $150 (300 / 2).   Since John only has $50, he is missing $150 - $50 = $100 to pay for the rest of the trip.   The answer is 100.

[EXP] 390: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Since it was 45 degrees during the day, but 33 degrees colder at night, that means the temperature during the night was 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.  We want to get the temperature to at least 32 degrees, so we need to increase it by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.  Each log of wood heats the house by 5 degrees, so we need 20 / 5 = 4 logs of wood.  The answer is 4. 
 Carson's house needs to be kept above 32 degrees to prevent pipes from freezing.  During the day, it is 45 degrees.  At night, it gets 33 degrees colder, so it is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.  So Carson needs to increase the temperature by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.  Each log of wood increases the temperature by 5 degrees.  To increase the temperature by 20 degrees, Carson needs to burn 20 ÷ 5 = 4 logs of wood.  The answer is 4. 
32 degrees is the temperature when the pipes start to freeze.  The current temperature is 45 degrees during the day, but it's 33 degrees colder than that at night.  So the night temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.  To go from 12 degrees to 32 degrees, you need to heat up the house by 20 degrees.  If each log heats up the house by 5 degrees, then you need to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs.  The answer is 4. 
32 degrees is the cut off below which the pipes will freeze.  Since it is 33 degrees colder at night, the temperature at night is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.  Since this is less than the minimum, Carson needs to raise the temperature to 32 degrees.  To do this, Carson will need to burn enough logs to increase the temperature 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.  Each log increases the temperature by 5 degrees, so Carson needs to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs.  The answer is 4. 
32 degrees is the lowest temperature that will not freeze the pipes.  It was 45 degrees during the day, but it's 33 degrees colder at night.  So during the night, the temperature is 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.  We want to make sure the temperature remains above 32 degrees, so we need to warm the house to 32 degrees. 

The temperature difference is 12 - 32 = 20 degrees.  We need to heat the house by 20 degrees.  Every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, so we divide 20 by 5 to find out how many logs we need: 20 / 5 = 4.  The answer is 4.

The answer is 12. 
90 people need to be split into groups.  The groups are 9 people each, so the number of groups is 90 / 9 = 10.  Only 3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells, so only 3/5 * 10 = 6 groups brought back shells.  Each group brought back 2 shells, so in total they brought back 6 * 2 = 12 seashells.  The answer is 12. 
90 people are required to split into groups.  9-person groups are formed.  So the number of groups will be 90 / 9 = 10. 

3/5 of the groups had members bring back seashells.  10 * 3/5 = 6 groups.  These 6 groups brought back 2 seashells each. 

6 * 2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
90 people were required to split into groups.  9-person groups were formed.  So, the number of groups would be 90 / 9 = 10. 

If 3/5 of the number of groups had members who brought 2 seashells each, it means that (3/5) * 10 = 6 groups had members who brought seashells. 

Each of these 6 groups brought 2 seashells each, so the total number of seashells brought is 6 * 2 = 12. 

The answer is 12. 
90 students were in the competition.  9-person groups were formed, so we have to find how many groups we can make with 9 students each.  90 divided by 9 is 10, with a remainder of 0.  So we can make 10 groups. 

Each of 3/5 of the groups brought back 2 seashells.  3/5 of 10 groups is 6 groups.  Each group brought 2 seashells, so we have to find how many seashells they brought.  6 groups x 2 seashells per group = 12 seashells.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 394: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  Jamie earns 20 dollars per hour.  For the first 8 hours of work, she would earn 8 x 20 = 160 dollars.  For the last 3 hours (because 11 - 8 = 3), she would earn 3 x 30 (150% of 20) = 90 dollars.  So in total, she would earn 160 + 90 = 250 dollars.  The answer is 250. 
 Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours, so that is 8 x 20 = 160 dollars.  For the additional 3 hours, she earns 150% of $20 per hour, which is 1. 5 x 20 = 30 dollars per hour.  3 hours for $30 each will be 30 x 3 = 90 dollars.  So in total, she earned 160 + 90 = 250 dollars.  The answer is 250. 
 Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work.  That's $20 * 8 = $160.  She also worked an additional 3 hours at a special rate that is 150% of her regular rate.  So the special rate is 150% * 20 = 30 dollars per hour.  She worked 3 hours at that rate, so she earned 3 * 30 = 90 more dollars.  In total she was paid 160 + 90 = 250 dollars.  The answer is 250. 
 Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20.  If she needs to work additional hours, she gets 150% of that, which is 1. 5 x 20 = 30 dollars.  After working 8 hours at her regular rate, she worked 11 - 8 = 3 hours at her special hourly rate.  At the special rate, she earned 3 x 30 = 90 dollars.  For her regular rate, she earned 20 x 8 = 160 dollars.  In total, she earned 160 + 90 = 250 dollars.  The answer is 250. 
 Jamie's regular hourly rate is 20 dollars.  Since she worked 11 hours total, we need to calculate her earnings first from her regular hours.  8 hours at 20 dollars/hour is 8 x 20 = 160.  For the 3 extra hours, her rate is 150% of 20, which is 30 dollars/hour.  For the extra 3 hours, she earns 3 x 30 = 90.  The total she earned is 160 + 90 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
 Jamie earns $20 per hour for regular work hours.   Since she worked 8 hours, she would have earned $20 * 8 = $160.   Jamie worked 11 hours in total, but the additional 3 hours are at a special rate.   Since this rate is 150%, the hourly rate for extra hours is 1. 5 * 20 = $30.   So the total money she earned from the extra hours is 3 * 30 = $90.   The total amount she earned is $160 (from regular hours) + $90 (from extra hours) = $250.   The answer is 250.

 A zookeeper counts 12 female lions.  Half as many male lions means half of 12, which is 6 male lions.  There are also 14 lion cubs.  So in total there are 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions.  The answer is 32. 
12 female lions are in the enclosure.  Half as many male lions, so 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.  6 male lions, 12 female lions, and 14 lion cubs give a total of 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions.  The answer is 32. 
12 female lions were counted.  Since there are half as many male lions as female lions, there must be 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.  In total, there are 12 female lions and 6 male lions.  Plus, there are 14 lion cubs.  So, in total, there are 12 + 6 + 14 = 32 lions.  The answer is 32. 
12 female lions, then half as many male lions means 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.  There are 14 lion cubs, so add the female, male, and cubs to get the total number of lions.  12 + 6 + 14 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
12 female lions are counted.  Since there are half as many male lions, if the number of male lions is denoted by m, then m = 12/2 = 6.  The zookeeper also counted 14 lion cubs.  So the total number of lions is 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.  The answer is 32.

Each student plants 1 tree, so the students will plant 1000 trees.  Each teacher plants 2 trees, and there are 40 * 3 = 120 teachers in total.  Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the teachers will plant 120 * 2 = 240 trees.  In total they will plant 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.  The answer is 1240. 


There are 40 classes with 25 students each, so there are 40 * 25 = 1000 students.  Each student plants one tree, so that is 1000 trees.  There are 40 classes, and each class has 3 teachers, so there are 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.  Each teacher plants 2 trees, so that is 120 * 2 = 240 trees.  In total, 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees will be planted.  The answer is 1240. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 

First, let's calculate the total number of students and teachers.  There are 40 classes, with 25 students per class, so the total number of students is:

40 classes x 25 students per class = 1000 students

There are also 3 teachers per class, and 40 classes, so the total number of teachers is:

40 classes x 3 teachers per class = 120 teachers

Each teacher plants 2 trees, so the total number of trees planted by teachers is:

120 teachers x 2 trees per teacher = 240 trees

Each student plants 1 tree, so the total number of trees planted by students is:

1000 students x 1 tree per student = 1000 trees

In total, the school will plant:

1000 trees planted by students + 240 trees planted by teachers = 1240 trees

The answer is 1240. 
40 classes with 25 students each means the number of students is 40 x 25 = 1000.  Each student plants 1 tree.  The number of trees students plant is 1000.  There are also 40 x 3 = 120 teachers.  Each teacher plants 2 trees.  The number of trees teachers plant is 120 x 2 = 240 trees.  In total, there are 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees planted.  The answer is 1240 trees. 
 Firstly, we need to calculate the total number of students and teachers.  There are 40 classes, with an average of 25 students per class, so the total number of students is 25 * 40 = 1000.  Each teacher plants 2 trees, and there are 3 teachers per class.  So, the total number of teachers in the school is 3 * 40 = 120, and each teacher plants 2 trees, so 120 * 2 = 240 trees are added from teachers.  Students, on the other hand, each plant 1 tree.  So, 1000 students are planting trees.  Now, let's calculate the number of trees planted at the end.  Originally, they had no trees.  When the students plant 1000 trees, that's 1000 + (-0 = 1000) trees.  Then, 240 more trees are added from teachers, so 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.  The answer is 1240.

The answer is 9. 
7 days a week for half an hour is 7 * 0. 5 = 3. 5 hours.  For 2 weeks, that would be 3. 5 * 2 = 7 hours.  Kris also played 2 hours every day for 1 week.  That is 2 * 7 = 14 hours.  In total, Kris played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.  She needs 30 hours to get the achievement, so she still needs 30 - 21 = 9 hours.  The answer is 9. 
 Kris starts with 0 hours played.  

She plays half an hour every day for 2 weeks, so 14 days.  14 * 0. 5 = 7 hours.  

Then she plays 2 hours every day for a week, so 7 days.  7 * 2 = 14 hours.  

In total, she played 7 + 14 = 21 hours.  She needs 30 - 21 = 9 hours more to earn the achievement.  The answer is 9. 
14 days at 30 minutes per day will be 14 * 30 minutes = 420 minutes = 7 hours.  Then, for the next 7 days, Kris plays 2 hours.  7 + 7 * 2 = 21.  She has played 21 hours in total.  30 - 21 = 9.  She needs to play for 9 more hours to earn the achievement.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 405: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  The first car travels 60 miles in one hour.  So in 2 hours, it travels 60 x 2 = 120 miles.  The second car travels 70 miles in one hour.  So in 2 hours, it travels 70 x 2 = 140 miles.  Since the difference in their distances is 140 - 120 = 20 miles, the cars will be 20 miles apart after 2 hours.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's start by figuring out how far the second car will travel in 2 hours.  It's speed is 70 miles per hour, so in 2 hours it will travel 70 x 2 = 140 miles.  The first car will travel 60 x 2 = 120 miles.  So the difference will be 140 - 120 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's first find the difference in the speed of the two cars.  The first car is going at 60 miles per hour, and the second car is going at 70 miles per hour.  70 - 60 is 10. 

After 2 hours, the first car will have traveled 2 x 60 = 120 miles.  The second car will have traveled 2 x 70 = 140 miles. 

The difference in distance is 140 - 120 = 20 miles. 

The answer is 20. 
 The first car moved 60 miles in the first hour.  The second car moved 70 miles in the first hour.  So the distance between them decreased by 70 - 60 = 10 miles in the first hour.  In the second hour, the first car moved another 60 miles, and the second car moved another 70 miles.  So the distance between them decreased by another 70 - 60 = 10 miles.  The total distance between them is 10 + 10 = 20 miles.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  In 2 hours, it will cover a distance of 60 * 2 = 120 miles. 

The second car, which is traveling at 70 miles per hour, will also cover a distance of 70 * 2 = 140 miles in 2 hours. 

The question asks how many miles will separate them after 2 hours, which means we need to find the difference between their distances: 140 - 120 = 20. 

The answer is 20. 
 Let's consider the relative speed of the two cars.  The second car is passing the first, so the first car is at a relative speed of 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour slower than the second car.  The relative distance between them will increase at a rate of 10 miles per hour. 

To find the distance between them, we need to multiply the relative speed by the time elapsed.  Since there are 2 hours, the distance between them will increase by 10 miles per hour * 2 hours = 20 miles. 

The answer is 20. 
2 cars, 2 cars are driving on a highway.  The first car is traveling at 60 miles per hour and the second car is traveling at 70 miles per hour.  

The difference between their speeds is 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour.  This means that the second car will be 10 miles ahead of the first car after 1 hour.  

Then, the second car will have 10 miles distance ahead, and be traveling at 70 miles per hour, while the first car is also traveling at 60 miles per hour.  So in another hour, the difference between the distance will be 10 + 10 = 20 miles.  

So, the answer is 20.

[EXP] 406: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]:  The cost of the ring is 600 + 300 = 900 dollars.  The premium is 30% of 900, which is 0. 30 * 900 = 270.  So, the total cost of the ring, including the premium, is 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
600 (diamond) + 300 (gold) = 900 (total cost).  Then, a 30% premium on that is 0. 3 x 900 = 270.  900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 James spent $600 on the diamond and $300 on the gold.  The total cost is 600 + 300 = 900.  The premium is 30% of 900.  To find the premium, multiply 900 by 0. 30.  900 * 0. 30 = 270.  So the total amount he paid is 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
600 for the diamond and 300 for the gold is 600 + 300 = 900 dollars for the ring, without the premium.  The premium is 30% of 900 dollars, which is 0. 30 * 900 = 270 dollars.  So James paid 900 + 270 = 1170 dollars.  The answer is 1170. 
600 + 300 is 900.  To calculate the 30% premium, take 30/100 of 900, which is 270.  Add that to the price to get the final total: 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
 First, we have to find the total cost of the ring without the premium.  To do this, we add 600 + 300, which is 900.  Then, we multiply this number by 0. 3 to get the premium, which is 0. 3 x 900 = 270.  Then, we add the premium to the total cost: 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170.

[EXP] 407: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]: 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, so the pass rate for third-graders is 340 / 500 = 0. 68 = 68%.  There are 40 out of 100 fourth-graders passed, so the pass rate for fourth graders is 40 / 100 = 0. 4 = 40%.  The 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, which is 2 * 40% = 80%.  To find the overall pass rate, we need to add up the total number of students and the total number of students who passed.  There are 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students.  The total number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + (0. 8 * 400) = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.  The overall pass rate is 700 / 1000 = 0. 7 = 70%.  The answer is 70%. 
340 out of 500 third-graders passed.  To find the percentage, we can divide 340 by 500 and multiply by 100, which gives us 68% passed. 

For fourth graders, 40 out of 100 passed, which is a pass rate of 40%. 

For fifth graders, the pass rate is twice the fourth-grade rate, which is 80%.  This means that 80% of 400 fifth graders passed, or 0. 8 x 400 = 320 fifth-graders passed. 

To find the total number of students who passed, we add the number of students who passed in each grade: 340 (third grade) + 40 (fourth grade) + 320 (fifth grade) = 700. 

The total number of students who took the test is the sum of the number of students in each grade: 500 (third grade) + 100 (fourth grade) + 400 (fifth grade) = 1000. 

To find the overall pass rate, we divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students who took the test and multiply by 100: (700 / 1000) x 100 = 70%.  The answer is 70%. 
340 out of 500 third graders passed, so the pass rate is 340/500 = 68%.  40 out of 100 fourth graders passed, so the pass rate is 40/100 = 40%.  The pass rate for the 400 fifth graders is twice the fourth grade's pass rate, which is 40%.  So the pass rate for the fifth graders is 2 * 40/100 = 80%.  In total, we need to consider 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000 students.  Out of those, 340 + 40 + (80% * 400) passed.  80% of 400 is 0. 8 * 400 = 320.  So 340 + 40 + 320 passed.  This is a total of 700 passed out of 1000 students.  700 / 1000 = 0. 7 = 70%.  The answer is 70%.

[EXP] 408: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4, [output]:  The first step is to calculate the area of the mosaic that Milo can make with 2 bags of chips.  Each bag has 72 chips, so 2 bags have 72 x 2 = 144 chips.  It takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, so 144 chips can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.  The mosaic is 3 inches tall, so the length of the mosaic is 3 inches times the number of squares it can make.  Since each square is 1 inch square, 12 square inches are 12 inches.  The answer is 12. 
 We know that a bag of glass chips holds 72 chips.  So, Milo has 72 x 2 = 144 chips.  Since it takes 12 chips to make one square inch of the mosaic, Milo can make 144 / 12 = 12 square inches.  Since his mosaic will be 3 inches tall, he can make it 3 inches in height and also 12 inches long (because 12 square inches is 3 x 4 = 12 inches long).  The answer is 12. 
12 glass chips are needed for every square inch.  For every inch, it will take 12 glass chips.  Since he wants the mosaic to be 3 inches tall, that means it will be 3 * 12 = 36 glass chips tall. 

There are 72 chips in one bag.  Milo has 2 bags, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.  Since he needs 36 glass chips tall, he can make a mosaic with a base that is 144 / 12 = 12 inches long. 

The answer is 12. 
 Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall.  It takes 12 glass chips to make every square inch, so it takes 12 x 3 = 36 chips for a square inch.  For a 3-inch tall mosaic, he would need 36 chips for each inch.  36 x 3 = 108 chips, which is more than 2 bags of chips.  2 x 72 chips = 144 chips, so Milo has 144 chips.  This is less than the 108 chips needed, so Milo can make a mosaic that is 144/12 = 12 inches long.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 409: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 10 quarts of tea were left from the party.  4 students drank 1. 5 quarts each, so in total they drank 4 x 1. 5 = 6 quarts.  16 students drank 2 quarts each, so they drank 16 x 2 = 32 quarts.  Total quarts drunk = 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.  Since 10 quarts were left, there were 10 + 38 = 48 quarts at the beginning.  Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, there must have been 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea at the beginning of the party.  The answer is 12. 
4 students drank 1. 5 quarts each, so they drank 4 x 1. 5 = 6 quarts of tea.  16 students drank 2 quarts of tea each, so they drank 16 x 2 = 32 quarts of tea.  In total, they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts of tea. 

Since there are 10 quarts left, that means there must have been 38 + 10 = 48 quarts at the beginning of the party. 

Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we can divide the number of quarts by 4 to get the number of gallons:

48 quarts ÷ 4 = 12 gallons

The answer is 12 gallons. 
16 students drank 2 quarts of tea each, so 2 x 16 = 32 quarts were consumed.  4 students drank 1. 5 quarts each, so 4 x 1. 5 = 6 quarts were consumed.  So a total of 32 + 6 = 38 quarts were consumed.  Since there are 10 quarts left, that means there must have been 10 + 38 = 48 quarts at the beginning.  Since there are 4 quarts in a gallon, we convert 48 to gallons by dividing by 4, so 48 ÷ 4 = 12 gallons.  The answer is 12. 
10 quarts were left after the party.  The students drank the following amount of tea: 4 students * 1. 5 quarts = 6 quarts, and 16 students * 2 quarts = 32 quarts.  So in total, they drank 6 + 32 = 38 quarts.  Since 10 quarts were left, the amount at the beginning must have been 10 + 38 = 48 quarts.  48 quarts is equal to 12 gallons (since 1 quart is equal to 1/4 gallon).  The answer is 12. 
1 gallon = 4 quarts.  Let's first find the total number of quarts of tea drunk:

4 students drank 1. 5 quarts each, so the total is 4 x 1. 5 = 6 quarts. 
16 students drank 2 quarts each, so the total is 16 x 2 = 32 quarts. 
Total quarts drunk = 6 + 32 = 38 quarts. 

There were 10 quarts left, so to find the total number of quarts at the beginning, we add the quarts drunk to the quarts left:
Total quarts at the beginning = 10 + 38 = 48 quarts. 
Converting 48 quarts to gallons, we divide by 4:
48 quarts / 4 = 12 gallons
The answer is 12. 
10 quarts of tea were left after the party.  
The total amount of tea drank by the students were 
4 x 1. 5 = 6 quarts (from 4 students) 
16 x 2 = 32 quarts (from 16 students) 
Total quarts drank = 6 + 32 = 38 
So, there were 10 + 38 = 48 quarts in total at the beginning of the party.  
There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so the total is in gallons is 48 / 4 = 12.  
The answer is 12.

 Dale originally had 100 candies to sell.  He sold 150 candies.  That means he has 150 - 100 = 50 candies left to sell.  But then he ordered 100 more, which means he now has 50 + 100 = 150 candies.  Since he originally had 200 candies (100 + 100), he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 candies.  The answer is 50. 
 Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies.  After selling 150, he has 100 - 150 = -50.  But since he can't sell a negative number of candies, that means he still has -50 candies left to sell.  

But since he then ordered 100 more candies, he now has -50 + 100 = 50 more candies to sell.  So the answer is 50. 
 Dale started with 100 butterscotch candies, then he sold 150, so he had 100 - 150 = -50, but since you can't have a negative number of candies, it means he actually sold more candies than he had, so that doesn't matter.  Then he ordered 100 more candies, so now he has 100 + 100 = 200 candies.  To sell all his candies, he needs to sell 200 candies.  Since he already sold 150, he still needs to sell 200 - 150 = 50 more.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 411: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 310, [output]: 10 students were already on campus at the beginning of the year.  

At the end of January, there would be 2 x 10 = 20 students on campus. 

At the end of February, there would be 2 x 20 = 40 students on campus. 

At the end of March, there would be 2 x 40 = 80 students on campus. 

At the end of April, there would be 2 x 80 = 160 students on campus. 

At the end of May, there would be 2 x 160 = 320 students on campus. 

The number of additional students who joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is the difference between 320 and 10.  320 - 10 is 310.  The answer is 310. 
10 students were on campus to begin with.  January doubles the number, so 10 x 2 = 20.  February doubles the number, so 20 x 2 = 40.  March doubles the number, so 40 x 2 = 80.  April doubles the number, so 80 x 2 = 160.  May doubles the number, so 160 x 2 = 320.  So at the end of May, there would be 320 students.  But we want to know how many above the initial number, so we need to subtract: 320 - 10 = 310.  The answer is 310. 
10 students were there at the beginning.  The number doubled every month.  Doubling from 10 would be 20 students at the end of the first month, 40 students at the end of the second month, 80 students at the end of the third month, and 160 students at the end of the fourth month (April).  By the end of May, the total number of students would be 160 * 2 = 320.  At the end of May, the number of additional students would be 320 - 10 = 310.  The answer is 310. 
10 x 2 = 20, there are 10 students at the beginning of the year.  The number of students doubles every month, so at the end of the first month, there are 20 students.  20 x 2 = 40, at the end of the second month, there are 40 students.  40 x 2 = 80, at the end of the third month, there are 80 students.  80 x 2 = 160, at the end of the fourth month, there are 160 students.  160 x 2 = 320, at the end of the fifth month, there are 320 students.  

So, by the end of May, there would be 320 students.  Initially, there were 10 students, so that means that 320 - 10 = 310 additional students would have joined.  The answer is 310. 
10 students were at the beginning of the year.  By the end of the month, the number doubles.  So now there are 10 x 2 = 20 students.  

By the end of the second month (February), the number doubles again.  So there are now 20 x 2 = 40 students.  

By the end of the third month (March), the number doubles again.  So there are now 40 x 2 = 80 students.  

By the end of the fourth month (April), the number doubles again.  So there are now 80 x 2 = 160 students.  

By the end of the fifth month (May), the number doubles again.  So there are now 160 x 2 = 320 students.  

At the beginning of the year there were 10 students.  So by the time we get to the end of May, there would be 320 - 10 = 310 more students above the original number of students.  The answer is 310.

[EXP] 412: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 105 is the money Felix made.  He charges $. 25 per branch.  So to find the number of branches he climbed, we divide the money he made by the cost per branch: 105 / 0. 25 = 420.  Since Felix made money for 7 days, we divide the number of branches by 7: 420 / 7 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
105 dollars is the total money Felix made.  He charges 25 cents or 0. 25 dollars per branch.  We can find the number of branches he climbed by dividing 105 by 0. 25. 

105 / 0. 25 = 420

Since there are 7 days in a week, he climbed 420 / 7 = 60 branches per day on average. 

The answer is 60. 
 Felix made 105 dollars during the week.  He charges 0. 25 dollars for each branch.  So the total number of branches is 105 / 0. 25.  105 / 0. 25 = 420.  Since this is for the whole week, we need to average it.  420 branches in 7 days is 420 / 7 = 60 branches per day.  The answer is 60. 
105 dollars Felix made in total. 

Since he charges $0. 25 for every branch he climbs, we divide 105 by 0. 25 to get the total number of branches Felix climbed:

105 ÷ 0. 25 = 420 branches

Since Felix worked for 7 days, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to find the average number of branches he climbed per day:

420 ÷ 7 = 60 branches per day

The answer is 60. 
105 dollars made during the week.  To find the number of branches per day, we need to first find the number of branches Felix climbed in total.  It's 105 / . 25 = 420.  420 / 7 days in a week is 60.  The answer is 60. 
105 dollars were made.  He charges . 25 for every branch he climbs.  So we need to find how many branches he climbed in total.  105 / . 25 = 420.  Then we need to find out how many branches per day on average.  420 total branches / 7 days of work = 60 branches per day.  The answer is 60. 
105 dollars is the total amount Felix made.  We want to know how many branches he climbed on average per day.  So first, we divide 105 by 7 (since it's one week):

105 ÷ 7 = 15 dollars per day

Now, we know that Felix charges $. 25 per branch.  So to find the number of branches he climbed per day, we can divide the daily amount by $. 25:

15 ÷ 0. 25 = 60

So Felix climbed 60 branches per day.  The answer is 60. 
105 divided by the number of days (7) will give us his average earnings per day.  So 105 / 7 = 15.  Now this is his total earnings per day.  This total is made up of the cost of climbing branches.  Every branch costs 0. 25 dollars.  To find the number of branches he climbed each day, we divide his daily earnings by the cost of a branch.  15 / 0. 25 = 60.  The answer is 60 branches.

 Rose starts with 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  3 x 5 is 15.  She has 15 petals. 

Then, Rose picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  4 x 6 is 24.  So she has 15 + 24 = 39 petals.

After dropping 3 marshmallows, there are 17 - 3 = 14 marshmallows left.  If 14 marshmallows are left, then each person can make 14/2 = 7 S'mores.  The answer is 7. 
35 marshmallows are in the bag originally.  After making 9 S'mores each, that's 18 marshmallows used.  Dropping 3 on the ground means 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows are used.  So there are 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left. 

Since there are 14 marshmallows left, they can make 14 S'mores together, sharing them equally between John and DeSean.  So each can have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.  The answer is 7. 
35 marshmallows were in the bag.  9 S'mores were made by John, and 9 S'mores were made by DeSean.  That is 9 + 9 = 18 S'mores total.  Each S'more uses 1 marshmallow, so 18 marshmallows were used.  Then 3 marshmallows were dropped on the ground, so 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows were used in total.  35 marshmallows - 21 marshmallows = 14 marshmallows left.  Each S'more uses 1 marshmallow, so they have 14 marshmallows left.  14 marshmallows / 2 = 7 S'mores each.  The answer is 7.

He will play for 20 minutes.  1 hour is 60 minutes, so 4 hours will be 4 x 60 minutes = 240 minutes.  240 divided by 20 minutes per game is 240/20 = 12.  Jack will play 12 games, so he'll spend 12 x 1 = 12 quarters.  Then, 2 of his friends will play.  They will play for half the time of Jack.  So they will play for 20 minutes / 2 = 10 minutes.  240 minutes divided by 10 minutes is 240/10 = 24 games.  2 friends x 24 games = 48 games.  So their quarters will add up to 48 games x 1 quarter per game = 48 quarters.  Then, one friend will play more games than Jack.  He will play for 1. 5 times Jack's time.  So he will play for 20 minutes x 1. 5 = 30 minutes.  240 minutes divided by 30 minutes is 240/30 = 8 games.  He will play 8 games.  8 games x 1 quarter per game is 8 quarters.  Now we add all their quarters together: Jack's 12 quarters, 2 friends' 48 quarters, and significant friend's 8 quarters.  12 + 48 + 8 = 68.  The answer is 68.

[EXP] 416: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt.  Since she uses the same amount of salt as sugar, we know that the amount of oil she uses is also the amount of sugar multiplied by 2. 

Let's call the amount of salt (and sugar) x.  Then the amount of oil is 2x. 

Next, we know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so the amount of citrus zest is also x. 

Finally, we know that Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest, so the amount of salt is 2x. 

The total amount of mixture is 10 ounces, and it's a combination of salt, oil, sugar, citrus zest, and fragrance.  Since Tanya uses the same amount of salt and sugar, we can simplify the mixture to have only 3 components: oil, zest, and fragrance. 

The total amount of mixture is 10 ounces, so the total amount of oil plus zest plus fragrance must be 10 ounces.  We can write an equation:

2x + x + x = 10

Combine like terms:

4x = 10

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 2. 5

So the amount of salt (and sugar) is 2. 5 ounces.  Since the oil is twice as much as the salt, the amount of oil is:

2x = 2(2. 5) = 5 ounces

[EXP] 419: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's first find out how many cars Joe has.  Since he has twice as many cars as Robert, and Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars. 

Then, Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 20% of 40 = 0. 20 x 40 = 8 cars. 

So, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left after selling. 

Next, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother, which is 2 x 8 = 16 cars. 

After giving away 16 cars, Joe is left with 32 - 16 = 16 cars. 

The answer is 16. 
 Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has twice as many, which is 2 x 20 = 40.  Joe sells 20% of them, which is 0. 2 x 40 = 8 cars.  He gives away twice the number he sold, which is 2 x 8 = 16 cars.  So, Joe sold or gave away 8 + 16 = 24 cars in total.  He had 40 cars initially, so he has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.  The answer is 16. 
 Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.  Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.  Joe sells 20% of his cars.  20% of 40 is 8, so he sells 8 cars.  After that, he gives away 2 times the number of cars he sold, which is 8 * 2 = 16 cars.  So he gave away 16 cars.  After selling and giving away cars, Joe has 40 - 8 - 16 = 16 cars left.  The answer is 16. 
 Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has 20 * 2 = 40 cars.  Then Joe sells 20% of his cars.  20% of 40 is 40 * 0. 2 = 8.  So Joe sold 8 cars.  He gives away twice as many as he sold to his mother, so he gave away 8 * 2 = 16.  Before selling and giving away cars, Joe had 40 cars.  After selling 8, he had 40 - 8 = 32.  Then after giving away 16, he had 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.  The answer is 16. 
 First, find out how many cars Joe has.  Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, who has 20 cars.  So Joe has 2 x 20 = 40 cars.  Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 20% of 40 = 8 cars.  So he has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left.  Joe gave away twice as many cars as the number he sold, which is 2 x 8 = 16 cars.  So he gave his mother 16 cars.  Joe now has 32 - 16 = 16 cars remaining.  The answer is 16. 
 Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has twice as many, which is 20 x 2 = 40 cars. 

Joe sells 20% of his cars.  20% of 40 is 40 * 0. 2 = 8.  So he sells 8 cars. 

After selling 8 cars, Joe has 40 - 8 = 32 cars left. 

He gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother.  He gave away 8 cars to Robert, 16 cars in total (8 * 2). 

After giving away 16 cars to his mother, Joe has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left. 

The answer is 16. 
 Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has twice as many cars, which is 20 * 2 = 40.  He sells 20% of them.  20% of 40 is 20/100 * 40 = 8.  So after selling 20% of his cars, Joe is left with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.  Then, Joe gives away twice as many as the number he sold to his mother.  Since he sold 8, he gives away 2 * 8 = 16.  So Joe now has 32 - 16 = 16 cars left.  The answer is 16. 
 Since Robert has 20 cars, Joe has twice as many, which is 20 * 2 = 40 cars.  Joe sells 20% of his cars.  To find 20% of 40, convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, so 20/100 = 0. 2.  Multiply this by the number of cars, 40 * 0. 2 = 8.  So Joe sells 8 cars.  He then gives away twice as many cars as he sold, which is 8 x 2 = 16.  He sold 8 cars and gave away 16, for a total of 24 cars.  If Joe had 40 cars, and he gave away 24, he will have 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.  The answer is 16.

[EXP] 420: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6,250, [output]: 20 students were working together.  They raised a total of $175,000.  $50,000 comes from organizations, so the students raised the remaining amount, which is $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000.  Since there are 20 students, each student must have raised 125,000 / 20 = 6,250.  The answer is 6,250. 
20 students are working together to raise money, and they raised a total of $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000 from the students.  Since they all earn the same amount, we divide the total amount by 20 to find out how much each student raised.  125,000 / 20 = 6,250.  The answer is 6,250. 
175,000 dollars was the total money raised.  50,000 came from organizations.  So 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 dollars came from the students.  If 20 students raised the same amount of money, then the amount each student raised is 125,000 / 20.  125,000 / 20 is 6,250.  The answer is 6,250. 
20 students raised some unknown amount of money.  In total, 175,000 dollars were raised.  50,000 dollars came from organizations.  So, the students raised 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 dollars. 

Then, to find out how much each student raised, you can do 125,000 / 20 = 6,250.

[EXP] 421: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 720, [output]: 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes on the first day.  She walked half as much on the second day.  Half of 480 is 240.  480 + 240 is 720.  The answer is 720. 
1 hour = 60 minutes.  Sandy walked for 8 hours, so she walked for 8 * 60 = 480 minutes on the first day.  On the second day, she walked half as many hours, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours.  4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes.  The total time is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.  The answer is 720. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

On the first day, Sandy walked for 8 hours.  We need to convert this to minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

8 hours = 8 x 60 = 480 minutes

On the second day, Sandy walked for half as many hours as she walked on the first day.  So she walked for:

8 hours / 2 = 4 hours

And convert this to minutes:

4 hours = 4 x 60 = 240 minutes

Now, we need to add the total time Sandy took to walk in the two days:

480 minutes (first day) + 240 minutes (second day) = 720 minutes

The answer is 720 minutes. 
 Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.  She walked half as many hours on the second day.  Half of 8 hours is 8/2 = 4 hours.  So on the second day, she walked for 4 hours.  We need to convert the hours to minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 8 hours is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes and 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.  The total minutes Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720.  The answer is 720. 
8 hours Sandy walked on the first day.  She walked half that number on the second day.  8 / 2 = 4.  So she walked 4 hours on the second day. 

Let's convert the hours to minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour.  So 8 hours on the first day will be 8 * 60 = 480 minutes.  And 4 hours on the second day will be 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. 

The total time Sandy took to walk in the two days is 480 + 240 = 720 minutes.  The answer is 720. 
1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.  

Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.  8 hours x 60 minutes = 480 minutes. 

On the second day, she walked for half the time of the first day.  8 hours / 2 = 4 hours.  4 hours x 60 minutes = 240 minutes. 

To find the total number of minutes Sandy walked on both days, add up 480 minutes and 240 minutes.  480 + 240 = 720.  The answer is 720 minutes.

[EXP] 422: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]: 50 cars were originally in the parking lot.  After 20 more cars arrived, there were 50 + 20 = 70 cars in the parking lot.  When half of them left, the number of cars left is 70/2 = 35.  The answer is 35. 
 Hunter started by counting 50 cars.  During the break, 20 more cars showed up.  So in total, he saw 50 + 20 = 70 cars.  When he got out for lunch, half of the cars had left.  Half of 70 is 35.  So 70 - 35 is 35.  During the lunch break, he saw 35 cars.  The answer is 35. 
 First, there were 50 cars.  Then, 20 more cars arrived.  So, 50 + 20 = 70.  1/2 of 70 is 35.  So, 35 cars left the parking lot.  To find the total cars Hunter counted during lunch break, we need to subtract the cars that left from the total number of cars, so 70 - 35 = 35.  The answer is 35. 
50 cars were initially counted.  20 more cars arrived, so the total number of cars is 50 + 20 = 70.  1/2 of these cars left, so 1/2 * 70 = 35 cars left.  The question is asking for the cars he counted during lunch break, not the number that left.  Since Hunter is counting the cars again, he counts all the remaining 35 cars.  The answer is 35. 
1/2 the number of cars in the parking lot means half the number of cars that were there.  So, half of 70 is 35.  We need to find the difference in the number of cars initially counted and the number of cars counted after half reduced.  So, we subtract 35 from 70 and get 70 - 35 = 35.  The answer is 35. 
 Originally, there were 50 cars in the parking lot.  During the first break, 20 more cars arrived.  So there were 50 + 20 = 70 cars.  At this point, half of the cars left, which is 70/2 = 35.  Hunter counted the cars during the lunch break.  He counted the cars that left the parking lot, which is the same as the cars that were there originally and left.  Since he counted the original total at the start of the day, he counted 35 cars during lunch break.  The answer is 35.

 John does 30 cycles of work a day.  Each cycle has 5 tasks and each task pays 1. 20 dollars.  1. 20 * 5 = 6 dollars per cycle.  In total, he makes 6 * 30 = 180 dollars a day.  For a full week, he would make 180 * 7 = 1260 dollars.  The answer is 1260. 
30 cycles a day means John does 30 * 5 tasks a day, since each cycle has 5 tasks.  So, 30 * 5 = 150 tasks a day.  Each task pays 1. 20 dollars, so he makes 150 * 1. 20 = 180 dollars a day.  For a whole week of 7 days, he makes 180 * 7 = 1260 dollars.  The answer is 1260.

14 points in the first game, and 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. 
Let's break it down step by step:

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points.  Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, which means Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game, which is 10.  So, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game. 

To find the total points Sasha scored, we add the points she scored in both games: 14 + 4 = 18. 

The answer is 18. 
 From the text, we have the following information:

In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
In the first game, Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so she scored 14 - 4 = 10 points.

[EXP] 426: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 153, [output]:  Let's say PJ has x cards.  Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards as PJ, Smendrick has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards. 

The total number of cards is 341.  So we can set up the equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7: x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards.  Smendrick has 3 times that, or 3 x 47 = 141 cards.  Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards. 

The answer is 153. 
341 is the total number of cards.  Let's focus on PJ's cards first.  Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, say PJ has x cards.  Smendrick has 3x cards.  Becca has 12 more than Smendrick.  So Becca has 3x + 12 cards. 

The total number of cards is the sum of the number of cards each person has: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341. 
Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341. 
Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329. 
Divide both sides by 7: x = 47. 
So PJ has 47 cards.  Smendrick has 3 times as many, so Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards.  And Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, so Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

In total, she has 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.  The answer is 27. 
 Cindy has 5 green eggs.  Twice as many blue eggs means she has 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs.  One fewer pink egg than blue eggs means she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Finally, one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs means she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  Now that we have the number of each kind of egg, we can find the total number of eggs.  5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 We can start by recognizing the number of blue eggs.  Since Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she has 5 green eggs, the number of blue eggs is 2 x 5 = 10.  Then, since she has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Finally, since she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, she has 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  In total, Cindy has 5 green eggs, 10 blue eggs, 9 pink eggs, and 3 yellow eggs.  The sum of all these is 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
 We have to figure out how many eggs of each color Cindy had.  We start by finding out how many blue eggs she had.  She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so if she had 5 green eggs, she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 

Next, she had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs.  So if she had 10 blue eggs, she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 

Finally, Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs.  So if she had 9 pink eggs, she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

In total, Cindy had 5 green eggs, 10 blue eggs, 9 pink eggs, and 3 yellow eggs.  5 + 10 + 9 + 3 is 27.  The answer is 27.

[EXP] 428: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]:  First, calculate the shipping cost:

Shipping cost = weight * cost per pound + distance * cost per mile
= 4 pounds * $0. 35/pound + 20 miles * $0. 08/mile
= $1. 40 + $1. 60
= $2. 00

Next, calculate the refund Milly will get:

Refund = 75% of $32
= 0. 75 * $32
= $24

Now, calculate the total amount Milly will lose:

Total loss = Purchase price - Refund - Shipping cost
= $32 - $24 - $2. 00
= $6. 00

The answer is 6. 
1st step: Calculate the shipping cost: 
 - The book weights 4 pounds, so the weight cost is 4 x 0. 35 = 1. 4. 
 - To get to the distribution center, 20 miles are traveled, so the mileage cost is 20 x 0. 08 = 1. 6. 
 - The total shipping cost is 1. 4 + 1. 6 = 2.  

2nd step: Calculate the refund: 
 - The book cost $32, and Milly will get 75% back, so the refund is 0. 75 x 32 = 24. 

3rd step: Find the loss in total:
 - The total shipping cost is 2, and the refund is 24. 
 - 2 + 24 is 26.  But Milly has to give 32 dollars to the shipping company.  
 - So, the loss is 32 - 26 = 6.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 430: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14,000, [output]:  Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.  The first week, he produces 8,000 bars.  The second week, he produces half as much, which is 4,000.  The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, which is 8,000 * 3 = 24,000.  So far, Boris has produced 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.  He still needs to produce 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.  The answer is 14,000. 
 Boris started by producing 8,000 bars the first week.  The second week, he produced half as much, which is 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.  The third week, he produced three times as much, which is 8,000 x 3 = 24,000.  

So, in total, Boris produced 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars in the first three weeks.  This leaves 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars for the fourth week. 

The answer is 14,000. 
50,000 bars of chocolate are produced each month.  The first week, Boris produces 8,000 bars.  The second week, he produces half as much, so 4,000 bars.  The third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so 3 x 8,000 = 24,000 bars. 

So far, Boris produced 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.  To find out how much he has left, we subtract 36,000 from 50,000.  50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000. 

The answer is 14,000. 
 Boris started by producing 50,000 bars of chocolate.  He produced 8,000 bars in the first week.  The second week, he produced half of that, which is 4000 bars.  The third week, he produced 3 times as much as the first week, which is 24,000 bars.  The total number of bars produced so far is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars.  The answer is 14,000 bars.

[EXP] 432: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 324, [output]:  We need to figure out how many additional items Angela needs to install.  Angela has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures total.  Compared to the original installation, she has 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors, 2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier, and 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures.  So, Angela will need 2 + 1 + 10 = 13 additional items installed.  Each additional item costs 15 dollars, so that is 13 x 15 = 195 dollars.  Adding this to the original cost of 129 dollars, the total cost is 129 + 195 = 324.  The answer is 324. 
 The interior design firm has a standard installation cost of $129. 00.   The standard installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.   The standard installation costs include hanging all these items, so those are extra.   The cost of extra items is $15. 00 per item.   Angela needs 6 mirrors, which are 6 - 4 = 2 extra.   These will cost 2 x 15 = 30.   She needs 2 chandeliers, which are 2 - 1 = 1 extra.   These will cost 1 x 15 = 15.   She needs 20 pictures, which is 20 - 10 = 10 extra.   These will cost 10 x 15 = 150.   The total cost for extra items will be 30 + 15 + 150 = 195.   The total cost will be the standard installation + the cost of extra items, which is 129 + 195 = 324.

[EXP] 434: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 x 12 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 48 = 480 inches. 

There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so Naruto can lift a mountain 480 / 12 = 40 feet.  The answer is 40 feet. 
 Let's break it down step by step:

1.  Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 x 1 = 12 inches. 
2.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 x 4 = 48 inches. 
3.  Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 x 10 = 480 inches. 
4.  Finally, we need to convert inches to feet: 1 foot = 12 inches, so 480 inches = 480 / 12 = 40 feet. 

The answer is 40 feet. 
 Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, and Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.  Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.  So Naruto can lift a mountain 10 x 4 x 12 = 480 times higher than Pompei.  If Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Naruto can lift a mountain 480 x 1 = 480 inches.  That is 480 / 12 = 40 feet.  The answer is 40. 
 Since Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch, then Saskay can lift it 12 times higher, so 1 inch * 12 = 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift it 4 times higher than Saskay, so 12 inches * 4 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift it 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so 48 inches * 10 = 480 inches.  There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so 480 inches is equal to 480 / 12 = 40 feet.  The answer is 40. 
 Let's start with the last statement: Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can, and Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.  So Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches. 

Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 x 4 = 48 inches. 

Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 x 10 = 480 inches. 

To convert 480 inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot): 480 ÷ 12 = 40 feet. 

The answer is 40 feet. 
1 inch = a small unit.  Saskay can lift 12 times that, which is 12 inches = 1 foot.  So Kagiyami can lift 1 foot * 4 = 4 feet.  Naruto can lift 10 times what Kagiyami can.  So Naruto can lift 10 * 4 feet = 40 feet.  The answer is 40 feet.

[EXP] 436: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Since 3 kangaroos took 18 hours, 1 kangaroo would take 18 ÷ 3 = 6 hours. 
Since the turtles are traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, they travel at half the rate.  So they will take 6 x 2 = 12 hours. 

The answer is 12. 
18 hours are needed for 3 kangaroos to travel across the highway.  The distance they travel is unknown, but we can find the rate at which they travel.  To do so, we can divide the distance by the rate. 

3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take 18 hours to travel a certain distance.  So the rate of the kangaroos is 18 hours ÷ 3 kangaroos = 6 hours per kangaroo. 

The turtles travel at half the speed of the kangaroos.  A kangaroo travels 6 hours, so each turtle travels 3 hours.  4 turtles take 4 * 3 hours to travel the same distance: 12 hours. 

The answer is 12. 
3 kangaroos traveling for 18 hours is a total amount of distance traveled.  Since each kangaroo's speed is the same, each kangaroo must travel the same distance.  That distance is 18 / 3 = 6 hours.  Then, we have to figure out how long it takes for one kangaroo to travel that distance.  That is 6 hours. 

Now, four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, means each turtle is traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo.  So, each turtle travels 1 / 2 of the speed of a kangaroo.  So, to travel the same distance (6 hours) at this speed, the turtle will take 6 * 2 = 12 hours. 

The answer is 12.

3 large apples will generate 3 x 5 = 15 slices and 5 small apples will generate 5 x 3 = 15 slices.  So in total there are 15 + 15 = 30 slices.  Since Adam ate 15 slices, he has 30 - 15 = 15 slices left.  The answer is 15. 
 Adam decides to slice 3 large apples and 5 small apples.  Each large apple can be sliced into 5 pieces, so 3 large apples will yield 3 x 5 = 15 large apple pieces.  Each small apple can be sliced into 3 pieces, so 5 small apples will yield 5 x 3 = 15 small apple pieces.  In total, Adam will get 15 + 15 = 30 apple pieces.  Adam eats 15 slices, so he has 30 - 15 = 15 apple slices left.  The answer is 15. 
3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 pieces.  5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 pieces.  So altogether, Adam sliced 15 + 15 = 30 apple slices.  Since Adam ate 15 slices, he has 30 - 15 = 15 pieces of apple left.  The answer is 15. 
 First, we need to find out how many slices Adam can get from 3 large and 5 small apples.  3 large apples can be sliced into 3 x 5 = 15 pieces.  5 small apples can be sliced into 5 x 3 = 15 pieces.  Total pieces are 15 + 15 = 30.  Then Adam eats 15 slices.  30 - 15 = 15.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 440: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 25 liters of milk per day.  The farmer currently gets 5 liters a day from each cow.  So from 3 cows, they get 5 x 3 = 15 liters a day.  They need 25 - 15 = 10 liters more per day.  Since they get 5 liters a day per cow, they need 10 / 5 = 2 more cows.  The answer is 2. 
5 liters per cow is 5 x 3 = 15 liters per day.  This is short of 25 liters by 25 - 15 = 10 liters.  So, the farmer needs to get 10 more liters per day.  To get 10 more liters, the farmer needs to get 10 / 5 = 2 more cows since each cow produces 5 liters.  The answer is 2. 
5 liters of milk per day per cow.  He has 3 cows.  So he is currently producing 5 * 3 = 15 liters per day.  To produce 25 liters per day, he is missing 25 - 15 = 10 liters.  Each cow provides 5 liters per day.  To find out how many cows he needs, we divide the amount he needs by the amount each cow can produce.  10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 more cows.  The answer is 2. 
5 liters of milk a day from 3 cows.  So 5 * 3 = 15 liters of milk.  We want 25 liters of milk a day.  We have 15 and need 25.  So we need 25 - 15 = 10 more liters of milk.  1 cow can produce 5 liters of milk per day.  To make more milk, we need more cows.  10 liters of milk/ 5 liters per cow = 2 more cows.  The answer is 2. 
 The farmer already produces 5 liters per day having 3 cows.  5 * 3 = 15 liters.  15 liters are produced already.  He needs 25 liters per day.  So, how much more does he need to produce? 25 - 15 = 10 liters.  Since he needs to produce 10 liters more, he needs 10/5 = 2 more cows.  The answer is 2.

[EXP] 441: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's calculate the used length of each glue stick and then subtract the used length from the original length to find the remaining length. 

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, so it's used 1 - (1/6) = 5/6, which means 5/6 * 12 = 10 millimeters are used.  The remaining length is 12 - 10 = 2 millimeters. 

The second glue stick has 2/3 left, so it's used 1 - (2/3) = 1/3, which means 1/3 * 12 = 4 millimeters are used.  The remaining length is 12 - 4 = 8 millimeters. 

The third glue stick has 1/2 left, so it's used 1 - (1/2) = 1/2, which means 1/2 * 12 = 6 millimeters are used.  The remaining length is 12 - 6 = 6 millimeters. 

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the sum of the remaining lengths: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 millimeters. 

The answer is 16. 
 Let's first find how much length of each glue stick is not used:

1.  There is 1/6 left, so 5/6 is used.  Since the glue stick is 12 mm long, 5/6 of 12 mm is used.  So, 5/6 * 12 = 10 mm is used and 12 - 10 = 2 mm is left. 

2.  There is 2/3 left, so 1/3 is used.  1/3 * 12 = 4 mm is used and 12 - 4 = 8 mm is left. 

3.  There is 1/2 left, so 1/2 is used.  1/2 * 12 = 6 mm is used and 12 - 6 = 6 mm is left. 

Now, let's find the total length of the glue sticks that are not used:

2 mm + 8 mm + 6 mm = 16 mm

The answer is 16 mm. 
 Let's find the total amount of glue not used from each glue stick and then add them together.  

The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 1/6 of the original length, which is 1/6 x 12 = 2 mm.  Left.  
The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 2/3 of the original length, which is 2/3 x 12 = 8 mm left. 
The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 of the original length, which is 1/2 x 12 = 6 mm left. 

The glue sticks have a total of 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm of not used glue.  The answer is 16.

[EXP] 445: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Let's start by figuring out how many socks and dishes Jack has.  Jack has 60 dishes.  Since he collected twice as many dishes as socks, he has 60 / 2 = 30 socks.  Since Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, he has 60 / 2 = 30 dishes.  And since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, he has 30 x 2 = 60 socks.  Together, they have 30 socks + 30 socks + 30 dishes + 60 dishes = 30 + 30 + 30 + 60 = 150.  The answer is 150. 
 Let's start by using the information that Jack has 60 dishes.  Since Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack, Peter has 60/2 = 30 dishes. 

Now, let's use the information that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.  Since Jack has an unknown number of socks, let's call it x.  Then, Peter has 2x socks. 

We can set up an equation based on the information that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks: 60 = 2x. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2: x = 30. 

So, Jack has 30 socks. 

Now that we know how many socks Jack has, we can find how many socks Peter has: 2x = 2(30) = 60. 

In total, Peter and Jack have 60 socks.  Adding this to the 30 + 60 = 90 dishes, they have a total of 90 + 60 = 150. 

The answer is 150.

[EXP] 446: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 20 students in total, 5 good at math only, and 20 - (5 + 8) = 7 students left who are good at both.  Since the total number who are good at math is the sum of the ones who are good at math only and the ones who are good at both, the number who are good at math is 5 + 7 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
20 students are in Miss Susan's class.  5 are good at math only, and 8 are good at English only.  The rest are good at both.  In total, 5 + 8 = 13 are good at either math or English only.  Since there are 20 students overall, the rest must be 20 - 13 = 7 who are good at both.  So the total number of students who are good at math is 5 (who are good at math only) + 7 (who are good at both) = 12.  The answer is 12. 
20 students are in total.  5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only.  That means the rest are good at both.  So, there are 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7 students who are good at both math and English.  Then, the total number of students good at math is 5 students who are good at math only and 7 who are good at both math and English.  5 + 7 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
20 students are in Miss Susan's class.  5 students are good at math only.  8 students are good at English only.  Since 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only, these 13 students must be good at either math, English, or both.  So, the number of students who are good at both math and English is 20 - 13 = 7. 

Now, we know that 5 students are good at math only.  Since there are 7 students good at both math and English, the total number of students good at math is 5 + 7 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
20 students are in the class.  There are 5 students good at math only.  There are 8 students good at English only.  So the 5 students good at math only and the 8 students good at English only must be 5 + 8 = 13 students.  Then the only remaining students are the 20 - 13 = 7 students who are good at both math and English.  Finally, the total number of students good at math is 5 who are good at math only + 7 who are good at both math and English = 5 + 7 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
20 students originally are in Miss Susan's class.  5 only are good at math.  So we are looking for the rest of the students who are good at both math and English.  Let's find the total number of students who are good at either math or English (or both).  5 are good at math and 8 are good at English, but there are some students who are good at both, so we have to subtract those students from 5 and 8 to avoid double counting.  The number of students who are good at both is not given in the problem, but we will come back to that.  5 who are good at math only and 8 who are good at English only make a total of 5 + 8 = 13 students who are good at either but not both math and English.  These 13 students, combined with 20 students in total, should give us the total number of students who are good at math and/or English, which is 20 + 13 = 33.  However, the number of students who are good at only math and only English is 13, but we want to know the number of students who are only good at math, which is the number of students good at math and English minus the number good at only English.  We can find the number of students good at both math and English by subtracting the 13 from the 20, so 20 - 13 = 7.  These 7 students are good at both math and English.  Then, we already know that 5 are good at math but not English, so in total, 7 + 5 = 12 students are good at math.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 447: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]: 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.  2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage is 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.  A 10-minute intermission is added.  So the duration for one group is 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.  The total time for the concert is 120 minutes.  120 / 20 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
2 hours = 2 x 60 = 120 minutes

For each group, there is a 2-minute setup, a 6-minute performance, and a 2-minute exit, for a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes

Adding an 10-minute intermission, each group occupies 10 + 10 = 20 minutes

Since the concert has a total of 120 minutes, the number of groups that can perform is:

120 / 20 = 6 groups

The answer is 6. 
120 minutes is the total time for the concert (2 hours).  There are 3 parts to each group's performance: getting on stage (2 minutes), performing (6 minutes), and exiting stage (2 minutes).  This adds up to a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes per group.  Then, there's a 10-minute intermission in between each group.  So, total time per group is 10 + 10 = 20 minutes.  To find out how many groups can fit in 2 hours, divide the total minutes (120) by the minutes per group (20).  120 / 20 = 6.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 449: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many white shirts have collars.  If half of the white shirts have collars, then the number of white shirts with collars is half of 40, which is 20.  That means 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts do not have collars. 

Let's do the same with the floral shirts.  20 floral shirts have buttons, so 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts do not have buttons. 

To find the difference between the number of floral shirts with no buttons and the number of white shirts with no collars, subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons.  30 - 20 = 10. 

The answer is 10. 
 First, let's find the total number of shirts with or without features.  Half of the white shirts (40) have collars, so the other half (40 / 2 = 20) do not have collars.  For the floral shirts, we know 20 have buttons, so 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts do not have buttons. 

Now we can compare the numbers.  There are 30 floral shirts with no buttons, and 20 white shirts with no collars.  To find out how many more floral shirts with no buttons there are, we subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10. 

The answer is 10. 
 There originally were 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half of the white shirts have collars, so that means 40/2 = 20 white shirts have collars.  So there are 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars. 
For floral shirts, 20 have buttons, so 50 - 20 = 30 have no buttons. 
Since 30 floral shirts have no buttons and 20 white shirts have no collars, we subtract 20 from 30 to find the difference, which is 30 - 20 = 10. 

The answer is 10. 
 First, find out how many white shirts have collars.   Half of 40 shirts is 20 shirts.   The rest of the white shirts have no collars, which is 40 - 20 = 20.   Then, find out how many floral shirts have buttons.  There are 20 floral shirts that have buttons.  Now, find the number of floral shirts with no buttons.  This will be the total number of floral shirts minus the number of floral shirts with buttons, which is 50 - 20 = 30.   Finally, compare the number of floral shirts with no buttons to the number of white shirts with no collars.   There are 30 - 20 = 10 more floral shirts with no buttons than white shirts with no collars.  The answer is 10. 
ographically there are 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half of the 40 white shirts have collars, which is 20.  The number of white shirts with no collars is 40 - 20 = 20.  So, the number of white shirts with no collars is 20. 

 Now we calculate the number of floral shirts have no buttons.  There are 50 floral shirts in total.  20 of them have buttons.  Therefore, 50 - 20 = 30.  The number of floral shirts with no buttons is 30. 

 The number of floral shirts with no buttons - the number of white shirts with no collars: 30 - 20 = 10.  The answer is 10.

[EXP] 450: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 900 eggs are originally.  A tray holds 30 eggs.  To find how many trays the farmer has, we divide 900 eggs by 30 eggs per tray.  900 ÷ 30 = 30 trays.  Each tray is worth 2. 5 dollars.  So he will earn 2. 5 * 30 = 75 dollars.  The answer is 75. 
 Let's break it down step by step.  The farmer has 900 eggs and he places them on a tray that holds 30 eggs each.  This means he has 900 / 30 = 30 trays.  The farmer sells each tray for $2. 5, so he earns 30 x 2. 5 = 75 dollars.  The answer is 75. 
 The farmer has 900 eggs.  To find out how many trays he has, we divide the number of eggs by the capacity of each tray: 900 / 30 = 30 trays.  So the farmer has 30 trays. 

If the farmer sells each tray for $2. 5, then the total amount he will earn is: 30 x 2. 5 = 75

The answer is 75. 
900 eggs.  Eggs on a tray hold 30 eggs.  So the number of trays he can fill with eggs is 900 / 30 = 30.  Each tray sells for $2. 5.  Total earnings is 30 x 2. 5 = 75.  The answer is 75. 
900 eggs come in trays that hold 30 eggs.  So we can put the eggs into trays like this: 900 ÷ 30 = 30 trays.  The farmer will have 30 trays of eggs to sell.  Each tray earns $2. 5, so in total the farmer will earn 30 * 2. 5 = 75 dollars.  The answer is 75.

In total, he has 45 goats from Farm X and 25 goats from Farm Y.  45 + 25 = 70.  The answer is 70. 
 Mr.  Smith has 55 goats in Farm X.  From Farm X, he sold 10 goats, leaving him with 55 - 10 = 45 goats.  He has 45 goats in Farm Y.  He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y, so that's 2 x 10 = 20 goats.  After selling those, he has 45 - 20 = 25 goats in Farm Y.  In total, he has 45 + 25 = 70 goats.  The answer is 70. 
 Mr.  Smith started with 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.  In total, that is 55 + 45 = 100 goats.  From Farm X, he sold 10 goats.

 First, we need to know how many goats were sold.  He sold 10 goats from Farm X and 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm Y.  In total, 10 + 20 = 30 goats were sold.  We need to calculate the total number of goats before selling them. 
He has 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.  So, in total, he has 55 + 45 = 100 goats.

 James spends $2640 on shoes in a year.  Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, that means he buys 2 x 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.  To find out how much he spends on each pair, we divide the total amount he spends, $2640, by the number of pairs, 24.  2640 / 24 = 110.  The answer is 110. 
12 months in a year.  James buys 2 pairs of shoes per month.  So he buys 2 x 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year.  The total amount spent is $2640.  To find the average, we can divide the total amount by the number of pairs.  $2640 / 24 = $110.  The answer is 110. 
 James buys shoes a month.  Since there are 12 months, he buys 2 * 12 = 24 pairs of shoes in a year.  He spends $2640 on 24 pairs.  So he spends 2640 ÷ 24 dollars on each pair.  2640 ÷ 24 is 110.  The answer is 110.

3 baskets of red food will cost 3 x 18 = 54 dollars. 

With a 2-dollar discount for each basket of red food, the total cost is 54 - 2 x 3 = 54 - 6 = 48. 

So, the total cost is 75 + 48 = 123 dollars. 

The answer is 123. 
3 baskets of green food will cost 3 x $25 = $75.  A basket of red food is $18, but 2 dollars is taken off for each, so it costs $16.  3 baskets of red food will then cost 3 x $16 = $48.  The total cost is $75 + $48 = $123.  The answer is 123. 
 Let's start by calculating the total cost without the discount for the red food.  3 baskets of green food will cost 3 x 25 = 75 dollars.  Red food costs 18 dollars per basket, so 3 red food baskets will cost 3 x 18 = 54 dollars.  The total without the discount is 75 + 54 = 129 dollars.  Since there's a 2-dollar discount for each basket of red food and there are 3 baskets of red food, the total discount is 3 x 2 = 6 dollars.  So the total discount subtracted from the total without discount is 129 - 6 = 123.  The answer is 123. 
 We know that a basket of green food costs $25, and we need to buy 3 of them.  Therefore, the cost of 3 green baskets is 3 x 25 = 75. 

For the red basket, we get $2 off for each basket.  If we buy just 1 red basket, that would be 18 - 2 = 16.  For 3 red baskets, the cost would be 3 x (18 - 2) = 3 x 16 = 48. 

We now have to pay for both.  The total cost is 75 for the green food and 48 for the red food.  To find the total, we add 75 + 48.  This gives 123.  The answer is 123.

 There are 90 rooms originally.  One half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45.  It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.  So it takes 20 x 45 = 900 minutes to clean 45 rooms.  900 minutes is equal to 900 / 60 = 15 hours.  The answer is 15. 
90 rooms are at the motel.  90 / 2 is 45.  So housekeeping needs to clean 45 rooms.  It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.  20 * 45 = 900.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 900 / 60 is 15.  The answer is 15. 
90 is the total number of rooms, and we want to clean one-half of them.  One-half of 90 is 45.  To find the time to clean 45 rooms, we need to know how long it takes to clean one room.  It takes 20 minutes to clean one room.  So to clean 45 rooms, it would take 45 x 20 minutes = 900 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in one hour, so we can convert 900 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.  900 / 60 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
90 rooms at the motel, but we need to clean half of them, so we need to calculate half of 90.  Half of 90 is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.  It takes 20 minutes to clean one room, so it will take 20 minutes * 45 rooms = 900 minutes to clean 45 rooms.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we need to divide 900 minutes by 60 to get the total number of hours it will take.  900 / 60 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
90 rooms, and one-half of the rooms means half of 90, which is 45 rooms.  Each room takes 20 minutes, so cleaning 1 room will take 20 minutes.  To clean 45 rooms, it will take 45 * 20 minutes.  45 * 20 is 900.  Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 900 minutes is 900 / 60 = 15 hours.  The answer is 15. 
1/2 of the 90 rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms.  It takes 20 minutes to clean each room.  To find how many hours it will take, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 20 minutes to hours as 20/60 = 1/3 hour.  To find the time to clean 45 rooms, we multiply the time per room by the number of rooms: 45 * 1/3 = 15 hours.  The answer is 15 hours. 
1/2 of 90 rooms is 90/2 = 45 rooms.  To find the time to clean those rooms, first we need to find the time to clean one room.  It takes 20 minutes to clean one room.  So it will take 20 minutes to clean all the rooms.  To find the time to clean 45 rooms, we multiply 20 by 45.  20 * 45 = 900 minutes.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 900 by 60 to get hours.  900 / 60 = 15.  The answer is 15 hours.

The answer is 144. 
12 homes will be built in the first year.  In the next year, three times this many homes will be built, so it will be 12 * 3 = 36 homes.  In the third year, the homes built so far (12 + 36 = 48) will be doubled.  So, 48 * 2 = 96.  The town will have built 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes over the next three years.  The answer is 144. 
 The town builds 12 homes the first year.  The next year, they build 3 times this many, which is 12 * 3 = 36 homes.  The third year, they double the amount.  12 + 36 = 48 homes.  48 * 2 = 96 homes.  The town builds 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes over the next three years.  The answer is 144. 
 In the first year, they will build 12 homes.  Then, in the next year, they will build 3 x 12 = 36 homes.  So, in the first two years, they will have built 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  In the third year, they will double the amount they have built so far, so they will double 48 to get 96 homes.  48 + 96 is 144.  The answer is 144. 
 According to the question, in the first year, the town will build 12 homes.  In the next year, they will build 3 times this many homes, which is 12 * 3 = 36.  So in total in the first two years, the town will build 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  In the third year, they will double this amount.  The town will double 48, so 48 * 2 = 96.  So in the third year, they will build 96 homes.  In total over the three years, the town will build 12 + 36 + 96 = 144 homes.  The answer is 144.

[EXP] 456: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that I am 3 years younger than my brother.  Let's say my brother's age is x.  Then, my age is x - 3. 
Next, I know that I am 2 years older than my sister, so my sister's age is x - 5. 
My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so my mom's age is 3x - 1. 
Now, we know that when we add all our ages, we get 87.  So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 3) + (x - 5) + (3x - 1) = 87

Combine like terms:

6x - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:

6x = 96

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 16

Now that we know my brother's age is 16, we can find my age:

My age is x - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13

The answer is 13. 
4 steps problem. 

First, let's consider the information that I am 3 years younger than my brother.  Let's say my brother's age is x.  Then, my age is x - 3. 

The next piece of information is that I am 2 years older than my sister.  So, my sister's age is my age minus 2, which is (x - 3) - 2 = x - 5. 

We now have three variables: x, x-3, and x-5.  They all refer to my brother's age, my age, and my sister's age, respectively. 

The next piece of information is that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.  Since my brother's age is x, my mom's age is 3x - 1. 

Now, we are asked to find my age.  Let's add all our ages:

(x) + (x-3) + (x-5) + (3x-1) = 87

Combine like terms:

6x - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:

6x = 96

Divide by 6:

x = 16

So, my brother's age is 16.  Since I am 3 years younger than him, my age is 16 - 3 = 13.  The answer is 13.

[EXP] 457: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 27 students x 2 glue sticks for each student is 27 x 2 = 54 glue sticks.  Glue sticks come in packs of 8.  So he will need to buy (54 / 8) + 1 = 7 packs.  The answer is 7. 
27 students need 2 glue sticks each, so they need a total of 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.  If the glue sticks come in packs of 8, we need to figure out how many packs are needed.  To do this, we can divide 54 (the total number of glue sticks needed) by 8 (the number of glue sticks per pack).  54 / 8 = 6. 75.  Since Mr.  Jackson can only buy whole packs and expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.  The answer is 7. 
 Mr.  Jackson started with 27 students.  Each student needs 2 glue sticks.  So he needs 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.  The glue sticks come in packs of 8.  To find the number of packs he needs, we can divide 54 by 8, which is 6 with a remainder of 6.  We want to buy whole packs, so we need to buy 7 packs.  This will give him 7 * 8 = 56 glue sticks, which is 2 extra glue sticks.  The answer is 7. 
27 students will need 27 * 2 = 54 glue sticks.  Glue sticks come in packs of 8, so to find out how many packs we need, we divide 54 glue sticks by 8 glue sticks per pack.  54 / 8 = 6. 75.  Since we can only buy whole packs, we round up to the nearest whole number.  6. 75 rounds up to 7.  So we need 7 packs.  If there are 8 glue sticks per pack, and we buy 7 packs, we will have an extra 2 glue sticks.  The answer is 7. 
27 students need 2 glue sticks each.  27 x 2 = 54 glue sticks.  Glue sticks come in packs of 8.  We will need to know how many sets of 8 we need.  54 glue sticks / 8 per pack = 6. 75.  We can't buy a fraction of a pack, so we will buy the next whole number of packs, 7.  If we buy 7 packs, that is 7 x 8 = 56 glue sticks.  56 - 54 is 2.  So there will be 2 glue sticks left over.  The answer is 7. 
 Let's start by finding out how many glue sticks Mr.  Jackson needs in total.  If each student needs 2 glue sticks, and there are 27 students, then we multiply 2 glue sticks per student by 27 students:

2 x 27 = 54 glue sticks

Now, we need to find how many packs of 8 glue sticks we need to buy.  To do this, we can divide 54 glue sticks by 8:

54 ÷ 8 = 6. 75

Since we cannot buy a fraction of a pack, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.  This means we need to buy 7 packs of glue sticks, which will give us a total of:

7 x 8 = 56 glue sticks

We will have 2 extra glue sticks after giving each student their 2 glue sticks, but Mr.  Jackson can keep these extras in case some students need more.  The answer is 7.

[EXP] 458: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14000, [output]:  The amount of water passing through the river is initially 4000 gallons.  After a day of heavy rain, it doubles to 2*4000 = 8000 gallons.  On the third day, it increases by 6000 gallons.  So it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.  The answer is 14000. 
 The amount of water passing through the river at one point initially is 4000 gallons.  After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles, so now it is 2 x 4000 = 8000 gallons.  Then, on the third day, the amount of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons.  So it becomes 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.  The answer is 14000 gallons. 
4000 gallons of water is passing through the river at one point.  After the day of heavy rain, the water passing through doubles, so it is now 4000 * 2 = 8000 gallons.  The next day, it increases by 6000 gallons more.  8000 + 6000 = 14000.  The answer is 14000. 
4000 gallons is the initial amount of water.  If it doubles after a day of heavy rain, it becomes 2 x 4000 = 8000 gallons.  On the third day, the amount of water doubles again and increases by 6000 gallons.  The total amount of water is 8000 + 6000 = 14000.  The answer is 14000. 
4000 gallons of water were going through the river originally.  It doubles to 2 x 4000 = 8000 gallons.  On the third day, an additional 6000 gallons are added.  The total amount of water is 8000 + 6000 = 14000.  The answer is 14000. 
4000 gallons of water is passing through the river at one point.  If it doubles on the second day, that means there will be 4000 x 2 = 8000 gallons passing through the river on the second day.  On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons, so the total volume will be 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.  The answer is 14000. 
4000 gallons is the amount of water initially.  After the rain, it doubles and becomes 4000 x 2 = 8000 gallons.  

On the third day, the volume increased by 6000 gallons from the original amount, so the increase is added to the increased amount, not the original amount.  

So, 8000 + 6000 is 14000.  The answer is 14000.

[EXP] 459: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3430, [output]: 10 people are infected originally.  After one day, each of the 10 infects 6 others, so 10 * 6 = 60 people are infected.  10 + 60 = 70. 

On the second day, each of the 70 people infect 6 others, so 70 * 6 = 420 people are infected.  70 + 420 = 490. 

On the third day, each of the 490 people infect 6 others, so 490 * 6 = 2940 people are infected.  490 + 2940 = 3430. 

The answer is 3430. 
10 people are originally infected.  Each day, 6 new people are infected from each of the originally infected people.  So 6 * 10 = 60 new people are infected the first day.  After the first day, there are 10 + 60 = 70 people infected.  The same thing happens the second day.  6 * 70 = 420 new people are infected.  70 + 420 = 490 people infected.  The same thing happens the third day.  6 * 490 = 2940 new people are infected.  490 + 2940 = 3430 people infected.  The answer is 3430. 
10 people are infected initially.  Every day, each of them infects 6 others, so in the next day 10 * 6 = 60 people will be infected.  So the number of infected people will be 60 + 10 = 70.  In the second day, 70 people are infected and each infects 6, so 70 * 6 = 420 people will be infected.  So the total number of infected people will be 70 + 420 = 490.  In the third day, 490 people infect 6 each, so 490 * 6 = 2940 people will be infected.  So the total number of infected people will be 490 + 2940 = 3430.  The answer is 3430.

Since Julieta received 10% less, that means she received 10% of 800 dollars less, which is 0. 1 * 800 = 80 dollars.  So she received 800 - 80 = 720 dollars.  In total, they received 800 + 720 = 1520 dollars.  The answer is 1520. 
40 people gave Rafaela $20 each, so Rafaela received 40 x 20 = 800 dollars.  Since Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela, she received 90% of 800, which is 0. 9 x 800 = 720 dollars.  So, together they received 800 + 720 = 1520 dollars.  The answer is 1520. 
40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip each.  So Rafaela received 40 * 20 = 800 dollars in tips.  Julieta received 10% less than Rafaela.

[EXP] 462: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Claire earns 1 badge per month, so in a year she will earn 1 x 12 = 12 badges. 

Amber earns twice as slow as Claire, so she will earn 1/2 badge per month, and in a year she will earn 1/2 x 12 = 6 badges. 

Wendy earns 3 times as fast as Claire, so she will earn 3 badges per month, and in a year she will earn 3 x 12 = 36 badges. 

Wendy earns 36 badges and Amber earns 6 badges, so Wendy earns 36 - 6 = 30 badges more than Amber.  The answer is 30. 
1 year is 12 months.  So in 1 year, Claire earns 12 badges.  Since it takes Amber twice as long, Amber earns 12/2 = 6 badges.  Wendy earns 3 times more badges than Claire, so Wendy earns 12 * 3 = 36 badges.  The difference between Wendy and Amber is 36 - 6 = 30 badges.  The answer is 30. 
 Wendy earns three times as many badges as Claire.  Claire earns 1 badge each month, so Wendy earns 1 x 3 = 3 badges each month.  Amber takes twice as long as Claire, so she earns 1/2 badge each month.  In a 1-year time frame, Claire earns 1 badge each month for 12 months, so she earns 1 x 12 = 12 badges.  Amber earns 1/2 badge each month for 12 months, so she earns 1/2 x 12 = 6 badges.  The difference between Wendy's badges and Amber's badges is 3 x 12 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Let's start by understanding how many badges each person earns in a year.  Claire earns 1 badge per month, so she earns 12 badges in a year.  

Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire, which means Amber earns 1/2 badge per month.  In a year, she earns 1/2 * 12 = 6 badges. 

Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame, so Wendy earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year. 

Now, let's find how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber in a 1-year time frame.  Wendy has 36 badges, and Amber has 6 badges.  36 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30.

3.  They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars, so they have 10 x 3 = 30 blue cars. 
4.  In total, they have 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars that are red, green, or blue. 
5.  They have 75 cars in total, so the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 Let's break it down step by step:

1.  The rink has 12 red cars and 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10. 
2.  The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars, which is 10 * 3 = 30. 
3.  The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52. 
4.  The total number of cars is 75, so the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23. 

The answer is 23 yellow cars. 
 Let's start by finding the number of green cars.  We know there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so the number of green cars is 12 - 2 = 10. 

Then, we know that there are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars.  Since there are 10 green cars, there are 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars. 

The total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.  Since there are 75 cars in total, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 Let's start by knowing that there are 12 red cars.  We know there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there must be 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. 

We also know that there are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so there must be 10 x 3 = 30 blue cars. 

Adding up the number of red, green, and blue cars, we get 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars. 

Since there are 75 cars in total, that means there are 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars. 

The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step:

1.  There are 12 red cars. 
2.  There are 2 fewer green cars than red cars, so there are 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. 
3.  There are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so there are 10 x 3 = 30 blue cars. 
4.  Therefore, we know that the total number of red, green, and blue cars is 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars. 
5.  There are a total of 75 cars in the rink, so the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23. 

The answer is 23. 
 There are 12 red cars.  There are 2 fewer green cars, so 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.  There are 3 times as many blue cars as green cars, so 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.  The total number of cars is 12 + 10 + 30 + (unknown number of yellow cars) = 75.  To find the number of yellow cars, we can set up the equation 12 + 10 + 30 + y = 75, where y is the number of yellow cars.  Solve for y: 12 + 10 + 30 + y = 75 52 + y = 75 y = 75 - 52 y = 23 The number of yellow cars is 23.  The answer is 23. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

1.  The rink has 12 red cars.  They have 2 fewer green cars than they have red cars, so they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. 
2.  They have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars.  Since they have 10 green cars, they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars. 
3.  In total, they have red + green + blue cars.  That's 12 + 10 + 30 = 52 cars. 
4.  We know that the rink has 75 cars in total, and we already counted 52 cars, so we subtract 52 from 75 to find the number of yellow cars: 75 - 52 = 23. 

The answer is 23 yellow cars!.

[EXP] 467: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.  Let x be the number of books Anne has.  Sofie would then have x + 25. 

We're also given that Fawn has 12 more books than Anne, so Fawn has x + 12. 

The total number of books is 85, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) = 85

Combine like terms:

3x + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3x = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 16

So Anne has 16 books.  Sofie has 16 + 25 = 41 books.  And Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.  The answer is 28. 
85 books in total.  Sofie has 25 more than Anne.  This means if Anne's number of books is x, Sofie's is x + 25.  Fawn has 12 more books than Anne.  So Fawn has x + 12 books.  Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have a total of 85 books.  That means x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) is 85.  So 3x + 37 = 85.  We subtract 37 from both sides to get 3x = 48.  Then we divide by 3 on both sides to get x = 16.  So Fawn's number of books is x + 12, which is 16 + 12 = 28.  The answer is 28. 
 Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books together.  Let's start by identifying how many books Anne has.  Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, let's say Anne has x books.  Then Sofie has x + 25 books.  
  Sofie has x + 25 books
  Anne has x
  Fawn has x + 12 books

We know that x + (x + 25) + (x + 12) is equal to 85.  Combining like terms, we get 3x + 37 = 85.  Subtracting 37 from both sides, we get 3x = 48.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 16. 

Now that we know Anne has 16 books, we can figure out how many books Sofie has.  Sofie has 16 + 25 = 41 books.  And Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.  The answer is 28.

[EXP] 469: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 30 kids need 4 jello cups each, so a total of 30 x 4 = 120 jello cups are needed.  Each 3-ounce box of flavored jello makes 10 small jello cups, so Greg will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of flavored jello.  12 boxes will cost 12 x 1. 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
30 kids need 4 jello cups each.  So, they need a total of 30 * 4 = 120 jello cups.  Each box of jello makes 10 jello cups, so they need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  Each box is $1. 25, so they need 12 * 1. 25 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
30 kids x 4 jello cups each = 120 jello cups needed.  For each box of jello, you can make 10 small jello cups.  So to make 120 jello cups, you will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  Since each box of jello costs $1. 25, the total cost will be 12 x 1. 25 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
 We first figure out how much jello Greg needs in total.  There are 30 kids and each kid will have 4 jello cups, so in total, Greg needs 30 x 4 = 120 jello cups.  Since a 3-ounce box of jello makes 10 jello cups, he will need 120 / 10 = 12 boxes of jello.  Since each box costs $1. 25, the total cost will be 12 x $1. 25 = $15.  The answer is 15. 
 For each jello box, he can make 10 small jello cups.  If each kid needs 4 jello cups, and there are 30 kids, he needs 4 * 30 cups = 120 cups. 

Since each box can make 10 cups, we can see that 12 boxes of jello will be needed to make 120 cups (10 * 12 = 120). 

To buy 12 boxes of jello, it will cost 12 * 1. 25 = 15 dollars.

[EXP] 471: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 400 is the total monthly cost.  Madeline pays 60% of the cost.  So Keenan pays 40%.  400 x 0. 4 = 160.  Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Keenan pays 160 ÷ 4 = 40 dollars per week.  The answer is 40. 
400 dollars is the total cost of groceries per month.  If Madeline pays 60% of the cost, then Keenan pays 40%.  400 x 0. 4 = 160.  Now we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week.  Since there are 4 weeks in the month, we divide 160 by 4.  160 / 4 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
400 dollars per month.  Keenan pays the remaining 40% of the cost.  To find 40% of 400, multiply 40 by 400 divided by 100, which is 40 x 400 / 100 = 160.  Since it is a 4-week month, Keenan pays 160 / 4 dollars per week.  160 / 4 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
400 total dollars will be divided between 2 people.  If Madeline pays 60%, then Keenan pays 40%.  400 * 0. 40 = 160.  So Keenan pays 160.  Since it's a 4-week month, Keenan pays 160 / 4 = 40 dollars per week.  The answer is 40. 
60% of 400 is 400 x 0. 6 = 240.  That is how much Madeline pays.  So Keenan pays the remaining amount, which is 400 - 240 = 160.  Since they pay for a whole month, and there are 4 weeks in a month, we divide the total amount Keenan pays by 4.  160 / 4 = 40.  Keenan pays 40 dollars each week.  The answer is 40. 
 We start by identifying what Madeline pays.  She pays 60% of the total cost, so if the total cost is $400, she pays 400 x 0. 6 = $240.  Keenan, on the other hand, pays 100% - 60% = 40% of the cost, so 400 x 0. 4 = $160.  In a four-week month, they each pay their respective amount for 4 weeks.  So Keenan pays $160 / 4 = $40 per week.  The answer is 40. 
 Let's calculate the part Keenan pays first.  If Madeline pays 60% and Keenan pays the remaining 40%, the total cost of $400 can be split into 60% + 40% = 100%.  Now, we can convert 60% to a decimal by moving the decimal point two places to the left, since there are two zeros.  0. 6 x 400 = 240.  So Madeline pays 240.  400 - 240 = 160.  Keenan pays 160.  Since there are four weeks in this month, we can calculate Keenan's weekly cost by dividing 160 by 4.  160 ÷ 4 is 40.  The answer is 40.

He started with 60 and ate 34, so there are 60 - 34 = 26 pieces left.  On the 3rd day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces, which is 26 * 7/13 = 14 pieces.  So, in total, he ate 14 + 34 = 48 pizza pieces.  The answer is 48. 
60 is the total number of pieces.  

2/5 of 60 is equal to 60 * 2/5 = 60/5 * 2 = 12 * 2 = 24.  So Tobias ate 24 pieces on the first day. 
Then, he had 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.  He ate 10 pieces on the second day, leaving 36 - 10 = 26 pieces. 

On the third day, he ate 7/13 of the remaining 26 pieces.  7/13 of 26 is equal to 26 * 7/13 = 26/13 * 7 = 2 * 7 = 14.  So Tobias ate 14 pieces on the third day. 

The total number of pieces eaten is 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.  The answer is 48.

- Multiple-choice and true/false questions: Amy correctly answers 80% of 10 multiple-choice questions, which is 0. 8 x 10 = 8.  For 20 true/false questions, she correctly answers 90% of them, which is 0. 9 x 20 = 18. 
- Long-answer questions: Amy correctly answers 60% of 5 long-answer questions, which is 0. 6 x 5 = 3. 

The points for each type of question are:
- Multiple-choice and true/false questions: 8 + 18 = 26 points (1 point each)
- Long-answer questions: 3 x 5 = 15 points

Total points scored by Amy: 26 + 15 = 41.  The answer is 41. 
1st, calculate the total number of multiple-choice and true/false questions: 10 multiple-choice + 20 true/false = 30 questions.  Amy correctly answers 80% of the multiple-choice questions, so she gets 10 x 80% = 8 multiple-choice correct.  Amy corrects 90% of the true/false questions, so she gets 20 x 90% = 18 true/false correct.  So for the multiple-choice questions, she gets 8 x 1 = 8 points.  For the true/false questions, she gets 18 x 1 = 18 points.  8 + 18 = 26 points.  2nd, calculate the number of long-answer questions she gets right: Amy gets 60% of the long-answer questions right, so 5 x 60% = 3 long-answer questions.  She gets 3 x 5 = 15 points for those questions.  3rd, total the points Amy gets for the test: 26 points for multiple-choice and true/false questions + 15 points for long-answer questions = 41 points.  The answer is 41. 
 Amy will first count the points for the multiple-choice and true/false questions.  There are 10 multiple-choice questions and the answers are 80% correct, so that is 0. 8 * 10 = 8 correct.  8 correct out of 10 represents 8 points.  There are 20 true/false questions and the answers are 90% correct, so that is 0. 9 * 20 = 18 correct.  18 correct out of 20 represents 18 points.  Multiplying 8 + 18, we get 26 points.  There are 5 long-answer questions, and Amy got 60% of them correct, so she got 0. 6 * 5 = 3 correct.  Each correct long-answer question is worth 5 points, so she got 3 * 5 = 15 points.  Adding 15 to 26, we get 41 points.  The answer is 41.

[EXP] 479: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 32 glasses of lemonade were sold.  Julie sold 14 glasses.  So the boys together sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.  Since they sold an equal number of glasses, Micah and Mitchell each sold 9 glasses.  The difference is 14 - 9 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
32 glasses were sold.  Julie sold 14 glasses.  Since the boys sold an equal number, they sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses in total.  So Micah and Mitchell each sold 18/2 = 9 glasses.  To find how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah, subtract the number of glasses Micah sold from the number Julie sold: 14 - 9 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
32 glasses were sold in total.  Julie sold 14 glasses.  If the boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold an equal number of glasses, then they sold half of the remaining glasses.  There are 32 - 14 = 18 glasses left.  Half of 18 is 9.  So Micah sold 9 glasses.  Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses, so Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 glasses more than Micah.  The answer is 5. 
32 glasses were sold.  14 were sold by Julie.  So the number of glasses sold by the 2 boys is 32 - 14 = 18.  Since the boys sold an equal number, each boy sold 18/2 = 9 glasses.  Julie sold 14 and the boys sold 9 each.  So Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.  The answer is 5. 
32 glasses were sold in total, by Julie and the two boys.  Julie sold 14, and the boys sold an equal number of glasses.  So the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses divided evenly, which is 9 each.  Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.  The answer is 5. 
32 glasses were sold in total.  Julie sold 14 glasses.  The 2 boys, Micah and Mitchell, sold an equal number, so that's 32 - 14 = 18 glasses together.  If they split the remaining glasses equally, they each sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.  Julie sold 14, while Micah and Mitchell each sold 9.  The difference is 14 - 9 = 5.  The answer is 5.

[EXP] 480: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 575, [output]: 400 was spent to do her hair.  For the manicure, she spent 1/4 of 400, which is 400/4 = 100.  For the pedicure, she spent 3/4 as much as for the manicure, so it's 3/4 * 100 = 75.  In total, 400 + 100 + 75 = 575.  The answer is 575. 
400 dollars is the amount Iris spent on her hair.  1/4 as much as 400 is 400/4 = 100, so she spent 100 dollars on a manicure.  3/4 as much as 100 is 3/4 x 100 = 75, so she spent 75 dollars on a pedicure.  To add these amounts, we get 400 + 100 + 75 = 575.  The answer is 575. 
400 dollars was spent on her hair.  1/4 of 400 dollars is 400/4 = 100.  So she spent 100 dollars for the manicure.  3/4 of 100 dollars is 300/4 = 75.  So she spent 75 dollars for the pedicure.  Adding all together, 400 + 100 + 75 = 575 dollars.  The answer is 575. 
 I will solve this problem following the previous examples. 

First, Iris spent $400 on her hair.  Then she spent 1/4 as much on her manicure, which is 400 / 4 = 100 dollars.  Finally, she spent 3/4 as much as the manicure on her pedicure, which is 3/4 * 100 = 75 dollars. 

Then, I add the amount she spent on her hair, manicure, and pedicure:
400 + 100 + 75 = 575

The answer is 575. 
 Let's start by determining how much Iris spent on the manicure.  Since she spent 1/4 as much on the manicure as she did on her hair, which was $400, the manicure cost 400 * 1/4 = 100 dollars. 

Then, we know that the pedicure cost 3/4 as much as the manicure, which is 100 * 3/4 = 75 dollars. 

To find the total amount she spent at the spa, we add the costs of the hair treatment, manicure, and pedicure: 400 + 100 + 75 = 575. 

The answer is 575.

[EXP] 481: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Sarah had 20 meters of rope.  Her friend wants to buy the rope at 2 dollars a meter.  20 * 2 = 40 dollars.  She gets 40 dollars and her new rope is 1. 5 dollars a meter.  1. 5 * 20 = 30.  So she has 40 - 30 = 10 dollars left over.  The answer is 10. 
1.  Sarah starts with a rope that costs $2 a meter and is 20 meters long.  So the rope is worth 20 x 2 = $40. 

2.  She buys a new rope that costs $1. 5 a meter and is also 20 meters long.  So the new rope costs 20 x 1. 5 = $30. 

3.  She uses the profit from selling the old rope (40 - 30 = 10 dollars) to buy the new rope. 

4.  So, she has 10 dollars left over after buying the new rope.  The answer is 10.

[EXP] 482: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Melanie is 8 years old currently.  She will be 18 in 10 years. 

To find when her age will be thrice her present age, we have to find when she will be 24 years old.  Since she is currently 8, she will be 24 in 24 - 8 = 16 years. 

The answer is 16. 
 Since Melanie will be 18 in 10 years, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8.  If her age will be thrice her present age, it means it will be 8 * 3 = 24.  So, from now on, she will be 24 in some time.  But we want to know how many years later.  So, 24 - 8 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
 Let's start with Melanie's current age.  We don't know what it is, but we can represent it as x. 

Since in 10 years she will be 18, her current age is 18 - 10 = 8. 

Now, we want to find in how many years her age will be thrice her present age.  This means we need to find when she'll be 24 (3 x 8). 

To do this, we subtract her current age from 24:

24 - 8 = 16

This means in 16 years, her age will be thrice her present age. 

The answer is 16. 
 Let's figure out Melanie's present age.  She will be 18 in 10 years, so if we subtract 10 from 18, we get 8.  That means her present age is 8.  

Now, Melanie's age in the future will be three times her present age.  We do 8 x 3 = 24.  So, when her age will be thrice her present age is 24.  Since she is 8 years old now, we subtract 8 from 24 to get 16.  The answer is 16.

2.  The 3 packs of strawberries cost 3 x 4 = 12 dollars. 
3.  The 7 packs of apples cost 7 x (4 / 2) = 14 dollars. 
4.  Total cost = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars. 
5.  Kelly's budget is 65 dollars.  So, 65 - 60 = 5 dollars.  The answer is 5. 
1.  Kelly bought 5 packs of bacon for $10.  2.  She bought 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as bacon.  Bacon costs $2, so chicken cost $2 x 2 = $4.  6 chicken packets will cost 6 x 4 = 24 dollars.  3.  She bought 3 packs of strawberries for $4 each.  3 x 4 = 12.  4.  She bought 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a strawberry.  Strawberries cost $4, so apples cost $2.  7 apples will cost 7 x 2 = 14 dollars. 

In total, Kelly spent 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars.  Since her budget is 65 dollars, she has 65 - 60 = 5 dollars left in her budget.  The answer is 5.

65 - 15 is 50.  So the concert, without encore, is 50 minutes long.  This is twice the usual length, so the usual length is 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.  The answer is 25. 
 Elaina holds a concert.  The usual concert is x minutes long.  The final concert is twice as long as usual, which is 2x.  She also does a 15-minute encore.

125 + 125 + (125 * 2) = ?

First, let's add the number of chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays: 125 + 125 = 250. 

Then, we multiply the number of chimichangas on Tuesdays and Wednesdays by 2 to get the number of chimichangas on Fridays: 125 * 2 = 250. 

Finally, we add the total number of chimichangas on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: 250 + 250 = 500. 

The answer is 500. 
125 on Tuesdays, 125 on Wednesdays.  On Friday, they make 2 times the number on Tuesdays.  So they make 2 x 125 = 250 chimichangas on Friday.  In total, they make 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 chimichangas.  The answer is 500.

50 microphones, 20% of which won't fit.  What is 20% of 50? 50 x 0. 2 = 10.  So 10 microphones won't fit.  That leaves 50 - 10 = 40 microphones.  40 microphones can be arranged in 40/2 = 20 pairs.  The answer is 20. 
50 microphones originally.  After arranging in pairs, 20% won't fit.  20% of 50 is 20/100 * 50 = 10.  So 10 microphones won't fit.  50 - 10 = 40.  The number of microphones that fit in pairs is 40.  So the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
50 microphones are available to arrange.  20% of these will not fit, so that leaves 100% - 20% = 80%.  80% of 50 is 40 microphones.  These 40 microphones are arranged in pairs, so the number of pairs is 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.  The answer is 20. 
50 microphones and 20% won't fit.  So 0. 2 * 50 = 10 microphones won't fit.  That leaves 50 - 10 = 40 microphones to be arranged.  If arranging in pairs means dividing the 40 microphones by 2, then 40 / 2 = 20 pairs.  The answer is 20. 
50 microphones need to be arranged in pairs.  20% of the microphones won't fit, so we need to find 20% of 50.  20% is the same as 0. 2, so 0. 2 * 50 = 10.  The remaining number of microphones after 10 didn't fit is 50 - 10 = 40.  We want to find the number of pairs we can make with 40 microphones.  40 divided by 2 is 20.  The answer is 20. 
50 microphones are the original amount.  Since 20% of the microphones won't find any space, that means the singer will arrange 80% of the microphones.  50 * 0. 80 = 40 microphones.  Since the singer wants to arrange them in pairs, we are looking for the number of pairs of this amount.  40 / 2 = 20.  The answer is 20.

To find the percent of flowers, convert the number of flowers to a decimal by dividing by 100.  25 / 100 = 0. 25.  To convert to a percent, multiply by 100.  0. 25 x 100 = 25%.

100 is the total number of plants.  One-fourth of the plants are indoor, so one-fourth of 100 is 25.  So, 25 plants are indoor.  Then there are 100 - 25 = 75 plants left.  Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor.  Two-thirds of 75 is (2 / 3) x 75 = 50.  So 50 plants are outdoor.  The rest, 75 - 50 = 25 plants, are flowering plants. 

Let's find the percent of plants that are flowering:

(25 / 100) x 100 = 25%

The answer is 25%. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

1.  One-fourth of her plants are indoor plants. 
Since 1/4 of the plants are indoor, we can find the number of indoor plants:
100 x (1/4) = 25 indoor plants

2.  Two-thirds of the remaining plants are outdoor plants. 
To find the remaining plants, subtract the indoor plants from the total:
100 - 25 = 75
Then, 2/3 of the remaining plants are outdoor plants:
75 x (2/3) = 50 outdoor plants

3.  The rest are flowering plants. 
To find the number of flowering plants, subtract the indoor and outdoor plants from the total:
100 - (25 + 50) = 25 flowering plants

4.  Find the percentage of flowering plants:
Number of flowering plants = 25
Total plants = 100
Percentage = (Number of flowering plants / Total plants) x 100
= (25 / 100) x 100
= 25%

So, what percent of the plants are flowering plants? The answer is 25%. 
1/4 of the plants are indoor plants, so the number of indoor plants is 100 / 4 = 25.  That means the number of outdoor/planting plants is 100 - 25 = 75.  Of those, 2/3 are outdoor plants, so the number of outdoor plants is 75 * 2/3 = 50.  The rest, which are flowering plants, are 75 - 50 = 25.  We want to find the percent of plants that are flowering.  To do this, we divide the number of flowering plants by the total number of plants and then multiply by 100.  So, 25 / 100 * 100 = 25%.  The answer is 25%. 
 There are 100 plants in Mrs.  Smith's garden.  A quarter of them are indoor plants, which is 100 ÷ 4 = 25 plants.  The remaining are 100 - 25 = 75.  Two-thirds of the 75 remaining are outdoor plants, so 75 * 2/3 = 50 are outdoor plants.  The remaining are 75 - 50 = 25 flowering plants.  We can find the percentage by dividing the flowering plants by the total plants: 25 / 100 = 0. 25 = 25%.  The answer is 25%.

[EXP] 492: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 55, [output]:  The thingamabob spins at some speed x.  The whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than the thingamabob, so it spins at x * 11.  The whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, so x * 11 = 121.  To find x, we can do 121 / 11 = 11.  Then the thingamabob spins at 11 meters per second.  The whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of the thingamabob, so it spins at 11 * 5 = 55 meters per second.

[EXP] 493: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Ellen spends 6 dollars on salad and 6/2 = 3 dollars on yogurt.  So she spends 6 + 3 = 9 dollars on salad and yogurt.  If the total is 11 dollars, then the carrots cost 11 - 9 = 2 dollars.  Since she eats 2 carrots a day, the cost per carrot is 2/2 = 1 dollar.  The answer is 1. 
 Ellen eats 2 carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.  The salad costs 6 dollars, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad.  So the yogurt costs 6 / 2 = 3 dollars.  In total, she pays 6 + 3 + 2 * x = 11 for her goods.  Since we know she pays 11, we can set up the equation:

6 + 3 + 2x = 11

Simplifying the equation:

11 - 6 - 3 = 2x

2 = 2x

x = 1

So Ellen pays 1 dollar for each carrot every day.  The answer is 1. 
 Ellen's diet consists of 3 components: 2 carrots and a salad + yogurt.  The salad costs $6, and the yogurt is half the price of the salad, which means it costs $3.  So, in total, Ellen pays 6 + 3 = 9 dollars for the salad and yogurt.  She paid 11 dollars in total.  This means she paid 11 - 9 = 2 dollars for the 2 carrots.  This means she pays $1 for one carrot.  The answer is 1.

[EXP] 495: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  

Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.  If Joe paid Tasha $6 for her work, then she made 6 dollars from Joe's lawn.  

The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's.  So she made 3 x 6 = 18 dollars from Kamala's lawn. 

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as she did Joe's.  So she made 5 x 6 = 30 dollars from Alba's lawn. 

So, she made 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 dollars from mowing lawns.  Since she made 80 dollars total, she made 80 - 54 = 26 dollars from lemonade sales.  The answer is 26. 
 Tasha made 80 dollars total.  She has 80 - 6 = 74 dollars left from other jobs.  

Tasha mowed the lawns as follows:
   Kamala: 3 times
   Joe: 1 time
   Alba: 5 times

To find which lawn she mowed 1 time, pretend you have the equation:
3 + 1 + x = 5
The 3 and 1 are known, and x is the times she mowed the other lawn. 
3 + 1 = 4, then 4 + x = 5, so x must be 5 - 4 = 1.  The bank of the creek is where Tasha mowed one time. 

For Kamala, she mowed 3 times, so she earned 3 * 6 = 18 dollars.  

For Joe, she mowed 1 time, so she earned 1 * 6 = 6 dollars.  

For Alba, she mowed 5 times, so she earned 5 * 6 = 30 dollars.  

In total, she earned 18 + 6 + 30 = 54 dollars from lawn work.  

So she must have earned 80 - 54 = 26 dollars from lemonade sales.  The answer is 26.

Then, Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg. 

Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg. 

The answer is 74. 
 Let's break it down step by step:

Martin's weight is 55 kg. 

Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg. 

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg. 

Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg. 

The answer is 74 kg. 
 Martin's weight is 55 kg.  Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's, so Carl weighs 55 + 16 = 71 kg.  Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's, so Christian weighs 71 + 8 = 79 kg.  Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's, so Harry weighs 79 - 5 = 74 kg.  The answer is 74. 
 Let's start by finding Carl's weight.  Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight, which is 55 kg, so Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg. 

Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight, so Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg. 

Harry's weight is 5 kg less than Christian's weight, so Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg. 

The answer is 74. 
 Let's calculate the weight of Carl by adding 16 kg to Martin's weight: 55 kg + 16 kg = 71 kg. 

Then, add 8 kg to Carl's weight to get Christian's weight: 71 kg + 8 kg = 79 kg. 

Finally, subtract 5 kg from Christian's weight to get Harry's weight: 79 kg - 5 kg = 74 kg.

[EXP] 497: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  John rents his car 10 times a month.  For each rental, he gets paid 3 * 25 = 75 dollars.  So in total, he gets paid 10 * 75 = 750 dollars.  He has to pay 500 dollars in car payment.  So his profit is the amount he makes - the amount he pays in car payment, which is 750 - 500 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
 John rents his car out 10 times.  Each time, it is rented for 3 hours.  So the total rent is 10 * 3 = 30 hours.  At $25 an hour, that is 30 * 25 = 750 dollars.  But John has to pay a $500 car payment.  So he has 750 - 500 = 250 dollars profit.  The answer is 250. 
10 times a month is how many times he rents out the car.  10 times 3 hours each is 10 x 3 = 30 hours.  He gets paid 25 dollars per hour.  So he makes 25 * 30 dollars in total.  25 * 30 = 750.  But he has a car payment of 500 dollars.  So his profit is 750 - 500 = 250 dollars.  The answer is 250. 
 John rents his car 10 times a month.   For 3 hours each time, that is 10 * 3 = 30 hours he gets paid for.   He gets paid $25 an hour so he gets paid 30 * 25 = 750 dollars.   His car payment is 500 dollars, so subtract that from the amount he made, 750 - 500 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
 John has the car payment of 500 dollars.  He rents the car out 10 times a month.  For each of 3 hours, he gets 25 dollars, so for each rental he gets 3 * 25 = 75 dollars.  If he rents it out 10 times, he gets 10 * 75 = 750 dollars.  If his car payment is 500, then the profit he makes is 750 - 500 = 250 dollars.  The answer is 250. 
 John rents his car 10 times a month, and each time for 3 hours.   So total hours he gets paid are 3 * 10 = 30 hours.   He gets paid $25 per hour, so his total earnings are 30 * 25 = 750 dollars.   However, he pays $500 car payment.   750 - 500 = 250.   He has $250 profit on his car.   The answer is 250.

[EXP] 498: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Let's start by figuring out how many notebooks Martha had originally.  She had 7 notebooks after buying 5 more, so before buying 5 more notebooks she had 7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.  Since Joseph had 3 times as many as Martha, he had 2 x 3 = 6 notebooks.  To find out how many more notebooks Martha has now than Joseph, we can subtract Joseph's number of notebooks from Martha's: 7 - 6 = 1.  The answer is 1. 
 Since Martha started with a certain amount of notebooks and then bought 5 more, we can find the number of notebooks she had initially by subtracting the 5 notebooks she bought from the total 7 notebooks she has now.  7 - 5 = 2 notebooks.  

Since Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha initially, that means that Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as 2, which is 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks. 

To find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph, we subtract the number of notebooks Joseph has from the number of notebooks Martha has.  7 - 6 = 1.  The answer is 1. 
 Let's think about this step by step! Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.  That means if Martha had some number of notebooks, let's call it x, Joseph would have 3x notebooks.  Martha had 7 notebooks after buying 5 more.  So before buying, she had 7 - 5 = 2.  Since Joseph had 3x and Martha had x, Joseph must have had 3 * 2 = 6.  Now we need to find out how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph.  Martha has 7 and Joseph has 6, so Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.  The answer is 1.

100 cookies were originally made.  4 were eaten by Susan's husband, so 100 - 4 = 96 cookies are left.  These 96 cookies need to be divided among 6 nephews.  To find out how many each nephew gets, we do 96 ÷ 6.  96 ÷ 6 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
100 cookies were originally made.  Susan's husband snuck 4 cookies.  So there are 100 - 4 = 96 cookies remaining.  They need to be divided between 6 nephews.  To find out how many each nephew will get, we divide 96 by 6.  96 / 6 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
100 cookies originally, minus 4 cookies taken by Susan's husband, means she had 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.  She has 6 nephews, so she needs to divide 96 cookies equally among them.  To find the number of cookies each nephew will get, we can divide 96 by 6: 96 ÷ 6 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
100 cookies initially.  4 were taken by Susan's husband, so we subtract 4 from the initial amount: 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.  We'll divide the 96 cookies equally among 6 nephews.  To divide 96 cookies among 6, we do 96 / 6 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
 Susan originally made 100 cookies.  Her husband took 4 before she could package them.  So Susan now has 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.  If she is going to equally divide them between her 6 nephews, we need to find 96 / 6.

2 yards of material is enough for 4 small masks, so 1 yard is enough for 2 small masks.  To make 20 small masks, 20/2 = 10 yards of material would be needed.  3 large masks can be made with 2. 25 yards, so 1 large mask takes 2. 25/3 = 0. 75 yards.  To make 8 large masks, we need 8 * 0. 75 = 6 yards of material.  10 + 6 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
2 yards of material can be used to make either 4 small masks or 3 large masks.  We need to figure out how much material will be used for 20 small masks and 8 large masks. 

Let's start with 20 small masks.  Since 2 yards of material makes 4 small masks, 1 yard of material makes 2 small masks, and 20 small masks will need 10 yards of material. 

Now, let's calculate the material needed for the 8 large masks.  Since 2. 25 yards of material makes 3 large masks, 1 yard of material makes 1. 33 large masks (2. 25 / 2 = 1. 125; 1. 125 * 3 = 3. 375; 3. 375 / 3 = 1. 125), and 8 large masks will need 6 yards of material (8 / 1. 33 = 6).

[EXP] 510: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Duncan's age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.  

Duncan's age eight years ago was equal to 2 times Adam's age four years ago.  So Adam's age four years ago is 52 / 2 = 26. 

Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30.  If we add 8 more years, he will be 38.  The answer is 38. 
 Let's start by saying that Duncan's current age is 60 years old.  Since his age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago, we can set up an equation:

60 - 8 = 2(Adam's age 4 years ago)

This simplifies to:

52 = 2(Adam's age 4 years ago)

To solve for Adam's age 4 years ago, we can divide both sides by 2:

52 / 2 = Adam's age 4 years ago

This gives us:

26 = Adam's age 4 years ago

Since Adam's age 4 years ago was 26, we can add 4 to find his current age:

26 + 4 = 30

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we can add 8 to his current age:

30 + 8 = 38

The answer is 38. 
 Let's start by analyzing the problem.  We know Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, and we know Duncan's current age is 60.  We can use this information to set up an equation. 

Let x be Duncan's age eight years ago.  Then Adam's age four years ago is x/2, since his age was half of Duncan's age. 

Duncan's current age is 60, so 60 = x + 8.  Solve for x:

x = 52

So Duncan's age eight years ago was 52.  Since Adam's age four years ago was x/2, his age four years ago was 52/2 = 26. 

Now we need to find Adam's age in 8 years.  His current age is 26 + 4 = 30, so his age in 8 years will be 30 + 8 = 38. 

The answer is 38. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's say Adam's age four years ago was x.  Since Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, Duncan's age eight years ago was 2x. 

Now, let's think about Adam's current age and Duncan's current age.  Since they have a certain age difference, let's think about their current ages in terms of their previous ages. 

Duncan's current age is 60, and eight years ago, he was 2x.  So, his current age is 60, and eight years ago, he was 60 - 8 = 52.  Since Duncan's age eight years ago was 52, we can set up the equation 52 = 2x. 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: x = 26. 

Now, we can think about Adam's current age.  Four years ago, Adam was x, which is 26.  So, Adam's current age is 26 + 4 = 30. 

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we can add 8 to his current age: 30 + 8 = 38. 

The answer is 38.

[EXP] 511: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.  Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that.  Twice of 200 acres is 2 x 200 = 400 acres.  Then 100 acres more is 400 + 100 = 500.  The total number of acres is 200 + 500 = 700.  The answer is 700. 
 Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres.  Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that.  So farmer Smith's farm is 2 * 200 + 100 = 500 acres.  To find out how many acres the two farms have together, we add 200 and 500.  200 + 500 = 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
 We know that Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm.  Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres.  Twice that is 2 * 200 = 400 acres.  So 100 more than that is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.  200 + 500 = 700.  The farms together have 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres. 
Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that.  To find out how many acres that is, we can calculate 2 times the number of acres Farmer Brown has: 2 x 200 = 400. 

Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than 400 acres.  So, we add 100 to 400: 400 + 100 = 500 acres. 

Now, we need to find out how many acres the two farms have together.  We add the acres of both farms: 200 (Farmer Brown) + 500 (Farmer Smith) = 700 acres. 

The answer is 700.

[EXP] 514: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total.  Of those, 20 were for the red balloons.  Each red balloon needs 2 pieces of bologna.  So 20 red balloons multiplied by 2 bologna per balloon is 40 bologna.  58 - 40 = 18 bologna left.  Each yellow balloon needs 3 bologna.  18 divided by 3 is 6.  The answer is 6. 
 Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of balloons.  20 of the balloons were red, so the 2 pieces of bologna thrown at each red balloon is 20 * 2 = 40.  So the remaining pieces of bologna (58 - 40 = 18) were thrown at the yellow balloons.  Each yellow balloon had 3 pieces of bologna, so 18 ÷ 3 = 6.  6 yellow balloons.  The answer is 6. 
58 pieces of bologna were thrown in total.  It is known that 2 slices of bologna were thrown at each red balloon and 3 slices of bologna at each yellow one.  The number of red balloons is 20.  

The amount of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 2 * 20 = 40.  The number of bologna left which was not thrown at red balloons is 58 - 40 = 18.  Each yellow balloon was given 3 slices of bologna.  If 3 slices of bologna were given at each yellow balloon, the amount given at the yellow balloons will be 18.  To calculate the number of yellow balloons, the result of 3 times the number is calculated: 3 * x = 18.  The equation is solved by dividing 18 by 3.  18 / 3 = 6.  Therefore, the number of yellow balloons in the bundle is 6.  The answer is 6.

30 days at 100 miles per day will be 30 x 100 = 3000 miles.  Since the car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles, to find the number of tune-ups needed, divide the total miles by 1000.  3000 / 1000 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
 Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  In 30 days, he drives 100 miles a day.  100 x 30 = 3000 miles.  To find out how many 1000-mile increments he drives, we can divide 3000 by 1000.  3000 / 1000 = 3.  So, Jon's car needs 3 tune-ups.  The answer is 3. 
 Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days.  So the total distance driven is 30 x 100 = 3000 miles.  To find the number of tune-ups, we divide the total distance driven by the distance for each tune-up, 1000.  3000 ÷ 1000 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
1000 is the distance after which Jon's car needs a tune-up.  100 miles a day for a 30 day month means Jon drove a total distance of 30 x 100 = 3000 miles.  So he needs 3000 / 1000 = 3 tuneups.  The answer is 3. 
 Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles.  He drives 100 miles a day and for 30 days, so he drives a total of 100 x 30 = 3000 miles.  The number of tune-ups required equals the total miles divided by 1000, which is 3000 ÷ 1000 = 3.  The answer is 3.

[EXP] 517: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Julia and Nadine bought a cake for 11 dollars.  Then they bought balloons.  Since 2 balloons cost 0. 5 dollars, 12 balloons (1 dozen) will cost 12 x 0. 5 = 6 dollars.  Later they bought 2 tubs of ice cream for 7 dollars each, which is 2 x 7 = 14 dollars.  In total they spent 11 + 6 + 14 dollars, which is 31 dollars.  So they must have had 31 dollars in total.  Since they were given the same amount of allowance, they must have each gotten half of 31.  Half of 31 is 15. 5.  The answer is 15. 5. 
 First, we will calculate out how much they spent on the cake and balloons.  The cake cost 11 dollars.  1 dozen balloons are 12 balloons.  For 2 balloons, they spend 0. 5 dollars each, so for 12 balloons they will spend 12 x 0. 5 = 6 dollars.  Now we have 11 + 6 = 17 dollars spent on the cake and balloons.  For ice cream, two tubs cost 7 dollars each, so 2 x 7 = 14 dollars.  Total spent is 17 + 14 = 31 dollars.  This was all their allowance, so they must have started with 31 dollars combined.  Since they got the same amount, they must have each gotten 31 / 2 = 15. 5 dollars.  The answer is 15. 5.

 Martha started collecting shells at age 5, and by her 10th birthday, that means she collected for 5 years.  She collects one shell each month.  So in 5 years, she'll collect 5 x 12 = 60 shells.  The answer is 60. 
 Martha started collecting shells at 5 years old, and she is now 10 years old.  That means she collected shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.  She collects 1 shell every month.  So, in 5 years, she will collect 5 x 12 = 60 shells.  The answer is 60. 
 Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old.  She collects one shell each month, so that means from 5 to 10, she collected shells for 5 years, which is 60 months.  60 months times 1 shell per month is 60 shells.  The answer is 60. 
 Martha started collecting shells when she turned 5 years old.  Since then, she has been collecting one shell every month.  To get to her 10th birthday, that means she has been collecting shells for 5 years.  Since there are 12 months in a year, she has collected 12 shells each year.  So in 5 years, she would have collected 12 * 5 = 60 shells.  The answer is 60. 
 Martha has been collecting shells since she turned 5 years old, and this is happening on her 10th birthday.  That means she is collecting shells for 10 - 5 = 5 years.  For each year, she collects 12 shells (one per month).  So she collects 12 * 5 = 60 shells over 5 years.  The answer is 60.

[EXP] 524: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2, [output]: 27 cups are initially divided into 3 rows.  So the number of cups in each row is 27 / 3 = 9 cups.  The remaining cups are used for cinnamon tea, which is 15 cups.  So the number of cups for chamomile and mint tea is 27 - 15 = 12 cups.  These 12 cups are divided into 3 rows.  So the number of mint tea cups in each row is 12 / 3 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
27 cups of tea were divided into 3 rows, so there are 27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.  If we take 15 cups for cinnamon tea, that leaves 27 - 15 = 12 cups.  These 12 cups must be split equally between the 3 rows, so that is 12 / 3 = 4 cups in each row for chamomile tea.  Since the rows must have equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.  The answer is 4. 
27 cups of tea divided into 3 rows means there are 27 / 3 = 9 cups in each row.  Then, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.  So, in each row, she will have 9 / 2 = 4. 5 cups of each, which can be written as 4 cups.  The remaining cups are used to brew 15 cups of cinnamon tea, so the remaining cups are 27 - 15 = 12 cups.  Since this is 3 rows, each row has 12 / 3 = 4 remaining cups.  Since 4 cups of each row are mint tea, the answer is 4. 
27 cups total with some for mint tea, some for chamomile tea, and rest for cinnamon tea.  Let's find out what's left for mint tea and chamomile tea.  A total of 15 cups were used for cinnamon tea.  So that leaves 27 - 15 = 12 cups of tea.  Now these 12 cups are divided into 3 rows and each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea.  So 12 is divided into 3 parts.  12 / 3 = 4.  Since each part contains both mint and chamomile tea, there are 4 cups of mint tea in each row.  The answer is 4. 
27 cups of tea are divided into 3 rows.  So, in each row, there will be 27 / 3 = 9 cups of tea.  This means 9 cups of each kind of tea, chamomile and mint, are in each row.  The remaining cups after the 3 rows are 9 cups for cinnamon tea.  So, 27 - 15 = 12 cups are remaining.  In each row, there are 9 cups for each kind of tea, and 3 rows.  9 * 3 = 27.  We know 12 are remaining out of the initial 27 cups.  Therefore, 9 cups of tea is not from the remaining 12 cups.  The remaining 12 cups are actually from the initial 27, implying they are also divided into 3 rows.  The initial 27 cups are 15 for cinnamon and 12/3 = 4 for each kind of tea in each row.  The answer is 4.

[EXP] 525: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  The sloth will make 8/4 = 2 trips in 8 hours.  He picks the same number of berries on each trip.  So in total, he will pick 2 times the same number of berries.  To collect 24 berries, that number of berries must be 24/2 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
4 hours is one trip.  The sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  8 hours is 2 trips.  Each trip takes 4 hours.  So the sloth makes one trip every 4 hours.  There are 2 trips in 8 hours.  During two trips, he must collect 24 berries.  In one trip, he collects half of 24 berries.  Half of 24 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
24 berries in 8 hours means that the sloth will go down to the ground 8 / 4 = 2 times in those 8 hours.  So the sloth makes 2 trips down to the ground.  Each trip the sloth picks the same number of berries.  Let's say he picks x berries per trip.  So in total, he picks 2x berries in 2 trips.  The problem gives us the equation 2x = 24.  To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2 and get x = 12.  The sloth picks 12 berries per trip.  The answer is 12.

The tank is then emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.  In 6 days, the tank will be emptied by 6 * 500 = 3000 gallons.  So there will be 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons remaining in the tank.  The answer is 2000. 
10000 gallons of water are in the pool.  Half of 10000 is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.  The tank was filled with this amount of water.  After 6 days, the tank is depleted at a rate of 500 gallons per day, so 6 x 500 = 3000 gallons are used.  5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons will be remaining in the tank.  The answer is 2000. 
10000 gallons of water is filled into the tank.  Since half the amount of water in the pool is placed into the tank, that is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.  The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.  In 6 days, the tank will be emptied by 500 * 6 = 3000 gallons.  So after 6 days, the tank will have 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons of water left.  The answer is 2000 gallons. 
10000 gallons of water were in the pool originally.  10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons were put into the tank.  So the tank was initially filled with 5000 gallons.  At the end of each day, the tank loses 500 gallons.  5000 - 500 = 4500 gallons left in the tank, then 4500 - 500 = 4000 gallons left, and so on.  

After 6 days, the tank has lost 500 gallons each day for 6 days.  So 500 x 6 = 3000 gallons are gone.  So now the tank has 5000 - 3000 gallons left.  5000 - 3000 is 2000.  The answer is 2000.

[EXP] 527: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Let's break this problem into parts. 
Colby's parents give him $150.  He has 5 movies to account for (Friday and Saturdays), 8 movies to account for (other days), 2 tubs of popcorn, and 4 boxes of candy. 
First, let's calculate how much Colby has spent. 

For 5 movies on Fridays and Saturdays (10 dollars each), that's 5 x 10 = 50. 
For 8 movies on other days (7 dollars each), that's 8 x 7 = 56. 
For 2 tubs of popcorn (8 dollars each), that's 2 x 8 = 16. 
For 4 boxes of candy (2 dollars each), that's 4 x 2 = 8. 

Total money spent is 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130.  Colby has 150 - 130 = 20 dollars left. 

Since one movie costs $10 and he only has 20 dollars left, he can still see 2 more movies (20 / 10 = 2). 
The answer is 2.

[EXP] 532: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Let "x" be the age of John.  Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is x + 10. 

The problem states that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age.  So, Peter's age is (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100.  We can set up the equation:

2x + 10 + x = 100

Combine like terms:

3x + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3x = 90

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 30

So John's age is 30. 

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:

Paul's age = x + 10 = 30 + 10 = 40

Finally, we can find Peter's age using the equation:

Peter's age = 2x + 10 = 2(30) + 10 = 60 + 10 = 70

The answer is 70. 
 Since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, and the combined age is 100, we can set up the equation:

Peter + Paul + Jean = 100

We know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write Paul = Jean + 10

Since Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean, we can substitute Paul = Jean + 10 into the original equation:

Peter = Paul + Jean
Peter = (Jean + 10) + Jean
Peter = 2Jean + 10

Now we have:

2Jean + 10 + Jean + Jean = 100
3Jean + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3Jean = 90

Divide by 3:

Jean = 30

Now we know Jean's age, and Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so Paul's age is:

Paul = Jean + 10
= 30 + 10
= 40

Since Peter's age is the sum of Paul and Jean's age, we can find Peter's age:

Peter = Paul + Jean
= 40 + 30
= 70

The answer is 70.

 To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance each person spits and then find the average of those two distances. 

Zoey's watermelon has 40 seeds.  Each seed is spit 10 feet.  So, Zoey spits seeds for a total of 40 x 10 = 400 feet. 

Sydney's watermelon has 35 seeds.  Each seed is spit 12 feet.  So, Sydney spits seeds for a total of 35 x 12 = 420 feet. 

To find the average of the two, we add the two distances together and then divide by 2. 

400 + 420 = 820 feet

820 ÷ 2 = 410 feet

The average total distance spat is 410 feet.  The answer is 410.

So, the extra hours cost 5 * 70 = 350 pesos.  Total cost is 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos.  If Cameron paid for 24 hours, it would be 1600 pesos.  Savings is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.  The answer is 250 pesos. 
1.  Cameron stays for 17 hours (from 5 pm to 10 am next morning).  He pays for 12 hours first, which would cost 1000 pesos.  Then he pays for the additional 5 hours for 70 pesos each.  5 x 70 = 350 pesos.  So he pays 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos. 

2.  If he had chosen the 24-hour stay option, he would pay 1600 pesos. 

3.  The difference is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos. 

So Cameron saved 250 pesos.  The answer is 250.

[EXP] 538: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 159, [output]: 15 goats need 15 x 5 = 75 pounds of hay.  Each sheep needs 2 x 5 - 3 = 7 pounds of hay.  There are 12 sheep, so that is 12 x 7 = 84 pounds of hay.  In total, Nate needs 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.  The answer is 159. 
 First, we need to find out how many pounds each sheep needs.  Each goat needs 5 pounds.  Each sheep needs 3 pounds less than twice what a goat needs, so each sheep needs 2 * 5 - 3 = 7 pounds.  There are 15 goats and 12 sheep.  So the total amount of hay needed is 15 * 5 = 75 pounds for the goats, and 12 * 7 = 84 pounds for the sheep.  75 + 84 is 159.  The answer is 159. 
 First, let's figure out how much hay the sheep need.  A goat needs 5 pounds.  Twice the amount a goat needs is 2 x 5 = 10 pounds.  3 pounds less than that is 10 - 3 = 7 pounds.  Since there are 12 sheep, they need 12 x 7 = 84 pounds of hay. 

Next, let's figure out how much hay the goats need.  Since there are 15 goats and each goat needs 5 pounds of hay, they need 15 x 5 = 75 pounds of hay. 

Finally, let's add the amount of hay needed for the sheep and goats.  They need 84 + 75 = 159 pounds of hay.  The answer is 159. 
5 goats need 5 * 15 = 75 pounds of hay.  Let's find out how much hay is needed for sheep.  Each goat needs 5 pounds of hay.  For the sheep, we need 3 pounds less than twice the amount.  That is 2 x 5 - 3 = 7 pounds.  We have 12 sheep, so we need 7 x 12 = 84 pounds for the sheep.  The total amount of hay needed is 75 + 84 = 159 pounds.  The answer is 159.

Then he spent 50 dollars on gas and 5 * 10 = 50 dollars on pencils, so he has 300 - 50 - 50 = 200 dollars left.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 200 - 100 = 100 dollars left.  Pens cost 25 dollars each, so he can buy 100 / 25 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
 John earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars.  After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars, so he will have 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left. 

He bought 5 pencils that cost 10 dollars each, so the pencils cost 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  So he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left. 

With the remaining 100 dollars, he can buy 100 / 25 = 4 pens.  The answer is 4. 
1.  John earned 50 dollars per hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50 * 6 = 300 dollars. 

2.  He spent 50 dollars on gas, so he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars left. 

3.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 250 - 100 = 150 dollars left. 

4.  5 pencils for 10 dollars each will cost 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.  This leaves him with 150 - 50 = 100 dollars. 

5.  The question asks how many 25 dollar pens can he buy.  This means we need to divide 100 by 25, the cost of each pen: 100 ÷ 25 = 4. 

The answer is 4 pens.

[EXP] 543: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 205, [output]:  The job cost $40 to visit the house.  Labor was 2. 25 hours at $35 per hour, so labor was 2. 25 x 35 = 78. 75.  Parts cost $60.  Adding all together, 40 + 78. 75 + 60 = 178. 75.  The answer is 178. 75. 
40 for the visit, plus the labor which is 35 dollars per hour.  2. 25 hours is 2 hours and 15 minutes, or 2. 25 hours.  Multiply 2. 25 hours by 35 dollars per hour to get 2. 25 * 35 = 78. 75.  So labor was 78. 75 dollars.  Plus the 60 dollars for parts, the total is 40 + 78. 75 + 60 = 178. 75.  The answer is 178. 75. 
40 + (35 x 2. 25) + 60 = ?

First, start with the base charge: 40
For labor, you need to convert hours to a whole number then calculate the cost:
2. 25 hours = 2 hours and 15 minutes = 2 hours + 0. 25 hours
2 hours * 35 = 70, and then add the 0. 25 hours * 35 = 8. 75 (add 0. 25 hours for parts of an hour)
70 + 8. 75 = 78. 75
So, the total labor cost is 78. 75
The total cost is the base charge + labor cost + parts:
40 + 78. 75 + 60 = 178. 75
The answer is 178. 75. 
 We need to find the total charge.  First, the base charge is $40.  For the labor, 2. 25 hours is 2 hours and 15 minutes, so we can approximate it as 2. 25 hours.  35 dollars per hour, or part thereof.  2. 25 hours times 35 dollars per hour is 2. 25 x 35 = 78. 75.  Since we can't have 0. 75 of an hour, we take the total labor time up to the hour just before.  So we take 2 full hours of labor and add the remaining 0. 25 hour.  The total labor is 2 x 35 + 0. 25 * 35 = 70 + 8. 75 = 78. 75 dollars.  Add the base charge and the labor to get 40 + 78. 75 = 118. 75.  Finally, for the parts, the cost is 60 dollars.  The total charge is the base charge, labor, and parts.  118. 75 + 60 = 178. 75.  The answer is 178. 75.

[EXP] 544: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 40% off means that James gets the CDs for 40% less than the original price.   40% of 15 is 0. 4 * 15 = 6.   So each CD now costs 15 - 6 = 9 dollars.   James bought 10 CDs for 9 dollars each, so he spent 10 * 9 = 90 dollars.   He then sold 5 CDs for 40 dollars, which means he got 5 * 8 = 40 dollars.   Since he spent 90 and got 40, he was "out" 90 - 40 = 50 dollars.   The answer is 50. 
 James gets 10 CDs and they cost 15 dollars each.  With 40% off, each CD will cost 15 * (1 - 0. 4) = 9 dollars.  The total cost of 10 CDs will be 9 * 10 = 90 dollars.  He decides he doesn't like 5 CDs and sells them for 40 dollars.  So he earns 40 dollars from selling them.  However, he has spent 90 - 40 = 50 dollars so far.  He lost 50 dollars.  The answer is 50. 
 James gets 10 new CDs, each for 15 dollars, but with 40% off.  40% of 15 is 0. 4 x 15 = 6 dollars off.  So each CD costs 15 - 6 = 9 dollars.  James has 10 CDs, so he spent 10 x 9 = 90 dollars on the CDs. 

He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for 40 dollars.  5 CDs for 40 dollars is 8 dollars per CD.  So he gets 5 x 8 = 40 dollars from selling the CDs. 

James lost money because he spent 90 dollars to get the CDs and only got 40 dollars back from selling 5 of them.  So he was out 90 - 40 dollars.  90 - 40 is 50.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 546: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  James originally has to swim 20 miles.  He swims 60% of the way, which is 0. 6 * 20 = 12 miles.  The time it took him to swim these 12 miles is 12/2 = 6 hours.  He rests for half this time, which is 6/2 = 3 hours.  The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  He swims this at half his original speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  So this takes 8 hours.  In total, James spent 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
1.  James swims 20 miles.  To swim 60% of the distance, he swims 20 * 0. 6 = 12 miles.  12 miles at a pace of 2 miles per hour will take 12 / 2 = 6 hours.  He rests for half as long as the swimming time, which is 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  Then he finishes the remaining 8 miles (20 - 12 = 8) at half the speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  So it will take 8 hours to finish the rest.  6 hours of swimming + 3 hours of rest + 8 hours at the end = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
60% of 20 miles is 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles.  So James swam 12 miles.  The rest of the distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  

To swim 12 miles at 2 miles per hour, it will take James 6 hours.  

After finishing the 12 miles, he rested for half the time which is 3 hours.  

Then he swims the remaining 8 miles at half speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  It will take 8 hours to swim 8 miles at 1 mile per hour.  

In total, James swam for 6 hours, rested for 3 hours, and swam for 8 hours.  So, the total time it took him to get across the lake is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 James starts by swimming 60% of the distance, which means 60% of 20 = 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles.  It will take him 12/2 = 6 hours to swim those 12 miles.  On the island, he rests for half as long as the swimming time, so 6/2 = 3 hours.  

After resting, James still has to swim 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  At half his original pace, he will swim at 2/2 = 1 mile per hour.  It will take him 8 miles / 1 mile per hour = 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.  

In total, it took James 6 hours to swim 12 miles, plus 3 hours to rest, plus 8 hours to swim the remaining 8 miles.  That's 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.  The answer is 17. 
 Let's start by calculating how many miles James swam in the first part.  He swam 60% of the 20-mile lake.  To find 60% of 20, multiply 20 by 0. 6 = 12 miles. 

James swam for 12 miles at 2 miles per hour.  To find the time he took to swim 12 miles, divide 12 miles by 2 miles per hour = 6 hours. 

James then rests for half the time it took him to swim.  Half of 6 hours is 3 hours.  After his rest, he finishes the remaining distance, which is 20 - 12 = 8 miles, at half his speed, which is 1 mile per hour.  To find the time it took him to swim the remaining 8 miles, divide 8 miles by 1 mile per hour = 8 hours. 

James swam for 6 hours initially, rested for 3 hours, and then swam for 8 hours.  In total, he spent 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours to get across the lake.  The answer is 17.

[EXP] 549: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 10% commission on each copy of the New York Times means 0. 1 x $5 = $0. 5 commission per copy.  Commission per copy of the New York Times = 0. 5 dollars, and number of copies sold = 6, so total commission for New York Times = 0. 5 x 6 = 3 dollars.  8% commission on each copy of the Wall Street Journal means 0. 08 x $15 = $1. 20 commission per copy.  Commission per copy of the Wall Street Journal = 1. 20 dollars, and number of copies sold = 10, so total commission for Wall Street Journal = 1. 20 x 10 = 12 dollars.  Total commission = commission for New York Times + commission for Wall Street Journal = 3 + 12 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
 There are several steps to this problem.  Let's start by calculating the cost of the newspapers:

6 copies of the New York Times x $5 each = 6 x 5 = 30
10 copies of the Wall Street Journal x $15 each = 10 x 15 = 150

Now, let's calculate the total commission:

Commission on the New York Times: 10% of 30 = 0. 1 x 30 = 3
Commission on the Wall Street Journal: 8% of 150 = 0. 08 x 150 = 12

Now, let's add both commissions together to get the total commission:
3 + 12 = 15

The answer is 15.

 Since Deanna is 26, Marcus is 5 years younger, so he is 26 - 5 = 21.  Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, Leo is twice Marcus' age, so Leo's age is 2 x 21 = 42.  The answer is 42. 
 Let's start by using the information we have: Deanna is 26. 

Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, so Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21. 

Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is 2 times Marcus' age:

Leo's age = 2 x 21 = 42

The answer is 42. 
 Since Deanna is 26 years old, Marcus must be 26 - 5 = 21 years old, since he is 5 years younger than Deanna.  Since Marcus is half of Leo’s age, Leo must be 2 times 21 years old = 42 years old.  The answer is 42. 
 Since Deanna is 26, Deanna is the age we are looking for.  Deanna is 26.  Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna.  So Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21.  Marcus is half of Leo's age.  So Leo's age is 2 x 21 = 42.  The answer is 42. 
 According to the clues:

Marcus is half of Leo's age. 
 Deanna is 26. 
Marcus is 5 years younger than Deanna, so Marcus' age is 26 - 5 = 21. 
Marcus is half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is 2 times Marcus' age = 2 x 21 = 42.

[EXP] 551: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 45 points in total.  Bahati scored the most and it was 20 more than Azibo scored.  Let's say Azibo scored x points.  Then Bahati scored x + 20 points.  Since Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, Dinar scored x + 10 points.  

The total points were 45, so x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45.  

Combine like terms: 3x + 30 = 45.  Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15.  Divide by 3: x = 5. 

Azibo scored 5 points.  The answer is 5.

[EXP] 552: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 300, [output]: 100 pages are printed on one inch of paper.  If the book is 1. 5 inches thick, then there are 100 * 1. 5 = 150 pages.  The answer is 150. 
100 pages per inch means 100 pages stack up into 1 inch.  If the book is 1. 5 inches thick, then the pages will be 100 * 1. 5 = 150 pages.  The answer is 150. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

1.  Each paper is printed on both sides, so each paper counts as 2 pages. 
2.  Since the paper is 100 pages to the inch, and the book is 1. 5 inches thick, we know that the book has:
1. 5 inches x 100 pages/inch = 150 pages
3.  Since each paper counts as 2 pages, we need to divide the total number of pages by 2 to get the number of actual papers:
150 pages / 2 = 75 papers
4.  Therefore, the book has 75 actual papers, but since each paper counts as 2 pages, the total number of pages in the book is:
75 papers x 2 pages/paper = 150 pages

The answer is 150.

[EXP] 554: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 452, [output]:  Kim originally went to bed at 10 p. m.  and woke up at 6 a. m.  which is 8 hours.   8 * 60 = 480 minutes. 

However, she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.  So she woke up at 5:55 a. m.  instead of 6 a. m.   6 a. m.  - 5:55 a. m.  = 5 minutes earlier. 

She also sleepwalked from 2:15 a. m.  to 2:38 a. m.  which is 23 minutes. 

So the total sleep she got, not including the sleeping during her sleepwalking, is 480 - 5 - 23 minutes.  480 - 5 is 475 and 475 - 23 is 452.  The answer is 452.

[EXP] 555: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Jonathan has 2 dozen cups.  2 dozen is equal to 24 measuring cups.  Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups.  2/3 of 24 is 16.  So Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.  After giving 6 away, he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.  In total, he has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons.  The answer is 34. 
1 dozen is 12, so two dozen is 2 x 12 = 24.  Jonathan has 24 measuring cups.  If he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as cups, then he has 2/3 * 24 = 16.  After giving 6 away, he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons.  There were 24 cups, so Jonathan has a total of 24 + 10 = 34 utensils remaining.  The answer is 34. 
1 dozen is equal to 12.  Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, so that is 2 x 12 = 24 measuring cups.  Since he has 2/3 as many measuring spoons, he has (2/3) * 24 = 16 measuring spoons originally.  If he gives 6 to Pedro, he will have 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.  In total, he has 24 measuring cups and 10 measuring spoons.  The answer is 34. 
 Jonathan has 2 dozen measuring cups, which is 24 cups.  To find out how many spoons he has, we multiply the cups by 2/3.  24 x 2/3 = 16.  So Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.  He gives 6 spoons to Pedro as a gift, so he has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left. 

To find the total number of utensils Jonathan has, we add the number of cups and spoons: 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34 utensils.  The answer is 34.

[EXP] 556: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 1000 beds in total, with 1/5 occupied.  That means 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds occupied.  1000 - 200 = 800 beds unoccupied.  Then, 50 patients are admitted each day.  Over 2 weeks, that is 14 days.  50 * 14 = 700.  After 700 more patients arrive, the number of unoccupied beds is 800 - 700 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
1/5 of the hospital's 1000 beds are occupied, so 1/5 x 1000 = 200 beds are occupied.  There are 1000 - 200 = 800 unoccupied beds initially.  After 2 weeks, which is 14 days, 50 patients are admitted daily.  50 * 14 = 700 patients are admitted in 2 weeks.  The hospital now has 700 occupied beds.  The total number of unoccupied beds is 800 - 700 = 100 beds.  The answer is 100. 
1/5 of the 1000 beds means that the hospital has (1000 * 1) / 5 = 200 occupied beds.  So the hospital has 1000 - 200 = 800 unoccupied beds.  Each day, 50 patients are admitted.  After 2 weeks, that is 2 * 7 = 14 days.  So 14 days of patient admissions is 14 x 50 = 700.  The hospital is admitting 700 new patients.  Therefore, the hospital now has 800 - 700 = 100 unoccupied beds.  The answer is 100. 
1/5 occupied means that 20% of the hospital is occupied.  20% of 1000 is 20/100 x 1000 = 200 beds occupied.  The remaining 1000 - 200 = 800 beds are unoccupied. 

Then, each day, 50 new patients are admitted.  For 2 weeks, that is 2 x 7 = 14 days.  14 x 50 = 700 more patients who will occupy beds.  

So, the total occupied beds are now 200 + 700 = 900.  

The remaining unoccupied beds are 1000 - 900 = 100. 

So, the answer is 100. 
1/5 of 1000 beds is occupied.  So, 1000 x (1/5) = 200 beds are occupied.  1000 - 200 = 800 beds are unoccupied. 

For 2 weeks, there are 14 days.  Each day, 50 new patients are admitted.  So, in 14 days, 50 x 14 = 700 additional patients are admitted.  
So, the beds used increase by 700.  The hospital had 200 occupied beds initially.  After admitting 700 more patients, the total occupied beds are 200 + 700 = 900.  

To find the unoccupied beds after 2 weeks, we subtract the occupied beds from the total capacity:

1000 - 900 = 100

The answer is 100.

16 is the total number of emails Robyn sends a day.  7 are work emails.  That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 emails that are not work emails.  Two-thirds of the remainder are to family, which means (2/3)*9 = 6 emails are to family.  That leaves 9 - 6 = 3 emails that are not to family.  One-third of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend, which means (1/3)*3 = 1 email is to her boyfriend.  The answer is 1. 
16 emails are sent each day.  7 of them are work emails.  So 16 - 7 = 9 are left for non-work emails.  2/3 of these 9 are to family, so 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.  9 - 6 = 3 are left for other non-work emails.  1/3 of these are to her boyfriend.  1/3 * 3 = 1.  The answer is 1. 
 Robyn sends 16 emails a day. 

16 emails minus 7 work emails is 16 - 7 = 9 emails left. 

Two-thirds of the remainder (9) are to her family, which is 2/3 * 9 = 6. 

The remaining emails to her boyfriend are one-third of the other 3 emails.  1/3 * 3 = 1. 

The answer is 1. 
16 emails are sent by Robyn per day.  7 are work emails, so the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9.  2/3 of the remainder are to family, so 2/3 * 9 = 6 emails are to family.  This leaves 9 - 6 = 3 for the other category (boyfriend).  Now, one-third of these emails are to her boyfriend.  So, 1/3 * 3 = 1 email is to her boyfriend.  The answer is 1.

 Since Aliya is 3 years old, then Shawna is 3 x 3 = 9 years old.  Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so he is 9 x 5 = 45 years old.  The answer is 45. 
 Shawna's age is 3 times Aliya's age, which is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.  Since her father is 5 times her age, Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45 years old.  The answer is 45. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, we know Aliya is 3 years old.  Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 x 3 = 9 years old. 
Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so Shawna's father is 9 x 5 = 45 years old. 
The answer is 45. 
 Let's start from Aliya's age, which is 3. 

According to the problem, Shawna is three times as old as Aliya, so Shawna's age is 3 * 3 = 9. 

According to the problem, Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna, so Shawna's father's age is 5 * 9 = 45.

[EXP] 559: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Since Kelly said Courtney overstated the number of people in attendance by 20%, that means Courtney's number of people was 120% of the actual number.  So, if Courtney said 48 people attended, then 48 is actually 120% of the actual number. 

To find the actual number, we can use division:

48 ÷ 1. 2 = 40

So, Kelly says the actual number of people attending the concert was 40.  The answer is 40. 
48 is the reported number of people by Courtney.  Since Courtney overstated the number by 20%, we can set up an equation to solve for the correct number. 

Let x be the correct number of people attending the concert. 

The percentage increase is 20%, so we can convert it to a decimal by dividing by 100: 0. 20

The equation becomes:

48 = x + (0. 20)x

Combine like terms:

48 = 1. 20x

Now, divide both sides by 1. 20:

x = 48/1. 20
x = 40

The correct number of people who attended the concert is 40.  The answer is 40.

[EXP] 560: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  Since Jason carried 2 balls, and Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey, Jeffrey must have carried half as many as Jason.  2 / 2 = 1, so Jeffrey carried 1 ball.  Since Jordan carried twice as many as Jason, Jordan carried 2 * 2 = 4 balls.  

In total, the three boys picked up 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 balls.  But this is the number of balls they picked up after the coach dumped out all the balls on the floor.  So the total number of balls originally is 7 + the initial 1 bag.  The coach brought 1 bag, so add 1 to 7 and we get 8.  The answer is 8. 
 Jason picked up 2 balls.  Jordan picked up twice as many as Jason, so Jordan picked up 2 x 2 = 4 balls.  Jeffrey picked up half as many as Jason, so Jeffrey picked up 2 / 2 = 1 ball.  The total number of balls the three boys carried is 2 + 4 + 1 = 7 balls.  Since they carried all the balls in one trip, the total number of balls Coach brought to practice is 7 plus the number that the boys had already carried by the time they made the trip.  So 7 + 1 = 8 balls. 


The answer is 8. 
Note: The solution assumes that the coach brought at least one ball to practice.  If the coach brought zero balls, the solution would be different.

[EXP] 561: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  The pirates dug 10 holes the first day, 13 holes the second day, and 8 holes the third day before filling in 2 holes.  So by the end of the third day, they had dug a total of 10 + 13 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes. 

The island has 4 times as many holes by the end of the fourth day than it did at the end of the first day.  So by the end of the fourth day, it will have 4 * 10 = 40 holes. 

Since they started with 29 holes, they will have 40 - 29 = 11 more holes after finding the treasure.  The answer is 11. 
 The pirates dug 10 holes the first day.  The number of holes on the second day added to the first day is 10 + 13 = 23.  Then the number of holes on the second and third day added together and then minus the 2 holes filled is 23 + 8 - 2 = 29 holes on the third day.  The problem states the island had four times as many holes at the end of the fourth day as the first day.  The first day had 10 holes.  Four times 10 is 40.  So the island had 40 holes at the end of the fourth day.  Since the pirates started with 29 holes at the end of the third day, they dug 40 - 29 = 11 more holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.  The answer is 11. 
 Let's break this down step by step:

Day 1: 10 holes
Day 2: 13 additional holes, so now the total is 10 + 13 = 23 holes
Day 3: 8 additional holes, so now the total is 23 + 8 = 31 holes.  The pirates fill in 2 holes they kept falling into, so the total number of holes is 31 - 2 = 29. 
Day 4: The island has 4 times as many holes as it did at the end of Day 1.  The number of holes at the end of Day 1 was 10.  4 times 10 is 40.  So, the number of holes at the end of Day 4 should be 40. 

Currently, there are 29 holes.  The number of new holes dug on Day 4 is the difference between 40 (total number of holes) and 29 (existing number of holes).  40 - 29 = 11.  The answer is 11. 
 Let's count the number of holes the pirates dug up to and including the third day:

* 10 holes the first day
* 13 holes the second day (adds to 23)
* 8 holes the third day (adds to 31)
* Then, they filled in 2 holes, so the total holes dug up to the third day is 31 - 2 = 29

On the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day.  Since there were 10 holes the first day, the island should have 10 * 4 = 40 holes on the fourth day.  The pirates found the treasure chest full of gold on this day, so there were 40 - 29 = 11 holes left to dig. 

The answer is 11.

So the third person got 70 + 15 = 85 chips.  In total, they got 70 + 70 + 85 = 225 chips.  The answer is 225. 
 Amora and Lainey got 70 corn chips each, and Collins got 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips (15 more than 70).  So, to find the total number of corn chips, we add 70 + 70 + 85 = 225.  The answer is 225. 
70 corn chips are shared among 2 people, which means each person gets 70.  This leaves one person who gets 15 more than 70.  So, this person gets 70 + 15 = 85 corn chips.  The total amount of corn chips is the sum of the corn chips shared by the 2 people, and the remaining corn chips.  The sum of the corn chips shared by the 2 people is 2 * 70 = 140.  And, the remaining corn chips are 85.  So, the total amount of corn chips is 140 + 85 = 225 chips.  The answer is 225.

 Jen needs to pay $400 for the supplies.  If the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies, then the tickets cost 400 + 0. 5*400 = 400 + 200 = 600.  The answer is 600. 
 Jen needs to pay $400 for supplies.  The cost of the tickets is 50% more than the supplies.  50% of 400 is 400 x 0. 5 = 200, so the cost of the tickets is $400 + $200 = $600.  The answer is 600. 
 Jen needs $400 for supplies.  The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies, so that's 100% + 50% = 150% of 400 dollars, which is 1. 5 x 400 = 600 dollars.  The answer is 600. 
50% more means the cost is 150% of the cost of supplies.  So the cost for travel is (400 x 1. 5) = 600.  The answer is 600. 
 Jen has to pay 400 dollars for supplies.  The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies.  To find 50% of 400, you can multiply 400 by 0. 5 to get 200.  400 + 200 is 600.  So the cost of the tickets is 600.  The answer is 600. 
50% more than the supplies would be an additional 400 * 0. 50 = 200 dollars.  So in total, he spent 400 dollars on supplies and 200 dollars extra for the tickets, which means the travel cost is 400 + 200 = 600.  The answer is 600.

[EXP] 564: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 147, [output]:  Let's start by using some variables to represent the number of Pokémon caught by each person.  We can say that Adelwolfe caught a certain number, which we'll call x. 

Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, which means that Alex caught x + 5. 

Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, which means that Stan caught 4x - 13. 

The total number of Pokémon caught is 339, which is the sum of the number caught by each person.  We can write this as:

x + (x + 5) + (4x - 13) = 339

Simplifying this equation, we get:

6x - 8 = 339

Add 8 to both sides:

6x = 347

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 58

Since Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, Stan caught 4x - 13 = 4(58) - 13 = 232 - 13 = 219. 

The answer is 219.

Each episode is 20 minutes long, so to find the total number of minutes he will watch, we multiply the number of episodes by the minutes per episode: 10 x 20 = 200.  The answer is 200. 
 Since each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes as minutes per episode, the total number of episodes is 20/2 = 10 episodes. 

To find the total number of minutes John will spend watching the show, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
10 episodes x 20 minutes/episode = 200 minutes

The answer is 200 minutes. 
20 minutes is the time per episode.  Half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode means that the total number of episodes is 20 / 2 = 10.  So there are 10 episodes.  To find the total time, multiply the number of episodes by the time per episode, which is 10 x 20 = 200 minutes.  The answer is 200. 
 Each episode is 20 minutes long, so the total length of all episodes is 20 * ? minutes.  If there are half as many episodes as there are minutes in an episode, that means the total number of episodes is ? = 20 / 2 = 10.  The total length of all episodes is 20 * 10 = 200 minutes.  The answer is 200. 
 Let's first find the number of episodes.  There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode, so number of episodes = 20 / 2 = 10. 

Now, since there are 10 episodes, and each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of minutes he will spend watching the show is 20 x 10 = 200. 

The answer is 200 minutes. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

Each episode is 20 minutes long. 

There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. 

Let's call the number of episodes x.  Since each episode is 20 minutes long, the total number of minutes is 20x. 

We know that x is half of 20, so x = 20/2 = 10. 

The total number of minutes is 20x = 20 × 10 = 200. 

Since John watches every episode, he spends 200 minutes watching the show.  The answer is 200. 
 Let's figure out how many episodes there are.  Each episode is 20 minutes long.  There are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.  So, let's divide 20 minutes by 2 and we get 10 episodes. 

Now that we know there are 10 episodes, let's find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are 10 episodes.  To find the total minutes, we multiply the number of episodes (10) by the duration of each episode (20 minutes): 10 x 20 = 200 minutes. 

The answer is 200.

[EXP] 566: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 374, [output]:  The bird flew for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  This means she flew a total of 30 x 10 = 300 miles in the southern direction.  Then, she flew for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.  So she flew 18 x 2 = 36 miles in the northern direction.  Then, she flew for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.  She flew a total of 22 x 5 = 110 miles in the southern direction.  The distance between the two homes is the sum of the distances she flew in the southern direction minus the distance she flew in the northern direction.  So, the distance is 300 + 110 - 36 = 374 miles.  The answer is 374. 
 Let's break this problem down into smaller parts. 

First, the bird is flying in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  The distance it traveled south is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 10 hours = 300 miles

Next, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.  The distance it traveled north is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 18 mph x 2 hours = 36 miles

This means the bird is now at a location that is 300 - 36 = 264 miles farther south than its original home. 

Finally, the bird changes direction and flies towards the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.  The distance it traveled south is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 22 mph x 5 hours = 110 miles

So, the total distance the bird traveled is the sum of the distances: 264 + 110 = 374 miles. 

The answer is 374. 
 To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance the bird traveled in three segments. 

First, the bird traveled for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.   This means she covered a distance of 10 x 30 = 300 miles in this direction. 

Next, the bird flew in the opposite direction for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.   This means she traveled a distance of 2 x 18 = 36 miles in this direction. 

Finally, the bird traveled for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.   This means she covered a distance of 5 x 22 = 110 miles. 

To find the total distance traveled, we need to add these three distances together.  300 - 36 + 110 = 374. 

The answer is 374. 
 We will add up the distance the bird traveled.  The bird flew 10 hours at 30 mph.  That means she flew 10 x 30 = 300 miles.  Then she flew north at 18 mph for 2 hours.  That means she flew 2 x 18 = 36 miles north.  So, she was actually 300 - 36 = 264 miles away from her southern home.  Then she flew 5 hours at 22 mph towards the south.  That means she flew 5 x 22 = 110 miles.  So she landed exactly at her southern home, meaning the distance between her northern and southern homes is 264 + 110 = 374.  The answer is 374. 
 First, the bird flies 10 hours at 30 miles per hour, which is 10 x 30 = 300 miles.  Then, the bird flies 2 hours north at 18 miles per hour, which is 2 * 18 = 36 miles.  So, she moved 36 miles away from her southern home.  Then, the bird flies 5 hours south at 22 miles per hour, which is 5 * 22 = 110 miles.  That's a total of 110 miles in the right direction.  We add this to the distance she subtracted when flying north, so 300 + (110 - 36) = 374.  The answer is 374.

[EXP] 567: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Greta originally made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 12 brownies.  She got 1/2 a dozen more brownies at her office party, which is half of 12, so 6 brownies.  Then, she got 4 dozen brownies at home, which is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies.  In total, Greta had 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 brownies.  During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.  So Greta has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48. 
12 brownies were from her own batch, and 1/2 dozen from her office, which is 6 brownies.  So 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.  Her friends at home had 4 dozen, which is 48 brownies.  So in total she had 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.  1 1/2 dozen, or 18 brownies, were eaten.  66 - 18 = 48.  The answer is 48. 
1 dozen = 12, so the batch Greta made for herself had 12 brownies.  1/2 dozen is 6, so she got 6 more.  So she had 12 + 6 = 18 brownies total.  Then her friends brought 4 dozen, which is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies.  So she now has 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.  After eating 1 1/2 dozen, she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48. 
 Greta starts with 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.  She receives 1/2 dozen more brownies from her office.  So she now has 1 + (1/2) = 1 1/2 dozen.  Then, she receives 4 dozen brownies from her friends.  In total, she has now 1 1/2 + 4 = 5 1/2 dozen = 66 brownies.  1 1/2 dozen brownies are eaten.  1 1/2 dozen is equal to 18 brownies.  Now Greta has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48. 
 Greta started with a batch of 1 dozen brownies for herself.  That is 12 brownies.  Her office also sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies.  1/2 a dozen is 6 brownies.  So she has 12 + 6 = 18 brownies so far.  

At home, she got 4 dozen brownies.  4 dozen is 4 x 12 = 48 brownies.  In total, she now has 18 + 48 = 66 brownies. 

But 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.  1 1/2 is 1. 5, and 1. 5 dozen is 1. 5 x 12 = 18 brownies.  So 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48.

[EXP] 568: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Nani is 8 years old.  His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16 years old.  Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, so she is 8 - (8 * 0. 25) = 8 - 2 = 6 years old.  In total, Nani, his brother, and his sister are 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years old.  The answer is 30. 
 Nani is 8 years old.  His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 2 * 8 = 16. 

The sister is 25% younger than Nani, which means she is 8 - 2 = 6 years old. 

To get the total age, we add all three:
8 + 16 + 6 = 30

The answer is 30. 
 First, Nani's brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 * 2 = 16.  Knowing this, we can find Nani's sister's age by subtracting 25% of Nani's age from Nani's age.  25% of Nani's age is 0. 25 * 8 = 2.  So Nani's sister's age is 8 - 2 = 6.  In total, the family's age is 8 + 16 + 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Let's start by figuring out the age of Nani's brother.  Nani is 8 years old, so his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old. 

Next, let's figure out the age of his sister.  We know that Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, which means she is 0. 75 times his age.  8 * 0. 75 = 6, so Nani's sister is 6 years old. 

Now that we know all their ages, we can add them up to find the total age.  8 + 16 + 6 = 30.  The answer is 30.

To find the total time it will take, add all of these together: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.  The answer is 227. 
12 racquets need to be restrung, separated into 3 synthetic gut, 5 polyester string, and 4 hybrid sets. 
	* 3 synthetic gut racquets will take 3 * 15 = 45 minutes. 
	* 5 polyester string racquets will take 5 * 22 = 110 minutes. 
	* 4 hybrid sets will take 4 * 18 = 72 minutes. 
	Total time is 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes. 
	The answer is 227 minutes. 
12 racquets need to be restringed.  3 will be strung with synthetic gut.  So, it would take 3 x 15 = 45 minutes.  5 will be strung with polyester.  So, it would take 5 x 22 = 110.  4 will be strung with hybrid sets.  So, it would take 4 x 18 = 72.  To find the total time it will take, we add these numbers: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes.  The answer is 227. 
 To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller parts.   Let's calculate the time it takes Andy to string each type of racquet:

Synthetic gut:  3 racquets * 15 minutes/racquet = 45 minutes
Polyester string:  5 racquets * 22 minutes/racquet = 110 minutes
Hybrid string:  4 racquets * 18 minutes/racquet = 72 minutes

Now, we add up the total time: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

The answer is 227.

 John started with buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which is a total of 4 phones.  The first 2 phones cost $600 each, so those are 2 x 600 = 1200 dollars.  The remaining 2 phones cost half price, so that's 2 x (600 / 2) = 2 x 300 = 600 dollars.  So the total he paid is 1200 + 600 = 1800 dollars.  The answer is 1800.

 There are originally 13 players in Carlton's team.  Zeke's team has 7 more players.  13 + 7 = 20.  Then we need to combine both teams.  We add 20 to 13.  20 + 13 = 33.  The answer is 33.

[EXP] 572: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Robert wants to build a fence that is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide.  The total perimeter of the fence is 15*2 + 10*2 = 30 + 20 = 50 feet.  He needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, so he needs 50*2 = 100 wooden slats.  The answer is 100. 
 The fence is 15 feet long and 10 feet wide, so it has a total perimeter of 15 x 2 + 10 x 2 = 30 + 20 = 50 feet.   Every foot needs 2 slats, so he needs 50 x 2 = 100 slats.   The answer is 100. 
 To find the perimeter of the fence, we need to find the total length of the fencing around the garden.  The perimeter is 2 * (length + width).  2 * (15 + 10) = 2 * 25 = 50 feet.  So the fence is 50 feet long.  Robert needs 2 slats per foot, so he will need 2 * 50 slats.  2 * 50 is 100.  The answer is 100. 
 Robert needs wood slats for a 15 foot long and a 10 foot wide rectangular fence.   That means the length of the fence will be 2*15 = 30 feet and the width of the fence will be 2*10 = 20 feet.   So the total number of wood slats will be 30 + 20 + 30 + 20 = 100 feet.   Then we divide the 100 feet by 1 foot slats.   100 / 1 = 100.   The answer is 100.

She kept 1/4 of these 8 boxes.  8 divided by 4 is 2.  So she kept 2 boxes.  She had 8 - 2 = 6 boxes left.  Each box contains 20 oranges.  6 * 20 is 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Mrs.  Harrington started with 12 boxes of oranges.  Each box contains 20 oranges, so in total she had 12 x 20 = 240 oranges.  She gave 2 boxes (40 oranges) to her mom and 2 boxes (40 oranges) to her sister, so 40 + 40 = 80 oranges were given away.  That leaves 240 - 80 = 160 oranges.  Then she kept 1/4 of the remaining oranges and sold the rest.  1/4 of 160 is 40 oranges.  So Mrs.  Harrington kept 40 and sold the rest, which is 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.  The answer is 120.

 There are 50 states in the USA.  Half of that is 50 / 2 = 25.  India has 4 more than that, so they have 25 + 4 = 29 states.  In total, there are 50 + 29 = 79 states in both countries together.  The answer is 79. 
 The US has 50 states.  Half of 50 is 25.  4 more than 25 is 29.  Since India has 29 states, the total number of states in both countries is 50 + 29 = 79.  The answer is 79. 
1st step: Let's find out the number of states in the USA.  There are 50 states in the USA.  2nd step: India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA.  So, half the number of states in the USA is 50/2 = 25.  4 more than that is 25 + 4 = 29.  3rd step: Now, let's add the number of states in the USA and India together.  50 + 29 = 79.  The answer is 79. 
 One way to solve this problem is to find the total number of states in the USA and then add 4.  Then, you would add the total number of states in India to this result.  However, that is a long way around. 

An easier way is to simply find what America has.  The USA has 50 states.  50 / 2 = 25.  25 + 4 = 29.  Now we add the number of states in India to 29.  This is not necessary, however.  The question asks for the total number of states in both countries.  So, 29 + the number of states in India is enough. 

The question asks you to subtract the number of states in the USA from the sum 29 to get the number of states in India.  You would subtract 50 from 29 to get 29 - 50 = -21.  However, you cannot have a negative number of states.  So, we are going to assume that the question was made up incorrectly and we're going to count the total number of states backward from 50. 

50 - 1 = 49.  49 - 2 = 47.  47 - 3 = 44.  44 - 4 = 40.  40 - 5 = 35.  35 - 6 = 29.  That was the given number of states in India!

The total number of states in the USA and India together is 50 + 29 = 79.  The answer is 79.

The answer is 20. 
 Let's start by finding out how many cherries Richard has.  Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, so Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.  Since there are 60 cherries in total and 30 + 20 cherries with Robert and Richard, Jerry must have the remaining ones.  60 - 30 - 20 = 10.  Jerry has 10 cherries. 

Now, we want to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry.  Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries.  30 - 10 is 20.  Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry. 

The answer is 20. 
Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard.  So Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.  Jerry does not have a certain amount yet, but we know that Richard and Robert together have 30 + 20 = 50 cherries.  Since there are 60 cherries, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.  Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so he has 10 - 30 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.  The answer is 20. 
3 friends are sharing 60 cherries.  We know Robert has 30 cherries.  Since he has 10 more than Richard, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.  They have a total of 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, and 60 - 50 = 10 more cherries left.  Jerry must have those 10 cherries.  Now, we know Robert has 30 and Jerry has 10.

[EXP] 577: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 540, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.  On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so on Sunday he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. 

On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.  On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie, so on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie. 

For Saturday:

* Gingerbread: 10 boxes @ $6 per box = 10 x 6 = 60 dollars
* Apple pie: 11 boxes @ $15 per box = 11 x 15 = 165 dollars
* Total: 60 + 165 = 225 dollars

For Sunday:

* Gingerbread: 15 boxes @ $6 per box = 15 x 6 = 90 dollars
* Apple pie: 15 boxes @ $15 per box = 15 x 15 = 225 dollars
* Total: 90 + 225 = 315 dollars

Total earnings for two days: 225 + 315 = 540 dollars

The answer is 540. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, let's find out how many boxes of apple pie Sunny sold on Saturday.  He sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie on Saturday than on Sunday, and on Sunday he sold 15 boxes.  So on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie. 

Now, let's find out how many boxes of gingerbread Sunny sold on Saturday.  He sold 5 fewer boxes of gingerbread on Saturday than on Sunday, and on Saturday he sold 10 boxes.  So on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. 

Now that we know how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on each day, we can calculate his total earnings for two days.  On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 11 boxes of apple pie.  That will be (10 x $6) + (11 x $15) = $60 + $165 = $225.  On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread and 15 boxes of apple pie.  That will be (15 x $6) + (15 x $15) = $90 + $225 = $315. 

So Sunny earned $225 on Saturday and $315 on Sunday, for a total of $225 + $315 = $540.  The answer is 540.

She will be outside 4 hours a day for 8 days, so in total she will use 4 * 8 = 32 ounces of sunscreen.  If each bottle is 8 ounces, then she will need 32 ÷ 8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen.  The answer is 4. 
 Since Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, in 4 hours a day, she will use 4 ounces of sunscreen.  Since she will be doing this for 8 days, she will use 4 ounces/day * 8 days = 32 ounces.  Since sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, she will need 32 / 8 bottles = 4 bottles.  The answer is 4. 
 Pamela will be outside for 4 hours a day, and she re-applies sunscreen every hour.  So, she will re-apply 4 times a day.  Over 8 days, that is 4 x 8 = 32 applications.  Each application is 1 ounce, so in total, she will need 32 ounces.  Since sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, she will need 32 / 8 = 4 bottles.  The answer is 4. 
8-ounce bottles.  She reapplies an ounce every hour.  For each day, she will need to apply 4 ounces of sunscreen since there are 4 hours in a day.  4 ounces per day for 8 days would be 4 * 8 = 32 ounces.  Since there are 8-ounce bottles, she will need 32 / 8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen.  The answer is 4. 
 Pamala uses 1 ounce per hour, and she will be outside for 4 hours a day for 8 days.  4 * 8 = 32 hours.  Since 1 ounce per hour for 32 hours is 32 ounces, and her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, she will need to divide 32 by 8 to get the number of bottles.  32 / 8 is 4.  The answer is 4. 
 Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour, which means over 4 hours per day she reapplies sunscreen 4 times.  For 8 days, she reapplies sunscreen a total of 4 * 8 = 32 times.  Each time she reapplies sunscreen, she uses 1 ounce.  So, in total, Pamela needs to use 32 ounces of sunscreen.  Since the sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, she will need to pack at least 32 / 8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen.  The answer is 4.

100 is the price of the blue car.  The price of the red car is 40% cheaper.  To find 40% of 100, you can do 100 * 0. 4 = 40.  So the price of the red car is 100 - 40 = 60.  The blue car costs 100 and the red car costs 60.  The answer is 160. 
 Let's find the price of the red car first.  It's 40% cheaper than the blue car, which means it's 100% - 40% = 60% as expensive as the blue car.  60% of 100 is 0. 6 * 100 = 60. 

The price of the blue car is $100.  So the price of the red car is 60.  Now we can find the price of both cars together.  The blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60.  So in total, they cost 100 + 60 = 160.  The answer is 160.

 First, let's find the current age of Emil's brother.   Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he is 24, his brother will be half of 24 years old when Emil turns 24.  Half of 24 is 12.  So his brother is currently 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

So, when Emil turns 24, his dad will be 24 * 2 = 48 years old.  Since Emil is currently 19 years old, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old. 

The sum of the ages of his dad and his brother is 43 + 7 = 50.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 582: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Joe caught 3 pounds on Thursday.  On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.  On Saturday, he caught half of that, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.  In total, he caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.  Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, 21 pounds is 21 / 3 = 7 servings.  The answer is 7. 
 Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.  Then he caught 4 times that amount on Friday, which is 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.  On Saturday, he caught half the amount of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.  So, in total, he caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.  If 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, then he has 21 / 3 = 7 servings.  The answer is 7. 
 Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.   On Friday he caught 4 times that amount, which is 4 * 3 = 12.   On Saturday, he caught half of his Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6.   In total, he caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.   Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, the number of servings is 21 / 3 = 7.  The answer is 7. 
 Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.  He caught 4 times that on Friday, which is 3 x 4 = 12 pounds.  On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday, which is 12 ÷ 2 = 6 pounds.  3 pounds (from Thursday) + 12 pounds (from Friday) + 6 pounds (from Saturday) is 21 pounds.  There are 3 pounds per serving, so he has 21 ÷ 3 = 7 servings of crawfish.  The answer is 7.

[EXP] 583: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 20% of 30 students are football players.  This is 0. 20 x 30 = 6 students. 

Remaining students are 30 - 6 = 24 students. 

25% of 24 students are cheerleaders or part of band.  This is 0. 25 x 24 = 6 students. 

Total students leaving are the football players and the cheerleaders/band members, which is 6 + 6 = 12 students. 

The answer is 12. 
20% of the class are football players.  So, 0. 2 * 30 = 6 students are football players.  

Now, let's find the number of remaining students.  30 - 6 = 24 students.  

Out of the remaining 24 students, 25% are cheerleaders or part of band.  So, 0. 25 * 24 = 6 students are cheerleaders or part of band.  

In total, the number of students leaving early are 6 football players + 6 cheerleaders or band members = 12 students.  

The answer is 12. 
20% of the students are football players, and since 20% is 1/5, 1/5 of the students are football players.  So that is 30 * 1/5 = 6.  The remaining class has 30 - 6 = 24 students.  25% of the class are cheerleaders or part of band, which is 1/4.  The remaining class is 24, so 1/4 of 24 is 24 * 1/4 = 6.  6 football players and 6 cheerleaders or band members will leave early, for a total of 6 + 6 = 12.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 585: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 342, [output]:  Pat's flower bed is 111 feet long.  Since she needs to leave 1. 5 feet between every plant, let's convert 1. 5 feet to inches.  1. 5 feet * 12 inches/foot = 18 inches.  So between every plant, there will be 18 inches of space. 

Since 17 flowers are already owned, she still needs more.  To find the total number of flowers she needs, divide the bed length by the sum of the width of a flower (12 inches) and the space between plants (18 inches).  

Length of bed = 111 feet * 12 inches/foot = 1332 inches
Width of flower + space between = 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches
Number of plants = 1332 inches / 30 inches = 44. 4 (round down, since you can't have a fraction of a plant)

She needs 44 plants, and already has 17, so she needs 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.  Each plant costs $6, so she will spend 27 * 6 = 162 dollars.  The answer is 162.

[EXP] 586: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 63, [output]: 1 week is 7 days.  Edgar eats 18 pretzels per day, so he eats 18 * 7 = 126 pretzels in a week.  His brother eats 1/2 as many as Edgar, so he eats 1/2 * 126 = 63 pretzels in a week.  The answer is 63. 
18 pretzels a day is equal to 18 x 7 = 126 pretzels in a week for Edgar.  His brother eats 1/2 as many.  1/2 of 126 is 63.  The answer is 63. 
1/2 as many means that for every 2 pretzels Edgar eats, his brother eats 1.  So his brother eats 9 pretzels a day.  For a week, he eats 9 * 7 = 63 pretzels.  The answer is 63. 
 Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.  His brother eats 1/2 as many, which means his brother eats 1/2 x 18 = 9 pretzels a day.  Since he eats for 7 days a week, his brother ate 9 pretzels x 7 days = 63 pretzels.  The answer is 63. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

First, we find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a day.  Since Edgar eats 18 pretzels and his brother eats 1/2 as many, his brother eats 1/2 x 18 = 9 pretzels per day. 

Next, we find out how many pretzels his brother eats in a week.  A week has 7 days, so we multiply the number of pretzels he eats in a day by 7:

9 pretzels/day x 7 days = 63 pretzels

The answer is 63 pretzels.

Petunias cost $3 each, so she will spend 15 x 3 = 45 dollars on petunias.  She also wants to put 2 sweet potato vines in each basket, so she needs 2 x 5 = 10 sweet potato vines, which will cost 10 x 2. 50 = 25 dollars.  In total, she will spend 45 + 25 = 70 dollars.  The answer is 70. 
 In each basket, Katherine will add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.  So in total, 3 petunias x 5 baskets = 15 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines x 5 baskets = 10 sweet potato vines.  The petunias cost 3 dollars apiece, so 15 petunias will cost 15 x 3 = 45 dollars.  The sweet potato vines cost 2. 50 dollars apiece, so 10 sweet potato vines will cost 10 x 2. 50 = 25 dollars.  The total cost will be 45 + 25 = 70 dollars.  The answer is 70. 
 Katherine will add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines per basket.  Since there are 5 baskets, that is 3 x 5 = 15 petunias and 2 x 5 = 10 sweet potato vines.  Petunias cost $3 each, so that's 15 x 3 = 45 dollars.  Sweet potato vines cost $2. 50 each, so that's 10 x 2. 5 = 25 dollars.  In total, Katherine will spend 45 + 25 = 70 dollars filling all 5 hanging baskets.  The answer is 70. 
 Katherine started filling 5 hanging baskets.  Each basket has 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.  The cost of petunias is $3. 00 and sweet potato vines are $2. 50.

Roses need 1 pound each, so 3 pounds of soil can plant 3 roses.  The answer is 3. 
30 pounds of soil is available.  4 sunflowers each needing 3 pounds is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.  10 carnations each needing 1. 5 pounds is 10 * 1. 5 = 15 pounds.  In total they use 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.  They have 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.  Since roses need 1 pound each, they can plant 3 roses.  The answer is 3. 
30 pounds of soil are available.  4 sunflowers need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.  10 carnations need 10 x 1. 5 = 15 pounds.  We need to subtract these amounts to see how much soil is left over: 30 - 12 - 15 = 3.  Since each rose needs 1 pound, the maximum number of roses they can plant is 3 pounds.  The answer is 3. 
30 pounds of soil are available.  The sunflowers need 3 pounds each, and there are 4 sunflowers.  That's 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.  The carnations need 1. 5 pounds each, and there are 10 carnations.  That's 1. 5 x 10 = 15 pounds.  So far, they have used 12 + 15 = 27 pounds of soil.  That leaves 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil.  Roses need 1 pound each, so we can plant 3 of them.  The answer is 3. 
30-pound bag of soil is available.  Each rose needs 1 pound.  Each carnation needs 1. 5 pounds.  Each sunflower needs 3 pounds. 

For the 10 carnations, that will take 10 * 1. 5 = 15 pounds. 

For the 4 sunflowers, that will take 4 * 3 = 12 pounds. 

So far, that's 15 + 12 = 27 pounds used. 

30 - 27 = 3 pounds left

Each rose needs 1 pound, and we have 3 pounds left.  So we can plant 3 roses. 

The answer is 3. 
30 pounds of soil will be used for planting the flowers.  From the sunflowers alone, they will need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.  From the carnations, they will need 10 x 1. 5 = 15 pounds.  In total, they will need 12 + 15 = 27 pounds.  So there will be 30 - 27 = 3 pounds of soil left.  This is enough for 3 roses.  The answer is 3.

 Jessica makes $2,000 a month.  25% of that is 0. 25 x 2,000 = 500.  She sets aside 500 dollars a month.  In a year there are 12 months, so she will set aside 12 x 500 = 6,000 dollars.  Each pair of shoes costs 1000 dollars, so she can buy 6,000 / 1000 = 6 pairs of shoes in a year.  The answer is 6. 
 Jessica gets $2,000 every month.  In a year, she will get 12 * 2,000 = 24,000.  She sets 25% aside, which is 0. 25 * 24,000 = 6,000.  Each pair of shoes costs 1000 dollars.  6,000 / 1000 is 6.  The answer is 6 shoes. 
 Jessica makes $2,000. 00 a month.   Since she makes 12 months a year, that is 12 * 2,000 = 24,000 in a year.   She sets aside 25% of her paycheck.  To calculate 25% of 24,000, you can multiply 24,000 by 0. 25, which is 6,000.  This means that she saves 6,000 per year for shoes.  Each shoe costs $1,000, so to find out how many shoes she can buy, we divide 6,000 by 1,000, which is 6.  The answer is 6. 
 Jessica makes 2,000 a month.  She sets aside 25% of her paycheck.

She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 3 shrimp per minute.  To sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 3 = 30 minutes. 

In total, it will take her 15 + 30 = 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.  The answer is 45. 
 Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute.  So, it will take her 90/6 = 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp. 

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.  So, to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take her 90/30 * 10 = 30 minutes. 

Total time to peel and cook 90 shrimp = 15 minutes + 30 minutes = 45 minutes.  The answer is 45 minutes. 
 Let's break this down step by step!

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take her:

90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes to peel

She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes, which means she can sauté 90 shrimp in:

90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 3 sautés

Each sauté takes 10 minutes, so the total time it will take to sauté 90 shrimp is:

3 sautés x 10 minutes per sauté = 30 minutes

To peel and cook 90 shrimp, it will take Emily:

15 minutes to peel + 30 minutes to sauté = 45 minutes

So the answer is 45 minutes!. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute, so to peel 90 shrimp, it will take 90/6 = 15 minutes. 

After peeling the shrimp, she needs to sauté them.  It takes 10 minutes to sauté 30 shrimp, so to sauté 90 shrimp, it will take 30/30 * 3 = 3(10) = 30 minutes. 

Adding the time it takes to peel and sauté the shrimp, it will take Emily 15 minutes to peel and 30 minutes to sauté, for a total of 15 + 30 = 45 minutes.  The answer is 45 minutes.

[EXP] 591: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 







First, the air conditioner ran on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 2 degrees/hour * 3 hours = 6 degrees.  Then, it ran on high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 3 degrees/hour * 4 hours = 12 degrees.  So the room cooled by 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.  But then it was turned off for 2 hours, and the room warmed up 2 degrees/hour * 2 hours = 4 degrees.  So it's final temperature is 18 - 4 = 14 degrees lower than the starting temperature.  The answer is 14. 
 Let's start with the starting temperature.  If the room will warm up by 2 degrees per hour with no air conditioner running, then the room will warm up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees after 2 hours.  After 4 hours, it would warm up another 2 * 2 = 4 degrees, for a total of 4 + 4 = 8 degrees. 

Now, let's look at the air conditioner.  It was running on low for 3 hours, so it cooled the room 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.  Then it was turned up to high for 4 hours, so it cooled the room 3 * 4 = 12 degrees more.  So, in total, the air conditioner cooled the room 6 + 12 = 18 degrees. 

However, since the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, the room warmed up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.  So, the net result is the room cooled by 18 - 4 = 14 degrees. 

The answer is 14. 
 The room will warm up 2 degrees an hour without the air conditioner, so 2 x 2 = 4 degrees.  

When the air conditioner ran on low, it cooled the room 2 degrees per hour.  For 3 hours, that is 2 x 3 = 6 degrees.  

When it was turned up to high, it cooled 3 degrees per hour.  For 4 hours, that is 3 x 4 = 12 degrees.  

In total, the room cooled 6 + 12 = 18 degrees.  

The air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours, and the room will warm up 2 degrees an hour.  So, it will warm up 2 x 2 = 4 degrees during this time. 

After 18 degrees cooling, the room would warm up 4 degrees to become 14 degrees cooler than the starting temperature.  The answer is 14.

 Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.  Bill saw the comet a second time when he was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.  So Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 75 years before the second visit, when he was 90 years old.  90 - 75 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.  Bill saw the Comet for the second time when he was three times his father's age, which is 3 x 30 = 90 years old.  Since Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was 90, the first time he saw it was 75 years earlier.  90 - 75 is 15.  Since Bill was 15 years old the first time he saw the Comet, the answer is 15. 
 Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.  Bill saw the comet at three times that age.  So Bill was 30 x 3 = 90 years old when he saw the comet the second time.  To figure out how old Bill was when he saw it the first time, we have to travel back 75 years.  90 - 75 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
75 years was the time it took comet halley to orbit the sun.  We know that the comet was seen by Bill's dad when he was 30.  And seen by Bill when he was 3 times the age of his father when he saw the comet.  That means 3 * 30 = 90.  So Bill saw the comet when he was 90 years old.  To find the answer, we need to subtract 75 from 90.  90 - 75 = 15.

[EXP] 594: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Let's break down the problem:

* The first plane makes a total of trips each day.  
* It goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights.  That's 3/4ths or 0. 75 of its flights. 
* The remaining flights are split between France and Germany, which means 0. 25 or 1/4th of the flights are for each of these destinations. 
* The second plane flies only to Poland and makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes.  So the first plane makes 2 x 44 = 88 trips. 
* Now, let's find the number of flights to Greece: 0. 75 x 88 = 66 flights. 
* The remaining flights are 88 - 66 = 22 flights, which are split equally between France and Germany.  Half of these flights are to France, so the answer is 22 / 2 = 11. 

The first plane takes 11 flights to France. 
 Since each day, the first plane goes to Greece for three-quarters of its flights, that's 3/4 of its flights.  We don't know the total number of flights of the first plane, but we can find it out soon.  The remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany.  The first plane's total trips minus the trips to Greece are its trips not to Greece.  Since these trips are divided equally between two countries, the remaining trips are half for each country.  Since the other plane only goes to Poland and has 44 trips, these trips cannot count towards the trips to France and Germany. 

So, we can let the total trips of the first plane be x.  Then, 3/4x are trips to Greece.  The remaining trips are x - 3/4x.  Since these remaining trips are split between France and Germany, the trips to France are (1/2)(x - 3/4x) = 1/4x. 

We know 44 trips of the second plane are half the number of trips the first plane makes throughout each day.  Since we don't know the total trips of the first plane, let's call the total trips of the first plane 'x'.  Then, 44 = x/2, so x = 88. 

Now we know x, the total trips of the first plane, is 88.  We can find the trips to France: 1/4(88) = 22. 

The answer is 22.

There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 120 seconds is 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote howls for 20 x 2 = 40 seconds, and Igneous howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  In total, the three wolves howl for 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, 120 seconds is 120/60 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 Since Tobias howls for 20 seconds, Chikote howls for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds since Chikote howls twice as long as Tobias.  Igneous howls for the total of the other two wolves, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  So the total combined length of the three wolves' howls is 20 + 40 + 60 seconds.  20 + 40 + 60 = 120.  There are 60 seconds in 1 minute.  120/60 = 2.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
 Let's start by determining how long Chikote and Igneous howl.  If Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, and Tobias howls for 20 seconds, then Chikote howls for 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.  Since Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, that means he howls for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds, since Tobias and Chikote howl for a total of 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  

So, the total length of the three wolves' howls is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.  To convert this to minutes, we divide by 60, since there are 60 seconds in a minute.  120 / 60 = 2.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
 When Tobias howls, his howl lasts for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so Chikote's howl lasts for 2 * 20 = 40 seconds.  The total time of Tobias and Chikote's howls is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.  Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined.  The time for the other two wolves combined is 60 seconds.  So Igneous howls for 60 seconds.  In total, they howl for 60 + 60 seconds.  There are 60 seconds in a minute.  So we need to divide 120 (60 + 60) by 60 to get the time in minutes.  120 / 60 = 2.  The answer is 2 minutes.

[EXP] 597: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  Akbar is 3 years old, and Alessandro is 4 years old.  So, we can find the average age of the group without Helene: (3 + 4) / 2 = 3. 5. 
2.  Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene's age is 2 x 3. 5 = 7. 
3.  The total age of all four children is 20.  We know the age of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene, so we can subtract their ages from 20 to find Wilfred's age: 20 - (3 + 4 + 7) = 20 - 14 = 6. 
4.  The answer is 6. 
 Helene is twice the average age of the group, so the average age of the group is half of Helene's age.  Since Akbar and Alessandro's ages are known, we can total their ages and find the average age of the group.  The average age of Akbar and Alessandro is (3 + 4) / 2 = 3. 5.  Helene's age is double this, so Helene's age is 2 * 3. 5 = 7. 

Now we have the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene.  We can find the total age of all four children.  Akbar is 3 years old, Alessandro is 4 years old, Helene is 7 years old, and Wilfred's age is unknown.  We know the total age is 20.  So, we can set up an equation using the ages of all four children: 3 + 4 + 7 + Wilfred's age = 20

Subtracting 14 from each side, we get:
Wilfred's age = 20 - 14
Wilfred's age = 6

The answer is 6.

The answer is 50. 
100 guests brought 15 cookies each, for a total of 100 x 15 = 1500 cookies.  The bride gave 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door.  So the church got 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.  Since each person got 15 cookies, we can divide the number of cookies by 15 to find the number of people: 750 ÷ 15 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
100 guests were at the wedding.  Each guest brought 15 cookies, so there were 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies in total.  The bride gave half of the cookies to the church, so the church got 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies.  Each person in the church got 15 cookies, so to find the number of people in the church, we can divide the number of cookies by 15.  750 / 15 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
100 guests each brought 15 cookies for a total of 100 * 15 = 1500 cookies.  The bride gives 1/2 of the cookies to the church.  So she gives 1500 / 2 = 750 cookies to the church.  Since each person in the church gets 15 cookies, we can divide the number of cookies by the number of cookies per person to get the number of people in the church.  750 / 15 is 50.

[EXP] 601: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Doctor Jones spends 9 hours at the clinic.  He spends 20 minutes per inpatient, and he has 9 inpatients so that will be 9 x 20 = 180 minutes or 3 hours.  He also spends 30 minutes per appointment and has 10 appointments, so that will be 30 x 10 = 300 minutes or 5 hours.  The total time he spends is 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours.  So he will have 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records.  The answer is 1. 
9 hours are spent at the clinic.  For the inpatients, it takes 20 minutes per inpatient.  9 inpatients * 20 minutes per inpatient is 180 minutes.  180 minutes is 180 / 60 = 3 hours.  It takes 3 hours to do the rounds for the inpatients.  There are 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes, so that is 10 * 30 = 300 minutes or 300 / 60 = 5 hours.  So 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours are spent on the rounds and appointments.  The total time spent is 8 hours.  So we subtract this from the 9 hours initially spent at the clinic.  9 - 8 = 1.  The answer is 1. 
9 patients will take 9 x 20 minutes = 180 minutes to check.  Convert minutes to hours: 180 minutes = 180/60 = 3 hours

Doctor Jones now has 9 hours - 3 hours = 6 hours left. 

He also has 10 appointments that take 30 minutes each.  10 * 30 = 300 minutes to check his appointments.  Again, convert to hours: 300 minutes = 300/60 = 5 hours. 

So, in total, Doctor Jones will use 3 hours to check patients and 5 hours for appointments.  This leaves him with 9 - 3 - 5 = 1 hour to update his records.

20 minutes for cake batter, 30 minutes to bake, 2 hours to cool, and 10 minutes to frost adds up to 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.  If Jordan wants to serve the cake at 5:00 pm, and it takes 3 hours to make it, then she has to start making the cake at 2:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
 Jordan needs 20 minutes to make the cake batter.  Then 30 minutes to bake the cake.  So that is 20 + 30 = 50 minutes for the cake batter and baking.  After cooling, 2 hours is 120 minutes.  After frosting, 10 more minutes are needed.  So total time is 50 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.  5:00 pm - 180 minutes is the time Jordan can start making the cake.  5:00 pm - 180 minutes is 2:00 pm.

 Lisa and Peter together sold 64 chocolate bars.  Lisa sold 3. 5 boxes and Peter sold 4. 5 boxes.  So the total number of boxes is 3. 5 + 4. 5 = 8 boxes.  Since they sold 64 chocolate bars in total, each box must contain 64 ÷ 8 = 8 chocolate bars.  The answer is 8. 
 Let's first calculate the number of chocolate bars Lisa and Peter sold together.  Lisa sold 3. 5 boxes and Peter sold 4. 5 boxes, so together they sold 3. 5 + 4. 5 = 8 boxes.  Since they sold a total of 64 chocolate bars, that means there are 64 chocolate bars per 8 boxes.  To find the number of chocolate bars per box, divide the total number of chocolate bars (64) by the total number of boxes (8).  64 / 8 = 8.

[EXP] 604: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 480, [output]: 25 dollars is the cost for renting the studio, and 1. 5 dollars per student, per session.  If there are 10 students, it would be 1. 5 x 10 = 15 dollars per session for the students.  So the total for each session would be 25 + 15 = 40 dollars.  The studio is rented for 3 days a week, so that is 40 x 3 = 120 dollars per week.  In one month, it would be 120 x 4 = 480 dollars.  The answer is 480. 
1.  First, calculate how much the studio earns in one day: 
25 dollars (rent) + 10 students x $1. 50 = 25 + 15 = 40 dollars per day.  
Two more days are also rented, so 3 days in total.  
40 * 3 = 120.  
2.  In a month, the studio is rented for 4 weeks.  
120 * 4 = 480.  
The answer is 480. 
3 days a week, for a month (4 weeks), the studio is rented 3 x 4 = 12 times.  12 times for 10 students, each payment of 1. 50 per student, so the total student payment is 12 x 10 x 1. 50 = 180 dollars. 
Plus, each time the studio is rented, there is a fixed cost of 25 dollars, so for 12 times, the fixed cost is 25 x 12 = 300 dollars. 
Total earnings in a month are 180 + 300 = 480 dollars.  The answer is 480.

Since each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, in 12 months, each will give birth to 12 * 4 = 48 babies.  Since there are 30 female porcupines, the total number of new babies will be 30 * 48 = 1440.  50 (the original population) + 1440 is 1490.  The answer is 1490. 
 There are originally 50 porcupines in the park.  The number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population, so the number of female porcupines is 50 * 3/5 = 30.  If each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, the number of babies born each month is 30 * 4 = 120.  Since this is a yearly problem, the number of babies born in a year is 12 * 120 = 1440.  So the new total number of porcupines will be 50 + 1440 = 1490.  The answer is 1490. 
50 is the total population of porcupines.  3/5 of the total is 50 * (3/5) = 30.  So there are 30 female porcupines.  Each female gives birth to 4 babies per month.  In a year, there are 12 months.  So there will be 12 * 30 * 4 = 1440 new porcupines.  Since there were originally 50, the total porcupine population after a year will be 50 + 1440 = 1490.  The answer is 1490. 
50 is the total population of porcupines.  3/5 of the total population is female porcupines.  So the number of female porcupines is 50 x 3/5 = 30.  Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month.  There are 12 months in a year.  30 x 12 x 4 is the total number of new porcupines.  So 30 x 12 x 4 = 1440.  There are 1440 new porcupines.

 Let's start by using the information that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks.  This means that the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14. 

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11. 

In total, there are 9 red sticks, 14 blue sticks, and 11 yellow sticks.  The total number of sticks is:

9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34

The answer is 34. 
 There are 9 red sticks.  There are 5 more blue sticks than red, so they have 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  There are 3 less yellow sticks than blue, so they have 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  To find the total number of sticks, we add 9 + 14 + 11 = 34 sticks.  The answer is 34. 
 There are 9 red sticks.  The number of blue sticks is 5 more than the red sticks, which means 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.  The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, which means 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  The total number of sticks is 9 + 14 + 11 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
 There are 9 red sticks.  If the number of blue sticks is 5 more than the red sticks, then the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.  If the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, then the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.  The total number of sticks is the sum of the red, blue, and yellow sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34. 

The answer is 34. 
 Let's start by using the information that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks.  This means that the blue sticks are 9 + 5 = 14. 

Then, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks.  So, the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11. 

Finally, we add up the number of sticks to find the total number of sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34. 

The answer is 34. 
 We'll start by finding the number of blue sticks.  Since they have 5 more blue sticks than red, we can write an equation:

Red sticks + 5 = Blue sticks
9 + 5 = Blue sticks
Blue sticks = 14

Then, the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so:

Blue sticks - 3 = Yellow sticks
14 - 3 = Yellow sticks
Yellow sticks = 11

Finally, we add the numbers of sticks together:

Red sticks: 9
Blue sticks: 14
Yellow sticks: 11
Total sticks: 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

 Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours.  So he traveled 55 x 4 = 220 miles.  Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours, so he traveled 45 x 10 = 450 miles.  To find how many miles farther Shandy drove, subtract Matteo's distance from Shandy's distance: 450 - 220 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
 Since Matteo traveled at 55 miles per hour, in 4 hours he drove 55 * 4 = 220 miles.   Since Shandy traveled at 45 miles per hour, in 10 hours she drove 45 * 10 = 450 miles.   Shandy drove 450 - 220 = 230 miles farther than Matteo.   The answer is 230.

 Let's first find out how many laps each person can run.  Bethany can run 10 laps.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.  Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps.  10 - 5 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
 Bethany can run 10 laps per hour.  Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps per hour.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps per hour.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps per hour. 

Now we can find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.  Bethany can run 10 laps per hour and Quinn can run 5 laps per hour.  The difference is 10 - 5 = 5 laps. 

The answer is 5 laps. 
 Bethany can run 10 laps.  Trey can run 4 more laps, so that is 10 + 4 = 14 laps.  Shaelyn can run half as many as Trey, so that is 14 / 2 = 7 laps.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so that is 7 - 2 = 5 laps.  

To find the difference in laps run between Bethany and Quinn, we need to subtract the number of laps Quinn runs from Bethany: 10 - 5 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
 Bethany can run 10 laps.  Trey can run 4 more laps, so 10 + 4 = 14.  Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so that is 14 / 2 = 7 laps.  Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so 7 - 2 = 5 laps.  To find out the difference in laps between Bethany and Quinn, subtract the number of laps Quinn can run from the number of laps Bethany can run.  So 10 - 5 = 5.  The answer is 5.

[EXP] 612: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6000, [output]:  Let's solve the problem step by step. 

On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity, which is 18000 * 1/4 = 4500 gallons.  Ms.  B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, which is 4500 * 3/4 = 3375 gallons.  Total water pumped on the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons. 

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day, which is 4500 * 2/3 = 3000 gallons.  Ms.  B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 3375 * 1/3 = 1125 gallons.  Total water pumped on the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons. 

Total water pumped on both days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. 

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.  So, the remaining water needed to fill the tank is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.  The answer is 6000. 
1/4 of the tank's capacity is 1/4 x 18000 = 4500 gallons.  If Ms.  B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, then Ms.  B pumped 4500 * 3/4 = 3375 gallons.  So in total, 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons were pumped the first day.  Then, on the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 as much as on the first day, so she pumped 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.  Ms.  B pumped 1/3 as much as the first day, so she pumped 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.  So an additional 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons were pumped the second day.  In total, 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons were pumped.  So there are still 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons remaining.  The answer is 6000. 
 A tank has 18000 gallons.  Let's find out how much is filled in the first day.  Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank, which is 18000 / 4 = 4500 gallons.  Ms.  B filled 3/4 as much as Wanda, which is 4500 * 3/4 = 3375 gallons.  So the total filled in the first day is 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.  
On the second day, Wanda filled 2/3 as much water as she did the day before, which is 4500 * 2/3 = 3000 gallons.  Ms.  B filled 1/3 as much as she did the day before, which is 3375 * 1/3 = 1125 gallons.  So the total filled in the second day is 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons.  
Total filled in two days is 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.  18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons are remaining.  The answer is 6000. 
 A tank has a capacity of 18,000 gallons.  First day, Wanda pumps 1/4 of 18,000 gallons, which is 1/4 * 18,000 = 4,500 gallons.  Ms.  B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, so 0. 75 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.  In total, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.  On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of 4500 gallons which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.  Ms.  B pumped 1/3 of 3375 gallons which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.  In total they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day.  Total total, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12,000 gallons.  So 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons are remaining.  The answer is 6000. 
 First, let's calculate the total number of gallons Wanda pumped: On the first day, she filled 1/4 of 18000 gallons, which is 18000/4 = 4500 gallons.  On the second day, she pumped 2/3 of this, which is 2/3 x 4500 = 3000 gallons.  This means Wanda pumped a total of 4500 + 3000 = 7500 gallons.  

Now, let's calculate the total number of gallons Ms.  B pumped: On the first day, she pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, who pumped 4500 gallons.  This means Ms.  B pumped 3/4 x 4500 = 3375 gallons.  On the second day, she only pumped 1/3 of that, which is 1/3 x 3375 = 1125 gallons.  This means Ms.  B pumped a total of 3375 + 1125 = 4500 gallons.  

So, the total number of gallons pumped in two days is 7500 + 4500 = 12000 gallons.  The tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, so the number of gallons remaining is 18000 - 12000 = 6000.  The answer is 6000.

[EXP] 613: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 94, [output]:  Let's break this problem into smaller parts. 

Maria starts by charging her power bank, but then disconnects it before it's fully charged.  Let's assume the power bank had x as its capacity when she started charging it. 

Maria then loses 9% of the total capacity each hour.  For 5 hours, the total loss is 5 x 9% = 45%.  So, the battery charge left is 100% - 45% = 55%. 

After that, for 3 hours, she loses 7% of the capacity each hour.  So, the total loss is 3 x 7% = 21%.  Now, her power bank's charge left is 55% - 21% = 34%. 

Now, we know she has 28% of the charge left.  So, we set up an equation:

28% = x - (45% + 21%)

To simplify the equation, we can divide both sides by 100:

0. 28 = x - 0. 66

Add 0. 66 to both sides:

0. 94 = x

So, her power bank had 94% charge when she went to the park.  Since we're looking for the charge before she started losing power, we multiply 94% by the original capacity (100%) to get:

94% of 100% = 0. 94 x 100% = 94%

The answer is 94.

[EXP] 614: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  First, we need to find out how much Janet makes each week in total.  She makes $10 per hour in wages and $15 per hour in tips, for a total of $25 per hour.  She works 40 hours a week, so her total weekly income is 25 * 40 = 1000 dollars. 

Janet wants to save 20% of the cost of the car for the downpayment.  20% of 10000 is 0. 2 * 10000 = 2000.  She wants to save 2000 dollars. 

To find out how many weeks it will take her to save 2000 dollars, we divide 2000 by her weekly income: 2000 / 1000 = 2.  The answer is 2 weeks. 
 Janet gets a wage of 10 dollars an hour and a tip of 15 dollars an hour.  Together, she makes 10 + 15 = 25 dollars an hour.  Per week, she works 40 hours, so she makes 25 * 40 = 1000 dollars. 

First, we need to calculate 20% of the cost of the car: 10000 * 0. 20 = 2000 dollars. 

To find out how many weeks she needs to work to save the down payment, we divide the down payment by her weekly earnings: 2000 / 1000 = 2. 

The answer is 2. 
 To know how much money Janet will make, first we need to find out her hourly wage.  She makes $10 an hour from wages, so $10 * 40 = $400.  From tips, she makes $15 an hour, so $15 * 40 = $600.  In total, she makes $400 + $600 = $1000 a week.  She needs to save 20% of $10000, which is $2000.  If she makes $1000 a week and needs to save $2000, she will need to work 2000 / 1000 = 2 weeks.  The answer is 2. 
20% of the cost of the $10,000 car is 0. 20 x 10000 = 2000 dollars.  Janet will have to save this amount for the downpayment. 

Janet will earn 10 + 15 dollars an hour, which is 25 dollars an hour.  She works 40 hours a week, so she will earn 40 x 25 = 1000 dollars a week. 

She will need to save 2000 dollars, and she will earn 1000 dollars a week.  She can save 2000 / 1000 = 2 weeks' worth of wages to reach her goal.  The answer is 2 weeks.

[EXP] 615: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total cost of the fruits Jamaar has already purchased:

* 3 peaches = 3 x $0. 5 = $1. 50
* 4 pears = 4 x $0. 5 = $2. 00
* 2 kiwis = 2 x $1. 00 = $2. 00
* 5 apples = 5 x $0. 75 = $3. 75

Total cost of purchased fruits = $1. 50 + $2. 00 + $2. 00 + $3. 75 = $9. 25

Jamaar has $10 and has spent $9. 25 on fruits, so he has:

$10 - $9. 25 = $0. 75

left. 

Peaches, pears, kiwis, and apples cost a total of $1. 5 + $2 + $2 + $3. 75 = $9. 25, and plums cost $0. 25 each.  To find out how many plums he can buy, we need to subtract the total cost of the purchased fruits from the remaining amount:

$0. 75 - $9. 25 (total cost of purchased fruits) = $0. 75 - $9. 25 = -$8. 5

Since you can't buy a negative number of plums, it means Jamaar has spent more than he initially had.  The original problem statement says he has $10, but he has spent $9. 25, so we need to add the initial amount to the remaining amount to get the expected negative result:

$10 - $9. 25 = $0. 75

This means Jamaar has spent more than he had and has a negative amount left, so he can't buy any plums. 

The answer is 0 plums.

Each pack has 60 pieces, so the total number of pieces she gave away is 13 * 60 = 780.  She gave it to 10 friends, so each friend received 780 / 10 = 78 pieces.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs have 60 pieces each, so there are 15 x 60 = 900 pieces in total.  Anne kept 2 packs, so she kept 60 x 2 = 120 pieces.  900 - 120 = 780 pieces left.  Divide the 780 pieces by 10 friends, so each friend gets 780/10 = 78 pieces.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs with 60 sweets in each pack means there are originally 15 x 60 = 900 sweets in total.  Anne kept 2 packs, which is 2 x 60 = 120 sweets.  So she gave away 900 - 120 = 780 sweets.  She gave the sweets away to her 10 friends, so each friend receives 780 / 10 = 78 sweets.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs with 60 pieces in each pack means originally there are 15 * 60 = 900 pieces.  Anne kept 2 packs, so the number of pieces she kept is 2 * 60 = 120.  So the remaining pieces are 900 - 120 = 780.  Since there were 10 friends, each friend got 780 / 10 = 78 pieces.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs originally.  Anne kept 2 packs.  15 - 2 = 13 packs given to her friends.  Each friend got an equal share of sweets.  So 60 * 13 = 780 pieces of sweets were given.  We need to divide 780 by 10 friends.  780 / 10 = 78.  The answer is 78. 
15 packs in total, with 60 pieces in each pack.  So there are 15 * 60 = 900 pieces in total. 

Anne keeps 2 packs, which is 2 * 60 = 120 pieces.  900 - 120 = 780 pieces left. 

The rest is divided equally among her 10 friends, so 780 / 10 = 78 pieces per friend.

[EXP] 618: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 45, [output]: 72 pictures were uploaded to Facebook.  These pictures were divided into 8 albums, so 72 / 8 = 9 pictures per album.  There were 3 albums of selfies and 2 albums of portraits.  So the total number of selfies is 9 * 3 = 27 and the total number of portraits is 9 * 2 = 18.  The answer is 27 selfies and 18 portraits. 
72 pictures were uploaded in total.  To find out how many pictures are in each type of album, let's divide the total by 8 albums.  72 / 8 = 9.  Each album has 9 pictures.  The 3 album of selfies have 3 * 9 = 27 selfies.  The 2 albums of portraits have 2 * 9 = 18 portraits.  The answer is 27 selfies and 18 portraits. 
72 pictures were uploaded to Facebook.  These were split into 8 albums.  Each album has the same number of pictures, which you can find out by dividing 72 by 8, which is 9.  Since there are 8 albums, and 3 were selfies only, 3 x 9 = 27 selfies.  The remaining pictures, which are 72 - (3 x 9) = 72 - 27 = 45, are portraits.  The answer is 27 selfies and 45 portraits. 
72 pictures were uploaded.  They went into 8 albums.  Olivia divided the pictures evenly across the albums, so each album had 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.  

The 3 albums of selfies had 9 pictures each, so a total of 3 x 9 = 27 selfies.  

The remaining pictures went into the 2 portrait albums.  So, the 2 remaining albums had a total of 72 - 27 = 45 pictures.  

45 pictures spread evenly across 2 albums is 45 / 2 = 22. 5 (but we can't have 0. 5 pictures so we round down).  So, 22 portraits. 

The answer is 27 selfies and 22 portraits. 
72 pictures in total.  Those are evenly distributed into 8 albums, so each album gets 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.  Since 5 albums were selfies or portraits, that means 5 x 9 = 45 pictures are either selfies or portraits.  Since 72 - 45 = 27 are left over, those are not selfies or portraits, they are other types of pictures.  So the remaining 27 pictures are not relevant to the question, we just need to know the number of selfies and portraits. 

So, since 5 albums were selfies or portraits, we can conclude that:
- 3 albums were selfies, so 3 x 9 = 27 selfies
- 2 albums were portraits, so 2 x 9 = 18 portraits

The answer is 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

 It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages.  To read 18 pages, he will need 18 / 3 = 6 groups of 10 minutes.  6 x 10 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
18 pages is 6 sets of 3 pages, since 3 * 6 = 18.  It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages, so to read 6 sets of 3 pages, it will take 6 * 10 = 60 minutes.  The answer is 60. 
3 pages take 10 minutes to read.  So 1 page takes 10 / 3 = 3. 33 minutes.  James read 18 pages.  So the total time he spent reading is 18 * 3. 33 = 60 minutes.  The answer is 60. 
10 minutes is the time it takes James to read 3 pages.  To read 18 pages, he would read 18 ÷ 3 = 6 groups of 3 pages.  Since each group takes 10 minutes, 6 groups take 6 x 10 = 60 minutes.  The answer is 60. 
 James started by reading for 18 / 3 = 6 groups of 3 pages each.  Each group took 10 minutes, so 10 x 6 = 60 minutes.  The answer is 60. 
 It takes James 10 minutes to read 3 pages.  So he reads 3 pages in 10 minutes.  To find out how long James takes to read a single page, we can divide 10 by 3.  10 / 3 = 3. 33.  So James takes 3. 33 minutes to read a single page. 

Since he read 18 pages, we can multiply the number of pages by the time it takes to read one page: 18 * 3. 33 = 60.  So James took 60 minutes to read his book.  The answer is 60.

We know she sells small stuffed animals for 4 dollars each.  We know also that large stuffed animals are sold for three times the price of small stuffed animals.  So, large stuffed animals are 4 x 3 = 12 dollars each. 

Now we know that Teresa earns 120 dollars from the sales of small and large stuffed animals.  She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  Let's say she sold L large stuffed animals and 2L small stuffed animals.  Then, we can make the equation:

4 * 2L + 12 * L = 120

Combine like terms:

16L + 12L = 120

Combine the left side:

28L = 120

Divide by 28:

L = 4

So Teresa sold 4 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2L = 8 small stuffed animals.

[EXP] 627: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 43200, [output]: 12 pounds is the amount one dwarf can mine with bare hands.  With an iron pickaxe, it would be 12 x 2 = 24 pounds.  With a steel pickaxe, it's 24 + 50% = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds. 

Now, there are 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes.  In one day, they can mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore. 

In 30 days, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds of ore. 

The answer is 43200. 
1 dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with bare hands.  With an iron pickaxe, 2 x 12 = 24 pounds per day per dwarf.  With a steel pickaxe, 24 x 1. 5 = 36 pounds per day per dwarf.  With 40 dwarves mining 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe, they can mine 40 x 36 = 1440 pounds per day.  A month is 30 days, so in a month, they can mine 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.  The answer is 43200. 
1 dwarf can mine 12 pounds of ore per day with bare hands.  He can mine 12 x 2 = 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe.  With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 24 x (1 + 0. 5) = 36 pounds per day of ore.  

After 30 days, one dwarf can mine 30 x 36 = 1080 pounds of ore per month. 

40 dwarves mining with steel pickaxes will mine 40 x 1080 = 43200 pounds of ore in 30 days.  

The answer is 43200. 
40 dwarves with steel pickaxes is 40 times the ore mined by 1 dwarf with a steel pickaxe.  Let's find how much ore one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines per day. 

A dwarf mines twice as much ore per day with an iron pickaxe than with his bare hands.  So he mines 12 * 2 = 24 pounds of ore per day with an iron pickaxe.  With a steel pickaxe, he mines 50% more than with an iron pickaxe.  So he mines 24 + 24 * 0. 5 = 24 + 12 = 36 pounds of ore per day with a steel pickaxe. 

Now, since there are 30 days in a month, a dwarf can mine 30 * 36 = 1080 pounds of ore in a month with a steel pickaxe.  For 40 dwarves, the total ore mined would be 40 * 1080 = 43200 pounds of ore in a month. 

The answer is 43200. 
1 dwarf has a steel pickaxe.  With an iron pickaxe, he can mine twice as much as with bare hands, which is 2 x 12 = 24 pounds a day.  With a steel pickaxe, he can mine 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, so 24 + 50% of 24 = 36 pounds a day. 

Now we need to figure out how many pounds 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine in a month with 30 days. 
We need to multiply the pounds per dwarf by 40 dwarves.  36 pounds a day per dwarf x 40 dwarves is 1440 pounds per day. 
1440 pounds a day for 30 days is 1440 x 30 = 43200 pounds. 

The answer is 43200.

[EXP] 628: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  The first package has 2 sandwiches for $3.  So the price per sandwich is $1. 50.  The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.  So the price per sandwich is $6/4 = $1. 50.  Since the prices are proportional, the third package will also have a price per sandwich of $1. 50.  The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $1. 50 * 8 = $12.  The answer is 12. 
 The prices are proportional.  To figure out the price of the package with 8 sandwiches, we can find the price per sandwich for each package: the first package has 2 sandwiches and costs $3, so the price per sandwich is 3 / 2 = 1. 5.  The second package has 4 sandwiches and costs $6, so the price per sandwich is 6 / 4 = 1. 5.  Since the prices are proportional, the price per sandwich for the third package will also be 1. 5.  For 8 sandwiches, the price will be 1. 5 * 8 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
2 sandwiches for 3 dollars means the cost per sandwich is 3 / 2 = 1. 5 dollars.  4 sandwiches for 6 dollars means the cost per sandwich is 6 / 4 = 1. 5 dollars.  This shows that the prices are indeed proportional. 

We can find the cost per sandwich for the first two packages: 1. 5 dollars.  Now we can multiply this by the number of sandwiches in the package with 8 sandwiches to find the cost:

8 sandwiches * 1. 5 dollars per sandwich = 12 dollars

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 629: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Tom has to buy a bedroom set for 3000 dollars.  He sells his old bedroom for 1000 dollars, so he has to pay 3000 - 1000 = 2000 dollars.  He has to pay 10% each month.  2000 * 0. 1 = 200.  The answer is 200. 
 Tom originally has 1000 dollars after selling his old bedroom.  So he needs to pay for 3000 - 1000 = 2000 more.  10% of 2000 is 10/100 * 2000 = 200.  The answer is 200. 
3000 is the price of the bedroom set.  He sold his old bedroom set for 1000, so he has to pay 3000 - 1000 = 2000 dollars for the new bedroom set. 

Now, he has to pay 10% monthly.  To find 10% of 2000, we do 2000 * 0. 10 = 200. 

The answer is 200. 
 Tom has 3000 dollars that he needs to pay for the bedroom set.  He pays 1000 dollars by selling his old bedroom.  So he has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 dollars left to pay.  To calculate the monthly payment, we need to first calculate the percentage.  10% of 2000 is 0. 1 x 2000 = 200.  So Tom has to pay $200 per month.  The answer is 200. 
 Let's first find out how much Tom still has to pay for the bedroom set. 

Tom buys a bedroom set for 3000, and he gets 1000 from selling his old bedroom, so he has to pay 3000 - 1000 = 2000. 

Next, he has to pay 10% per month.  10% is the same as 0. 1, so we multiply the amount left to be paid (2000) by 0. 1 to find the monthly payment. 

2000 * 0. 1 = 200

The answer is 200.

So in total she had 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.  40% of 25 red balloons means 0. 4 x 25 = 10 red balloons were burst.  So she had 44 - 10 = 34 balloons left.  Half of the 12 yellow balloons means 6 yellow balloons were released.  So she had 34 - 6 = 28 balloons left.  Then, she added 75% of 8 blue balloons.  75% means 0. 75.  So she added 0. 75 x 8 = 6 blue balloons.  28 + 6 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
 Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.  So originally, she had a total of 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons.  
40% of 25 red balloons burst.  So 40/100 * 25 = 10 red balloons burst.  25 - 10 = 15 red balloons remained.  
Half of the 12 yellow balloons were released.  So 12/2 = 6 yellow balloons were released.  12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons remained.  
She added 75% of the 8 blue balloons to her remaining clutch.  75/100 * 8 = 6 blue balloons were added.  
She had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.  In total, she had 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.  The answer is 34. 
 Sally had 25 red balloons.  40% of 25 is 0. 4 * 25 = 10.  So 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons were left.  She had 7 green balloons.  These remained unchanged.  She had 12 yellow balloons.  Half of 12 is 6, so 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons were left after releasing half of them.  She had 0 blue balloons initially.  Then she found 8, so she had 8 blue balloons.  75% of 8 is 0. 75 * 8 = 6.  So she added 6 blue balloons to her collection.  She had 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.  In total, she had 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons left.  The answer is 34. 
1.  Sally starts with 25 red balloons.  40% of 25 is 0. 4 * 25 = 10.  So 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons. 

2.  Sally is left with 7 green balloons and 12 yellow balloons.  But she accidentally released half of the yellow balloons, so 12 / 2 = 6 balloons were released, leaving 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons. 

3.  She then finds 8 blue balloons caught in a tree.  75% of this is 0. 75 * 8 = 6.  So she adds 6 blue balloons to her remaining 15 red balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 7 green balloons.  15 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 34. 

The answer is 34. 
 Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.  40% of the 25 red balloons burst, which is 40% x 25 = 10 red balloons that burst.  After that, she is left with 15 red balloons.  Half of the 12 yellow balloons were released, which is 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons.  After releasing those, she has 6 yellow balloons left.  Then, she found 8 blue balloons, and got 75% of them, which is 0. 75 x 8 = 6 blue balloons.  Now, she has 15 red balloons, 7 green balloons, 6 yellow balloons, and 6 blue balloons.  15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.  The answer is 34. 
 Sally started with 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons, originally. 

Red balloons burst: 40% of 25 = 0. 4 x 25 = 10 red balloons
25 - 10 = 15 remaining red balloons

Yellow balloons released: 12 / 2 = 6 balloons released
6 remaining yellow balloons

Added blue balloons: 8, then 75% of 8 is 0. 75 x 8 = 6 blue balloons

[EXP] 631: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

1.  There's a 50% chance that tomorrow, Marcus will have a substitute teacher who won't collect his homework.  If this happens, he doesn't have to do his homework. 

2.  If it's not a substitute teacher, there's a 40% chance that the teacher will give everyone an extension on the homework.  If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to do the homework. 

3.  If it's not a substitute teacher and there isn't an extension, there's a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment.  If this happens, Marcus doesn't have to do the homework. 

To find the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to figure out the opposite: the chance that N EITHER the substitute will collect the homework, NOR the teacher will give an extension, NOR Marcus will convince the teacher his dog ate the homework. 

We can break this down into 4 mutually exclusive scenarios:

1.  Substitute teacher + collects homework
2.  Normal teacher + no extension
3.  Normal teacher + extension
4.  Marcus convinces the teacher that his dog ate it

The probability of these scenarios are:

1.  0. 5 (50%) * 1. 0 (100% if the sub collects homework) = 0. 5
2.  0. 5 * 0. 6 (60% if there's no extension) = 0. 3
3.  0. 5 * 0. 4 (40% if there's an extension) = 0. 2
4.  0. 5 * 0. 8 (80% if he convinces the teacher) = 0. 4

To add these up, we subtract each one from 1. 0:

1 - 0. 5 = 0. 5
1 - 0. 5 - 0. 3 = 0. 2
1 - 0. 5 - 0. 3 - 0. 2 = 0. 0
1 - 0. 5 - 0. 3 - 0. 2 - 0. 4 = 0

So the cumulative probability is 0.  So the answer is 0%.

 Amor starts with 50 dollars.  Parmesan cheese costs 11 dollars per pound.  She bought 2 pounds, so she spent 11 x 2 = 22 dollars on Parmesan.  Mozzarella cheese costs 6 dollars per pound.  She bought 3 pounds, so she spent 6 x 3 = 18 dollars on mozzarella.  Total, she spent 22 + 18 = 40 dollars.  She has 50 - 40 = 10 dollars left to buy meat.  The answer is 10. 
 Amor started with $50.  2 pounds of Parmesan cheese will cost 2 x $11 = $22.  3 pounds of mozzarella cheese will cost 3 x $6 = $18.   $22 + $18 = $40 is the total cost of the cheese.  $50 - $40 = $10.  The answer is 10. 
 Mozzarella cheese costs $6 per pound and Amor buys 3 pounds.  That's 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.  Parmesan cheese costs $11 per pound and Amor buys 2 pounds.  That's 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.  In total, Amor spent 18 + 22 = 40 dollars.  She started with 50 dollars.  She will have 50 - 40 dollars left.  50 - 40 is 10.  The answer is 10. 
 Amor started with 50 dollars.  She bought 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese which will be 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.  She also bought 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese which will be 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.  The total cost of her cheese is 22 + 18 = 40 dollars.  She has 50 - 40 = 10 dollars left.  The answer is 10. 
 First, we need to find out the total cost of the cheese.  The cost of 2 pounds of Parmesan is 2 x 11 = 22.  The cost of 3 pounds of mozzarella is 3 x 6 = 18.  So the total cost is 22 + 18 = 40.  Amor starts with $50.  After buying the cheese, she has 50 - 40 dollars left.  50 - 40 is 10.  The answer is 10. 
 Amor starts with 50 dollars.   She buys 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at 11 per pound, which is 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.   She also buys 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at 6 per pound, which is 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.   In total, she pays 22 + 18 = 40 dollars.   After buying the cheese, she has 50 - 40 = 10 dollars left.

[EXP] 639: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's first calculate how much money Jim lost by not working during college.  

He got $25,000 a year for 4 years.  $25,000 * 4 is $100,000. 

He also got $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.  $50,000 * 4 is $200,000. 

So the total amount of money he needs to earn is $100,000 + $200,000 = $300,000. 

Since his college degree tripled his income, he will now make $25,000 * 3 = $75,000 a year. 

To find out how many years it will take him to earn the money, we can divide the total amount of money by his annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000 = 4 years

The answer is 4. 
 Let's first calculate the total amount of money Jim lost while in college and the total amount of loans he got. 

Jim got $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years.  So he got 50,000 x 4 = $200,000 in loans. 

Before college, he had a $25,000 a year job, so he would have earned 25,000 x 4 = $100,000 for 4 years.  But now he is making $75,000 a year after graduation (because his job was tripled), so the money he could have earned in those 4 years is 75,000 x 4 = $300,000.  The difference is $200,000 which is the money he "lost" while in college. 

Now, Jim has a choice to pay back the $200,000 loan with the $50,000 he makes each year after graduating, or he has to work some years to pay it back. 

If Jim pays back the loan with his $50,000 a year, it would take him 200,000 ÷ 50,000 = 4 years to pay it back.  But in that time, he will have earned $200,000 in salaries (50,000 x 4), but he will be paying back $200,000. 

So, it will take Jim another 4 years after paying back the loan to earn the same amount of money he will have earned if he hadn't gone to college and was still making $25,000 a year.  The answer is 4 years.

The fabric pieces need to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, so they will be 8 feet long and 10 feet wide. 

The area of each piece is 8 * 10 = 80 square feet. 

Since Jim needs 2 pieces, he needs a total of 2 * 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.  The answer is 160. 
 A king-sized bed is 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.  Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.  So the length of the fabric pieces will be 6 + 2 = 8 feet long, and the width will be 8 + 2 = 10 feet wide.  So the area of each piece of fabric is length * width, or 8 * 10 = 80 square feet.  There are two pieces of fabric, so Jim needs to buy 80 * 2 square feet of fabric.  80 * 2 is 160.  The answer is 160.

On Tuesday, they delivered 1/5 as many as Monday, which is 425 / 5 = 85.  17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102.  On Wednesday, they delivered 2 times as many as on Tuesday, which is 102 * 2 = 204.  5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209.  425 + 102 + 209 = 736.  The answer is 736. 
425 letters were delivered on Monday.  One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85.  17 more letters than 85 is 85 + 17 = 102.  So 102 letters were delivered on Tuesday.  Twice 102 is 204.  5 more than 204 is 204 + 5 = 209.  So 209 letters were delivered on Wednesday. 

In total, the post office delivered 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters.  The answer is 736. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

Monday, the post office delivered 425 letters. 
Tuesday, they delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.  One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85, and 17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102.  So they delivered 102 letters on Tuesday. 

Wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday.  Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 x 102 = 204, and 5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209.  So they delivered 209 letters on Wednesday. 

In total, they delivered 425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.  The answer is 736. 
1/5 * 425 = 85.  (One fifth of 425 is 85. ) So on Tuesday, they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.  On Wednesday, they delivered 2 * 102 + 5 = 209 letters.  On Monday, they delivered 425 letters.  Adding those numbers together is 425 + 102 + 209 = 736.  The answer is 736. 
425 letters were delivered on Monday.  There was a delivery of 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday.  One-fifth of 425 is 425 ÷ 5 = 85.  17 more than that would be 85 + 17 = 102.  The delivery on Tuesday was 102 letters.  On Wednesday, there was a delivery of 5 more than twice as many as Tuesday.  Twice as many as 102 is 102 x 2 = 204.  5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209.  The total number of letters delivered is the sum of Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.  425 + 102 + 209 is 736.  The answer is 736.

5 cities in each of 26 countries, so there are 5 x 26 = 130 cities.  Each city has 1000 people, so 130 x 1000 = 130000 people.  The answer is 130000. 
 There are originally 26 countries in South America.  Each country has 5 cities with 1000 people each.  To find the number of people in each country, multiply 5 cities by 1000 people per city, which gives 5 x 1000 = 5000.

Xavier was 4 feet originally, which is 4 * 12 = 48 inches.  He grew 3 inches.  So, his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches. 

Cole was 50 inches originally and grew 2 inches.  So, his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches. 

Now, find the difference between their new heights. 

52 - 51 = 1

The answer is 1. 
 Let's first find out Xavier's new height.  Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches.  So his new height is 4 feet + 3 inches = 51 inches. 

Since Xavier is now 51 inches tall, let's find Cole's new height.  Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches.  So his new height is 50 inches + 2 inches = 52 inches. 

To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's height now, subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height.  52 inches - 51 inches = 1 inch.  The answer is 1 inch. 
 Let's first convert Xavier's height from feet to inches.  4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.  Then Xavier grew 3 inches more, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches. 

Cole's initial height was 50 inches and he grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches. 

To find the difference between Cole's and Xavier's height now, subtract Xavier's height from Cole's:

52 - 51 = 1 inch

So the answer is 1 inch.

In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved x + 4 balls. 

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x/2 balls. 

In total, he retrieved x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19 balls. 

We can combine like terms: 3x/2 + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x/2 = 15

Multiply both sides by 2: 3x = 30

Divide both sides by 3: x = 10

So he retrieved 10 balls in the second set. 

In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved 10 + 4 = 14 balls. 

The answer is 14. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step! Let's say Rory retrieved x balls in the second set.  Then, he retrieved x + 4 balls in the first set (since he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second).  In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x/2 balls. 

We know that Rory retrieved 19 tennis balls in total, so the equation is:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

3x/2 + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 15

Multiply both sides by 2:

3x = 30

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the second set.  In the first set, he retrieved x + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 balls.  The answer is 14. 
 - Let's first figure out the number of balls retrieved in the second set.  Let "x" be the number of balls retrieved in the second set.  Since Rory retrieved half as many in the third set, he retrieved x/2 balls in the third set.  In total, he retrieved 4 balls more in the first set, so he retrieved x+4 balls in the first set.  In total, he retrieved 19 balls.  Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + x/2 + x+4 = 19.  First, we combine like terms: 3x/2 + 4 = 19.  Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x/2 = 15.  Multiply both sides by 2/3: x = 10.  So, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the second set.  In the first set, he retrieved 10 + 4 = 14 balls.  The answer is 14.

2007 is the starting year and 2010 is the end year.  To find the price, I'll calculate the depreciation for each year. 

1.  From 2007 to 2008, depreciation is 21% of 20000 = 0. 21 x 20000 = 4200.  So the price is 20000 - 4200 = 15800. 
2.  From 2008 to 2009, depreciation is 21% of 15800 = 0. 21 x 15800 = 3324.  So the price is 15800 - 3324 = 12476. 
3.  From 2009 to 2010, depreciation is 21% of 12476 = 0. 21 x 12476 = 2618.  So the price is 12476 - 2618 = 9868.

 Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.  So she drinks 8 * 30 = 240 cups in 30 days.  Then we need to find how many gallons that is.  There are 16 cups in a gallon.  So we can divide 240 cups by 16 cups to get the number of gallons: 240 / 16 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Ingrid drinks 8 cups per day.  For 30 days, she drinks 8 x 30 = 240 cups.  240 cups is how many gallons? 16 cups are in a gallon.  So we can divide 240 by 16 to get the number of gallons: 240 ÷ 16 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water per day.  In 30 days, she will drink 30 x 8 = 240 cups of water.  We need to find the number of gallons of water that is equivalent to 240 cups.  240 cups is the same as 240 / 16 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.  
If we want to know how much water she drinks in 30 days, we need to multiply the amount she drinks per day by the number of days: 

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups of water


Since there are 16 cups in a gallon, we can now divide the total cups of water by 16 to find out how many gallons she drinks in 30 days:

240 cups / 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons


So Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.  The answer is 15. 
8 cups per day.  In 30 days, she will drink 8 * 30 = 240 cups.  16 cups per gallon, means 16/16 = 1, gallons.  So 1 gallon = 16 cups.  240 cups divided by 16 = 15 gallons.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 653: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Romeo started with 120 people on the train.  At the first stop, 20 more people boarded, so now there are 120 + 20 = 140 people.  At the second stop, 50 people descended and twice that number (100) boarded, so there are 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people now.  At the third stop, 80 people descended.  190 - 80 = 110.  The answer is 110. 
 Romeo starts with 120 people.  Then 20 more people board the train, making it 120 + 20 = 140 people.  At the second stop, 50 people leave and 50 * 2 = 100 people board.  So 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people are on the train.  At the third stop, 80 people leave, making it 190 - 80 = 110 people.  The answer is 110. 
 Romeo started with 120 people.  After 20 people boarded at the first stop, he had 120 + 20 = 140 people.  At the second stop, 50 people got off and 50 x 2 = 100 people boarded.  So he had 140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people.  Then, at the third stop, 80 people got off, leaving 190 - 80 = 110 people.  The answer is 110. 
 There were originally 120 people on the train.  At the first stop, 20 more people boarded, making it 120 + 20 = 140 people.  At the second stop, 50 people got off and twice that, or 100 people, got on.  140 - 50 + 100 = 190 people.  At the third stop, 80 people got off, leaving 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.  The answer is 110. 
120 people were on the train initially.  Then 20 people boarded, so the total number is 120 + 20 = 140.  At the next stop, 50 people left and 100 people boarded.  So the total number of people on the train is 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.  At the third station, 80 people left.  So the total number of people on the train is 190 - 80 = 110.  The answer is 110. 
 Romeo boards a train with 120 people.  20 more people board the train at the first stop.  So, 120 + 20 = 140.  At the second stop, 50 people descend from the train while twice that number boarded.  Twice 50 is 100.  So, 50 descend and 100 board.  140 - 50 + 100 = 190.  At the third stop, 80 people descend.  So, they had 190 people and 80 descend.  190 - 80 = 110.  The answer is 110. 
 Romeo board a train with 120 people.  After the first stop, 20 more board the train.  So, originally, there were 120 people on the train.  After adding 20, there are 120 + 20 = 140 people.  At the second stop, 50 people get out, and 50 x 2 = 100 get on.  So, there are 140 - 50 + 100 people now.  That is 190.  At the third stop, 80 people get off.  So 190 - 80 people are left.  190 - 80 is 110.  The answer is 110.

[EXP] 654: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 55, [output]: 1.  The tank top cost $10. 
2.  The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top.  So they cost $10 + 5 = $15. 
3.  The tennis shoes were originally $48 but were on sale for half price.  Half of $48 is $24.  So they cost $24. 
4.  The athletic socks cost $8, and she had a coupon for $2 off, so she paid $8 - $2 = $6 for the socks. 
5.  To find the total cost, we add up the cost of all the items: $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.  The answer is 55. 
 First, the tank top costs 10 dollars.  The running shorts cost 5 more than the top, so the shorts cost 10 + 5 = 15 dollars.  The shoes were 48 dollars originally but were on sale for half price, so the shoes cost 48 / 2 = 24.  The socks cost 8 dollars and had a 2 dollar coupon, so the socks cost 8 - 2 = 6 dollars.  Adding all together, 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55.  The answer is 55 dollars. 
 Alison bought a tank top for 10 dollars.  5 more dollars than the top cost means that the shorts cost 10 + 5 = 15 dollars. 

The tennis shoes cost 48 dollars, but were half off.  Half of 48 is 48 / 2 = 24.  So the shoes cost 48 - 24 = 24 dollars. 

Alison also bought 8 dollar socks, but with a 2 dollar coupon.  So the socks cost 8 - 2 = 6 dollars. 

To find the total cost, add all the costs: 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55 dollars. 

The answer is 55. 
1.  Alison spent 10 dollars on the tank top. 

2.  The pair of running shorts cost 5 more dollars than the tank top.  So they cost 10 + 5 = 15 dollars. 

3.  The shoes were originally 48 dollars but were on sale for half price.  So they cost 48 / 2 = 24 dollars. 

4.  The athletic socks are 8 dollars but also had a 2 dollar coupon.  So the total cost of the socks is 8 - 2 = 6 dollars. 

5.  Total amount spent = 10 + 15 + 24 + 6 = 55

[EXP] 655: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]: 200 SqFt is the total area of the kitchen floor.  We need to find out how many tiles we need to cover this area.  The area of a square is side^2, so for each tile, the area is 1ft * 1ft = 1 SqFt.  Since we need to cover 200 SqFt, we need 200 / 1 = 200 tiles.  Each tile costs $12, so the total cost is 200 * 12 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
 To find the total number of tiles needed, we need to divide the total area of the kitchen floor by the area of one tile.  The area of one tile is 1ft x 1ft = 1 square foot.  To find the total number of tiles, we need to divide 200 SqFt (the total area of the kitchen floor) by 1 SqFt (the area of one tile).  200 / 1 = 200 tiles. 

Now, we need to find the total cost.  The cost of each tile is $12.  To find the total cost, we multiply the number of tiles by the cost of one tile.  200 tiles x $12 per tile = $2400. 

The answer is 2400. 
 First, we need to find the number of tiles needed.  We have to calculate the total area of the tiles needed.  Since each tile is 1ft x 1ft = 1 SqFt, to cover a 200 SqFt floor, we need 200 / 1 = 200 tiles. 

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost will be 200 tiles * 12 dollars/tile = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
 To find out how many square tiles you need, we have to convert the area from sqft to square tiles.  Since each tile side is 1ft, that means each tile is 1ft x 1ft = 1 sqft.  To find out how many tiles you need, divide the total area by the area of each tile: 200 sqft (total area) / 1 sqft (area of each tile) = 200 tiles.  Each tile costs 12 dollars, so you need 200 x 12 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
 First, we need to calculate how many tiles it will take to cover the entire kitchen floor.  Let's divide the total area of the floor (200 SqFt) by the area of one tile.  The area of one tile is 1ft x 1ft = 1 SqFt.  So it would take 200 / 1 = 200 tiles to cover the floor. 

 Second, we need to calculate the total cost.  We know it costs 12 dollars per tile.  There are 200 tiles, so we multiply the number of tiles by the cost per tile.  200 x 12 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400.

[EXP] 656: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2304, [output]: 60% of 120 is 120 x 0. 6 = 72.  The normal cost is $120 a month, and the cost with accident is 60% more, which is 120 + 72 = 192.  So James pays $192 a month.  In a year, he pays 192 * 12 = 2,304.  The answer is 2,304. 
 James needs to calculate the cost of the insurance.  The normal cost of insurance is 120 dollars a month.  But since it's 60% more expensive, the new cost is 1. 6 x 120 = 192 dollars a month (1 x normal cost + 0. 6 x normal cost = new cost). 

Since he needs to calculate the cost for a year, he has to multiply the monthly cost by 12.  192 x 12 is 2,304.  The answer is 2,304.

 Greg starts with 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed.  5 sets of sheets need to be washed each week.  Since the laundry machine only allows 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, the total number of loads per week is 3.  In a year, there are 52 weeks.  52 * 3 is 156.  The answer is 156. 
 Greg washes 4 twin beds and 1 king bed.  4 twin beds are 4 x 2 = 8 twin sets.  1 king size bed is 1 king set.  That's 9 sets of sheets to wash every week.  In a year, 9 sets x 52 weeks = 468 sets of sheets.  Since he can wash 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time, he will need to do 468 ÷ 3 = 156 loads of laundry in a year.  The answer is 156. 
 Greg has to wash 4 twin beds and 1 king bed.  To wash the twin beds, he has to do so in sets of 2.  To wash the king bed, he has to wash one king at a time.  So, Greg has to do laundry in sets of 2 twin beds + 1 king bed = 3 sets of laundry per week.   There are 52 weeks in a year, so Greg will do 52 * 3 = 156 sets of laundry.  The answer is 156.

[EXP] 658: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 4 movies on Saturday, and half that number on Sunday, means 2 movies on Sunday.  In total, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies per weekend.  In 4 weeks, they will watch 6 * 4 = 24 movies.  The answer is 24. 
4 movies on saturday and half of 4, which is 2, on sunday.  So that is 4 + 2 = 6 movies per weekend.  In 4 weeks, that is 6 x 4 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
 Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.  On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies, which is 4/2 = 2.  So in a weekend, they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.  If they watch movies for 4 weeks, that is 6 movies a week times 4 weeks = 24 movies.  The answer is 24. 
4 movies on Saturday and half of that, 2 movies on Sunday, is 4 + 2 = 6 movies per weekend.  Now, in 4 weeks, there are 4 weekends.  So, 6 movies per weekend for 4 weekends will be 6 * 4 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
 Let's solve this problem by breaking it down:

Saturday: 4 movies
Sunday: half of Saturday's movies, which is 4 / 2 = 2 movies
Total movies per week: 4 + 2 = 6 movies

If they watch movies every weekend, that means they watch 6 movies per week. 

For 4 weeks, the total number of movies they can watch is:
6 movies/week x 4 weeks = 24 movies

The answer is 24. 
1st step: Saturday movies = 4 movies, Sunday movies = half of Saturday = 4 / 2 = 2 movies.  Total movies in a weekend = 4 + 2 = 6 movies.  4 weeks = 4 weekends.  Movies in 4 weeks = movies in 1 weekend * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24.  The answer is 24.

[EXP] 662: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 58, [output]:  Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes.  Then, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.  The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, so we can set up the equation x + (x + 18) = 98. 

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes.  Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes. 

The answer is 58. 
 Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes.  Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.  

The total time taken to make the meal is 98 minutes, which is the sum of Donovan's part and Betsy's part. 

x + (x + 18) = 98

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide by 2:

x = 40

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes.  Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes. 

The answer is 58. 
 Let's start by saying that Donovan's part took x minutes.  Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.  The total time it took to make the meal is 98 minutes, which can be written as x + (x + 18) = 98. 

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 2x + 18 = 98. 

Subtract 18 from both sides to get: 2x = 80. 

Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of x: x = 40. 

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes.  Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, so it took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes. 

The answer is 58. 
 If we let x be the length of Donovan's part, then Betsy's part was x + 18.  Since the total time is 98, we can write the equation x + (x + 18) = 98.  Simplifying, we get 2x + 18 = 98.  Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us 2x = 80.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 40.  So Donovan's part took 40 minutes.  Therefore, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.  The answer is 58. 
 Betsy and Donovan's parts together take 98 minutes.  Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part.  This is like starting with Donovan's part (x) adding 18 minutes and then adding that to (x) again.  So it would be x + 18 + x = 98.  This simplifies to 2x + 18 = 98.  2x = 80.  x = 40.  So Donovan's part took 40 minutes.  Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.  The answer is 58.

3) Painkillers: 30 pills * 4 dollars per pill = 120 dollars. 
4) Parking: minimum 2 hours, so 2 hours * 6 dollars per hour = 12 dollars. 

The total is 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 dollars.  The answer is 482. 
 Hannah had to pay for the cast, the visit, painkillers, and parking. 

For the cast: 200 dollars. 

For the visit: 30 minutes is half an hour, so 0. 5 hours.  0. 5 * 300 is 150 dollars. 

For painkillers: 30 painkillers for 4 dollars each is 30 * 4 = 120 dollars. 

For parking: For a minimum of 2 hours, and at 6 dollars per hour, it costs 2 * 6 = 12 dollars. 

Adding all these costs up, 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 dollars.  The answer is 482. 
 Hannah will be charged 200 dollars for the cast.   300/hour for the doctor's visit is 300 x 0. 5 (30 minutes is half an hour) = 150 dollars.   She will have to pay 4 dollars for 30 painkillers, which is 4 x 30 = 120 dollars.   She will have to pay 6 dollars for a minimum of 2 hours parking, which is 6 x 2 = 12 dollars.   So the total bill is 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482 dollars.  The answer is 482. 
 Hannah had to pay $200 for the cast.  
The doctor's 30-minute visit is 30 minutes or 1/2 hour.  So the doctor charged her $300/2 = $150 for the visit.  
Hannah got 30 painkillers, and each costs $4, so the painkillers cost 30 x 4 = 120.  
Hannah had to park for a minimum of 2 hours, and each hour costs $6, so that will be 2 x 6 = 12 dollars.  
Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is 200 + 150 + 120 + 12 = 482.  The answer is 482. 
 Brian slipped on a banana peel and got hurt.  The doctor charges for the cast: $200.  The doctor charges $300 an hour, but only made an appointment for 30 minutes.

So that's 2 x $6 = $12.  $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.  The answer is 482.

80 emails a day x 5 days a week is 80 x 5 = 400 emails.  20% of 400 is 400 x 0. 2 = 80.  So, 80 emails don't require a response.  That means James has to respond to 400 - 80 = 320 emails.  The answer is 320. 
80 emails a day for 5 days is 80 * 5 = 400.  If 20% of those emails don't require responses, then 400 - 400 * 0. 20 = 320 emails require responses.  The answer is 320. 
80 emails per day is 80 x 5 = 400 emails in 5 days.  If 20% don't require response, then that is 20% of 400 which is 0. 2 x 400 = 80 emails that don't require response.  So the number of emails he needs to respond to is 400 - 80 = 320.  The answer is 320. 
80 emails a day for 5 days is a total of 80 * 5 = 400 emails.  20% of 400 emails don't require response.  20% of 400 is 20 / 100 * 400 = 80 emails.  He doesn't respond to these 80 emails.  So, he responds to the rest of the 400 emails.  400 - 80 = 320.  The answer is 320. 
80 emails come in a day, and 20% of those don't require response.  20% of 80 is 20/100 * 80 = 16.  That means 16 emails don't require response.  So he needs to respond to 80 - 16 = 64 emails per day.  For 5 days, he will respond to 5 x 64 = 320 emails.  The answer is 320.

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas, which is 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas.  They ate 80% of them, which is 40 * 0. 8 = 32 pizzas.  There are 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left for the football team. 

In total, there are 6 pizzas left for the glee club and 8 pizzas left for the football team.  There are 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left.  The answer is 14. 
20 pizzas were originally ordered.  The glee club ate 70% of 20, which is 0. 7 x 20 = 14.  The total pizzas left from the glee club is 20 - 14 = 6.  The football team ordered 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.  They ate 80% of them, which is 0. 8 x 40 = 32.  The total pizzas left from the football team is 40 - 32 = 8.  So in total, 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas are left.  The answer is 14. 
20 pizzas were originally ordered by the glee club.  They ate 70% of them, which is 20 * 0. 7 = 14 pizzas.  So 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas are left from the glee club.  The football team ordered twice as many pizzas, which is 20 * 2 = 40 pizzas.  They ate 80% of them, which is 40 * 0. 8 = 32 pizzas.  So there are 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left from the football team.  Since the answers are not combined, we need to add the remaining pizzas together.  6 + 8 = 14 pizzas.  The answer is 14. 
20 pizzas were originally ordered. 
The glee club ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them.  To find 70% of 20, multiply 20 by 0. 7.  20 * 0. 7 = 14.  So the glee club ate 14 pizzas. 
The glee club has 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left. 

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, which means they ordered 2 * 20 = 40 pizzas. 
They ate 80% of the pizzas.  To find 80% of 40, multiply 40 by 0. 8.  40 * 0. 8 = 32.  So the football team ate 32 pizzas. 
The football team has 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas left. 

In total, there are 6 pizzas from the glee club and 8 pizzas from the football team left.  6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left in total.

Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so the small coupons cost 5 cents x 700 = 3500 cents = 35 dollars. 

Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so the big coupons cost 15 cents x 1400 = 21,000 cents = 210 dollars. 

The total cost of postage is 35 dollars for small coupons and 210 dollars for big coupons.  35 + 210 = 245.  The answer is 245. 
 Anthony is sending 700 small coupons.  He is also sending twice as many big coupons.  So 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.  The total number of coupons he is sending is 700 + 1400 = 2100.  Each small coupon costs 5 cents, so the cost of mailing small coupons is 700 x 5 cents = 3500 cents or 35 dollars.  Each big coupon costs 15 cents, so the cost of mailing big coupons is 1400 x 15 cents = 21000 cents or 210 dollars.  The total cost of sending coupons is 35 dollars + 210 dollars = 245 dollars.  The answer is 245. 
 Anthony is sending out 700 small coupons.  Since he also wants to send out twice as many big coupons, he is sending out 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.

The cost of postage for big coupons is 15 cents each, so for 1400 big coupons, that is 1400 x 15 = 21000 cents = 210 dollars.  To find the total cost of postage, we add the costs together: 35 + 210 = 245 dollars.  The answer is 245. 
700 small coupons cost 5 cents each, so that is 700 x 5 cents = 3500 cents = 35 dollars.  He wants twice as many big coupons, so 2 x 700 = 1400 big coupons.  It costs 15 cents for each big coupon, so that is 1400 x 15 cents = 21000 cents = 210 dollars.  So Anthony needs to spend 35 + 210 = 245 dollars.  The answer is 245. 
 Anthony starts by sending out 700 small coupons.  The cost of mailing the small coupons will be 700 * 5 = 3500 cents.  3500 cents is 35 dollars. 

He also sends out twice as many big coupons, so that's 700 * 2 = 1400 big coupons.  The cost of mailing these big coupons is 1400 * 15 = 21000 cents.  21000 cents is 210 dollars. 

The total cost of mailing the coupons is 35 + 210 = 245 dollars.  The answer is 245. 
 There were 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons, which is 700 * 2 = 1400.  Total, there are 700 + 1400 = 2100 coupons to mail.  Each small coupon costs 5 cents and each big coupon costs 15 cents.  So the cost of total postage will be 700 * 0. 05 + 1400 * 0. 15.  700 * 0. 05 = 35 and 1400 * 0. 15 = 210.

[EXP] 669: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Sidney ordered 3 less than ten sandwiches, so she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches.  Then Mark ate 4 of them, so Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 left.  Sidney ordered 3 more sandwiches, so now she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 sandwiches.  Each sandwich has 4 meatballs, so in total Sidney has 6 x 4 = 24 meatballs left.  The answer is 24. 
 Sidney ordered 3 less than 10 sub sandwiches.  10 - 3 = 7.  So Sidney ordered 7 sub sandwiches.  Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs.  So the total number of meatballs in the original order was 7 x 4 = 28.  After Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, Sidney had 7 - 4 = 3 sub sandwiches left.  3 x 4 = 12.  Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, and after that Mark didn't eat any more, so the number of sub sandwiches remaining is 3 (original) + 3 (new) = 6.  Since each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, Sidney had 6 x 4 = 24 meatballs remaining.  The answer is 24. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, so she ordered 10 - 3 = 7 meatball sub sandwiches. 

In each sub sandwich, there are 4 meatballs.  So, Sidney's 7 sub sandwiches had 7 x 4 = 28 meatballs in total. 

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, so 4 x 4 = 16 meatballs were eaten. 

Sidney then ordered 3 more sub sandwiches, so she has 7 + 3 = 10 sub sandwiches now.  In each sub sandwich, there are still 4 meatballs, so that makes 10 x 4 = 40 meatballs. 

Hence, the number of meatballs remaining is 40 - 16 = 24. 

The answer is 24.

So 20 - 5 = 15 trucks managed to deliver the fertiliser.  Each truck had 20 tons, so the total tons delivered is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.  The answer is 300. 
 Mr Hezekiah started with 20 trucks.  A quarter of the number of trucks is 20 / 4 = 5 trucks that could not reach the farmers because they had mechanical failures.  So, 20 - 5 = 15 trucks made it to the farmers.  Each truck had 20 tons of fertiliser.  15 x 20 = 300 tons of fertiliser reached the farmers.  The answer is 300. 
20 trucks were dispatched for delivery.  Then, a quarter of them failed, which means $\frac{1}{4}$ or 5 trucks failed.  That's 20 - 5 = 15 trucks that actually delivered the fertiliser.  Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.  So the total number of tons of fertiliser delivered is 20 * 15 = 300.  The answer is 300. 
20 trucks were dispatched.  A quarter of the trucks experienced mechanical failures, which is the same as saying that 1/4 of the trucks experienced mechanical failures.  20 divided by 4 is 5.  So 5 trucks experienced mechanical failures.  The rest, 20 - 5 = 15, were able to deliver fertilizers to the farmers.  Each truck carried 20 tons.  So, 15 trucks carried a total of 15 x 20 = 300 tons. 

The answer is 300. 
20 trucks were dispatched, carrying 20 tons each.  So there were 20 * 20 = 400 tons of fertiliser.  Then, a quarter of the trucks (1/4) failed.  So, the number of failed trucks is 20 * 1/4 = 5 trucks.  If 5 trucks did not deliver, 20 - 5 = 15 trucks did deliver.  15 trucks had 20 tons each, so the total tons delivered is 15 * 20 = 300.

Her total number of guests is 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family) - 4 (no-shows) = 41 guests.  So she is 41 - 20 = 21 guests over the original party size.  The fee for each additional guest is $6.  So the fee for the extra guests will be 21 * 6 = 126.  Adding this to the base fee, the total cost is 125 + 126 = 251.  The answer is 251. 
 Kayla has to pay a base fee of $125 for 20 people.  Since she invited 25 classmates, 7 girls in her dance class, and 13 family members, but 4 people could not come, the actual number of guests is 25 + 7 + 13 - 4 = 41.  41 people exceeding the 20 people paid by $6 each.  So the additional fee is 41 - 20 = 21 people times $6 = 126.  The total cost is 126 + 125 = 251.  The answer is 251. 
 Let's break it down step by step. 
Kayla invited 25 classmates and 7 girls from her dance class, so she invited 25 + 7 = 32 classmates and dance girls.  Adding 13 family members, she invited 32 + 13 = 45 people total.  However, 4 people could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41. 

The base fee is $125 for 20 guests.  Since 41 guests came, we need to add $6 for each of the 21 extra guests (41 - 20). 

Cost for extra guests: 21 x $6 = $126
Base fee: $125
Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

Since Riza spent one-third of her money, she has 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left.  The total money left is 45 + 40 = 85.  The answer is 85. 
 Maggie and Riza both started with $60 each.  If Maggie spent a quarter of her money and Riza spent one-third of her money, then Maggie spent 1/4 * 60 = 15 dollars and Riza spent 1/3 * 60 = 20 dollars.  So they each had 60 - 15 = 45 and 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left respectively.  In total, they have 45 + 40 = 85 dollars left.  The answer is 85. 
 Maggie and Riza each started with 60 dollars.  
Maggie spent a quarter of her money.  So she spent 60 / 4 = 15 dollars.  
Riza spent one-third of her money.  So she spent 60 / 3 = 20 dollars. 
After spending, Maggie has 60 - 15 = 45 dollars left.  Riza has 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left.  In total, they have 45 + 40 = 85 dollars.  The answer is 85. 
 Let's start with Maggie.  She spent a quarter of her money, which means 1/4.  So if she had 60 dollars, she spent 60/4 = 15 dollars.  To find out how much she has left, subtract 15 from 60: 60 - 15 = 45.  

Let's do the same with Riza.  She spent one-third of her money, which means 1/3.  If she had 60 dollars, she spent 60/3 = 20 dollars.  To find out how much she has left, subtract 20 from 60: 60 - 20 = 40. 

Now let's add their remaining amounts: 45 + 40 = 85.  The answer is 85. 
 Maggie and Riza had 60 dollars each.  60 * 2 = 120, so together they had 120 dollars.  They each spent some of this money.  Maggie spent a quarter of her money, which is 60 / 4 = 15 dollars.  Riza spent one-third of her money, which is 60 / 3 = 20 dollars.  15 + 20 = 35.  So together they spent 35 dollars.  After this, they have 120 - 35 = 85 dollars left.  The answer is 85.

The second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so 14 bananas a day.  The third monkey eats the rest, 45 - 10 - 14 = 21 bananas a day.  The answer is 21. 
315 bananas is the total amount.  It feeds the monkeys for a week, so each day they eat (315 ÷ 7) bananas.  (315 ÷ 7) is 45 bananas.  The first monkey eats 10 bananas each day.  The second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so it eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas.  The remaining bananas for the day, which is 45 - (10 + 14) = 21 bananas.  The answer is 21. 
315 bananas are bought to feed the three monkeys for a week.  That's a total of 315 bananas / 7 days = 45 bananas for each day.  The first monkey eats 10 bananas per day, and the second monkey eats 4 more than the first monkey, which is 10 + 4 = 14 bananas per day.  The second monkey eats 14 bananas.  Now we know the first and second monkeys eat 10 and 14 bananas per day, respectively.  To get the total bananas eaten by the first two monkeys, we add 10 + 14 = 24 bananas per day.  This leaves 45 - 24 = 21 bananas for the third monkey per day.  The answer is 21.

1.  First, let's find the money from milkshakes.  6 milkshakes for 5. 50 each is 6 x 5. 50 = 33. 00. 

2.  Then, let's find the money from burger platters.  9 burger platters for 11 each is 9 x 11 = 99. 

3.  Then, let's find the money from sodas.  20 sodas for 1. 50 each is 20 x 1. 50 = 30. 

4.  To find the total amount, we add the money from milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas.  33 + 99 + 30 = 162. 

The answer is 162. 
 First, let's find the profit from milkshakes.  Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5. 50 each, so that is 6 x $5. 50 = $33. 00. 

Next, let's find the profit from burger platters.  Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so that is 9 x $11 = $99. 

Next, let's find the profit from sodas.  Terry sells 20 sodas for $1. 50 each, so that is 20 x $1. 50 = $30. 

In total, Terry makes $33. 00 + $99 + $30 = $162. 00.  The answer is 162.

The second train will arrive 30 minutes from the first train's arrival and will stay for 20/4 = 5 minutes.  The third train will arrive 60 minutes from the second train's arrival and will leave immediately after its arrival.  The 4th train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station.  10 + 30 + 30 + 20 is 90.  The answer is 90. 
 Let's break it down:

First train: arrives in 10 minutes, stays in the station for 20 minutes, leaves the station after 30 minutes. 

Second train: arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, which is 60 minutes after it starts.  It stays in the station for half of the time the first train stayed, which is 10 minutes.  Total time for the second train is 60 minutes. 

Third train: arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is 70 minutes after the first train started.  It stays in the station for 0 minutes, since it leaves immediately after arrival. 

Fourth train: arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is 90 minutes after the first train started.  This is the train Paul will board. 

Paul will wait a total of 90 minutes for his train.  The answer is 90.

[EXP] 679: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie has been saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.  So she has saved 12 x 10 = 120 toothpicks.  Since she needs 200 toothpicks total, she still needs 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks.  If she continues saving 10 toothpicks each week, it will take her 80 / 10 = 8 weeks to collect the remaining toothpicks.  The answer is 8. 
 Melanie had 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks, so she collected 12 * 10 = 120 toothpicks.  She needs 200 toothpicks.  To find out how many more weeks it will take, subtract the number of toothpicks she has from the number of toothpicks she needs: 200 - 120 = 80.  80 toothpicks is 80 / 10 = 8 weeks of savings.  The answer is 8. 
 Melane started saving 10 toothpicks each week for 12 weeks.  So in 12 weeks she saved 12 x 10 = 120 toothpicks.  She still needs to save 200 toothpicks.  200 - 120 = 80 more toothpicks.  She saves 10 toothpicks per week.  So she needs to save 80 / 10 = 8 more weeks.  The answer is 8.

[EXP] 680: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Mr.  Rogers paid 75% of the original price, so he paid 0. 75 x $2000 = $1500.  He then sold it to his friend at 120% of that price, so $1500 x 1. 2 = $1800.  The original price is $2000.  The discount is $2000 - $1800 = $200.  The discount as a percentage is (200/2000) x 100% = 10%.  The answer is 10%. 
75% of the original price is 2000 * 0. 75 = 1500.  Mr.  Rogers bought the watch for 1500 dollars.  After buying it, he sold it to his friend for 120% of that, which is 1500 * 1. 2 = 1800.  To find the discount, we need to find the difference between the original price and the price Mr.  Rogers' friend paid.  2000 - 1800 is 200.  To find the percentage, we divide the discount by the original price: 200 / 2000 = 0. 10 = 10%.  The answer is 10. 
 Firstly, we will find the original price that Mr.  Rogers paid for the watch.  75% of 2000 is 0. 75 * 2000 = 1500.  Now, Mr.  Rogers sold the watch to his friend at 120% of this price.  120% of 1500 is 1. 20 * 1500 = 1800.  Mr.  Rogers' friend paid $1800 for the watch.  Therefore, the original price of the watch is the original price minus the amount Mr.  Rogers paid.  So, the original price minus 1800 is 2000 - 1800 = 200.  But Mr.  Roger's friend does not pay the original price.  They pay 1800 dollars at 120% of the price that Mr.  Rogers paid.  The amount that Mr.  Roger's friend paid is 1800 compared to the original price of 2000.  So, Mr.  Roger's friend is getting a discount of 2000 - 1800 = 200.  The discount percentage is then 200 / 2000 * 100 = 10.  The answer is 10.

 Frankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's, which is 2 x 90 + 15.  2 x 90 + 15 = 180 + 15 = 195.  The answer is 195. 
 Frankie's score is 15 more than twice Binkie's score.  If Binkie's score is 90, then twice her score would be 2 x 90 = 180.  180 plus 15 is 195.  The answer is 195. 
 Frankie's score was 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's.  So 2 times Binkie's score, which is 2 x 90 = 180.  180 + 15 = 195.  The answer is 195. 
 Frankie's score is 15 better than twice as high as Binkie's.  Since Binkie got a score of 90, we need to calculate twice Binkie's score: 2 x 90 = 180.  Frankie's score is 15 better than that, so Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.  The answer is 195. 
 Let's start by identifying the information the problem gives us: Frankie's score was 15 points more than twice Binkie's score.  We know Binkie scored 90, so twice her score is 2 x 90 = 180.  Then Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.  The answer is 195.

If she buys the bananas in bunches, the total cost would be 10 x 3 = 30 dollars.  So she saved 32 - 30 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
10 bunches with 4 bananas each means Jenny bought 10 x 4 = 40 bananas total. 

Buying 40 bananas individually would have cost 40 * 0. 80 = 32. 00. 

Buying 10 bunches for 3. 00 each means Jenny spent 10 x 3 = 30. 00. 

Jenny saved 32. 00 - 30. 00 = 2. 00 by buying the bananas in bunches. 

The answer is 2. 
 Jenny bought 10 bunches for $3. 00 each.  That's a total of 10 x 3 = 30 dollars.  She could have bought the bananas individually.  She bought 10 bunches, so that is 10 x 4 = 40 bananas.  Each banana costs 0. 80, so 0. 80 x 40 = 32. 00.  She could have spent 32. 00 at first, but she only spent 30. 00.  So she saved 32. 00 - 30. 00 = 2. 00.  The answer is 2. 00.

[EXP] 685: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 100 feet of fence total.  Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam.  So Sam gets (100 - 60) / 2 = 20 feet.  Harry gets 60 feet, so Sam gets 20 feet.  The answer is 20. 
100 feet need to be divided between the two in some proportion.  Harry gets 60 more feet than Sam, so let's call the amount of feet Sam receives x.  Then Harry will get x + 60. 

The total amount of feet divided is 100, so x + (x + 60) = 100.  We can simplify this to 2x + 60 = 100.  To find x, we subtract 60 from both sides: 2x = 40.  Then we divide by 2: x = 20. 

So Sam gets 20 feet and Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80.  The difference between 80 and 100 is 20, so 20 feet are left over for Sam.  The answer is 20.

8 inches per 4 years means the crocodile grows at a rate of 8/4 = 2 inches per year. 

So, in 13 years, the crocodile will grow 2 inches per year multiplied by 13 years = 2 x 13 = 26 inches. 

The answer is 26 inches. 
 The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.  
To find its rate of growth, we can divide 8 by 4.  8/4 = 2.  
The crocodile grows 2 inches per year.  
In 13 years, the crocodile will grow 2 x 13 = 26 inches.  The answer is 26. 
 The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.  We can calculate the rate it grows per year by dividing 8 by 4.  8 ÷ 4 = 2.  So, the crocodile grows 2 inches per year.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child, so the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. 

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. 

And the fourth child is three inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall. 

The answer is 72 inches. 
 Caroline's first child is 6 feet, which is 6 x 12 = 72 inches.  

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so it is 74 inches. 

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so it is 74 - 5 = 69 inches. 

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so it is 69 + 3 = 72 inches. 

The answer is 72. 
 Let's convert the heights of the children to inches: 

1st child: 6 feet = 6 x 12 inches = 72 inches 

2nd child: 2 inches taller than the 1st child = 72 + 2 = 74 inches 

3rd child: 5 inches shorter than the 2nd child = 74 - 5 = 69 inches 

4th child: 3 inches taller than the 3rd child = 69 + 3 = 72 inches 

The answer is 72. 
 Let's start with the measurements given:

* The first child is 6 feet tall, which is equal to 6 x 12 = 72 inches. 
* The second child is 2 inches taller than the first, so he/she is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. 
* The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second, so he/she is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. 
* The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third, so he/she is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall. 

The answer is 72 inches. 
 Let's start with the first child, who is 6 feet tall.  Since we're measured in inches, we need to convert the height from feet to inches.  There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so the first child is 6 * 12 = 72 inches tall. 

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, which means the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. 

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, which means the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. 

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, which means the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall. 

The answer is 72 inches. 
 First, we find the height of the second child.  The first child is 6 feet tall, and there are 12 inches in a foot, so the first child is 6 x 12 = 72 inches tall.  The second child is 2 inches taller, so it is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. 

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so it is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. 

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so it is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall. 

Since inches are typically written without feet, we can write this as 72 inches.  The answer is 72. 
 Let's start by converting the heights of the first three children to inches: 

The first child is 6 feet tall, which is 72 inches (6 * 12). 

The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so he is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall. 

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so he is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall. 

The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so he is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall. 

But that's in feet, not inches.  We need to convert the height of the fourth child to feet before we can compare it to the others.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so:

72 inches / 12 = 6 feet

The fourth child is 6 feet tall, which is the same as the first child.  The answer is 72 inches.

2000 apples is 2000 / 10 = 200 bags.  Selling 200 bags at 5 dollars each, the orchard earned 200 x 5 = 1000 dollars.  The answer is 1000. 
 The orchard sold apples in bags of 10, so the number of bags sold is 2000 ÷ 10 = 200.  Each bag costs $5, so the total earnings are 200 x 5 = 1000.  The answer is 1000. 
2000 apples divided into bags of 10 is 2000 / 10 = 200.  They sold 200 bags.  Each bag costs 5 dollars.  So 200 * 5 = 1000.  The answer is 1000. 
1 bag has 10 apples.  1 bag costs $5.  You could buy apples in lots of 10.  So the orchard sells bags of 10 apples.  They sold 2000 apples.  To find how many bags they sold, divide 2000 by 10, which is 200.  So they sold 200 bags.  Each bag is 5 dollars, so the total is 200 * 5 = 1000 dollars.  The answer is 1000.

South wall: 10 * 8 = 80 square feet
East wall: 5 * 8 = 40 square feet
West wall: 5 * 8 = 40 square feet
Total square feet to be painted: 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet

2.  Calculate the number of gallons of paint needed:
Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we divide the total square feet to be painted by 20:
240 / 20 = 12 gallons

3.  Calculate the total cost of paint:
Since each gallon costs $12, we multiply the number of gallons by the cost:
12 gallons * $12 per gallon = $144

The answer is 144. 
4 walls, with dimensions given as follows:
- North and south walls: 10 x 8 feet = 80 sq ft each
- East and west walls: 5 x 8 feet = 40 sq ft each

So the total area to be painted is: 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 sq ft

A gallon of paint can cover 20 sq ft, so we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.  Each gallon costs $12, so the total cost will be 12 x 12 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 Firstly, we can calculate the area of the walls.  The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet each, so they are each 80 square feet.  The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet each, so they are each 40 square feet.  The total area of the walls is 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet.  Since each gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, Tony will need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.  Since each gallon of paint costs 12 dollars, Tony will need 12 x 12 dollars to paint the room.  12 x 12 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
 Let's start by finding the total area of the walls.  The north and south walls are 10 x 8 = 80 square feet each, so together they are 80 x 2 = 160 square feet.  The east and west walls are 5 x 8 = 40 square feet each, so together they are 40 x 2 = 80 square feet.  Together, all four walls are 160 + 80 = 240 square feet. 

Now, we need to find how many gallons of paint are needed to cover the room.  Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, we can divide the total area by 20 to find out how many gallons are needed:

240 square feet ÷ 20 square feet per gallon = 12 gallons

Since each gallon costs $12, we can multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon to find the total cost:

12 gallons × $12 per gallon = $144

The answer is 144. 
1st, let's find the total area of the room.  North and south walls are 10 x 8 feet so they are 10 * 8 = 80 sq ft each.  There are 2 of them so 2 * 80 = 160 sq ft.  East and west walls are 5 x 8 feet so they are 5 * 8 = 40 sq ft each.  There are 2 of them so 2 * 40 = 80 sq ft.  The total area to be painted is 160 + 80 = 240 sq ft.  We can cover 20 sq ft with 1 gallon of paint.  We need to cover 240 sq ft so we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons.  Since it costs $12 per gallon, we can find the total cost: 12 * 12 = 144.

The first train is traveling 60 miles per hour, so it will travel 60 * 3 = 180 miles in 3 hours.  The second train is traveling half that distance per hour, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.  In 3 hours, it will travel 30 * 3 = 90 miles. 

Now, we add the distances traveled by each train to find the total distance between them: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.  The answer is 270. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour.  This means that in 3 hours, it will have traveled 60 * 3 = 180 miles. 

The second train is traveling half that distance per hour, which is 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.  In 3 hours, it will have traveled 30 * 3 = 90 miles. 

To find the distance between them, we add the distances traveled by each train: 180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles. 

So, after 3 hours, the two trains are 270 miles apart.  The answer is 270. 
 Let's find the speed of the second train.  Since it's traveling half the distance of the first train, which is 60 miles per hour, the second train is traveling 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.  In 3 hours, the first train will travel 3 * 60 = 180 miles.  The second train will travel 3 * 30 = 90 miles.  To find the distance between them, add the distance each train traveled: 180 + 90 = 270 miles.  The answer is 270. 
 Let's break this down:

The first train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, so in 3 hours, it will have covered a distance of:
60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

The second train is traveling half that distance per hour, which is 30 miles per hour.  In 3 hours, it will have covered a distance of:
30 miles/hour × 3 hours = 90 miles

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add the distances they have traveled to find the total distance between them:
180 miles + 90 miles = 270 miles

The answer is 270. 
 Trains are traveling away from each other.  Train A travels at 60 miles per hour and train B travels at half of that, which is 30 miles per hour.  In 3 hours, train A will travel 3 * 60 = 180 miles and train B will travel 3 * 30 = 90 miles.  So they will be 180 + 90 = 270 miles apart.  The answer is 270. 
60 miles per hour is how fast the first train is going.  The second train is traveling half that distance per hour, which means it is traveling 30 miles per hour.  In one hour, the first train will have gone 60 miles and the second train will have gone 30 miles.  In three hours, the first train will have gone 3 x 60 = 180 miles and the second train will have gone 3 x 30 = 90 miles.  Together they are 180 + 90 = 270 miles apart.  The answer is 270.

[EXP] 697: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Billy volunteers on all days except the 20% of days that he takes off.  20% of 31 days is 0. 2 * 31 = 6. 25 days, but you can't volunteer on a fraction of a day, so it's 6 days.  He volunteers the remaining 31 - 6 = 25 days.  Each day he helps 2 people for 3 hours, so that's 2 people per hour * 3 hours per day = 6 people per day.  6 people per day * 25 days = 150 people.  The answer is 150. 
 Let's first calculate the total number of days Billy helps:

March has 31 days, and he takes 20% of those off, so he takes off 20% x 31 = 6. 2 days.  We round it to 6 days. 

For the remaining days, 31 - 6 = 25 days, Billy helps people. 

For each day, he helps 2 people per hour for 3 hours, which is 2 * 3 = 6 people per day. 

So, in 25 days, he helps 6 people per day * 25 days = 150 people. 
The answer is 150.

[EXP] 698: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 480, [output]: 20 cars carried 20 x 3 = 60 people.  12 buses carried 12 x 35 = 420 people.  The total people inside the church is 60 + 420 = 480.  The answer is 480. 
 There are 20 cars and 12 buses outside the church.  Cars held 20 * 3 = 60 people and buses held 12 * 35 = 420 people.  60 + 420 = 480 people.  The answer is 480. 
 There are originally 20 private cars and 12 buses.  So there are 20 + 12 = 32 vehicles.  Each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people.  So in total, 12 buses x 35 people = 420 people and 20 cars x 3 people = 60 people.  420 + 60 is 480 people.  The answer is 480. 
20 cars were parked outside the church, and 12 buses.  So originally, there were 20 * 3 = 60 people in the cars and 12 * 35 = 420 people in the buses.  In total, 60 + 420 = 480 people were parked outside the church.  The answer is 480. 
20 cars and 12 buses were parked outside the church.  Let's find out how many people were inside the church. 

First, let's find the number of people in cars.  Each car has 3 people, and there are 20 cars.  So, the total number of people in cars is:

20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Next, let's find the number of people in buses.  Each bus has 35 people, and there are 12 buses.  So, the total number of people in buses is:

12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Now, add the number of people in cars and buses to get the total number of people inside the church:

60 people (in cars) + 420 people (in buses) = 480 people

The answer is 480.

[EXP] 699: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  We can start by using the information that Mike is 24 years old.  Martha is 4 years younger than Mike, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.  Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.  The answer is 30. 
 If Mike is 24, Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.  Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so he is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.  The answer is 30. 
 Let's start by finding Martha's age.  Since Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger, Martha's age is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.  Since Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Let's start with what we know: Mike is 24 years old.  Martha is 4 years younger, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.  Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff's age is 20 + 10 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
1) Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.  Mike is 24 years old, so Martha is 24 - 4 = 20 years old.  2) Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.  Since Martha is 20 years old, Jeff is 20 + 10 = 30 years old.  The answer is 30.

[EXP] 700: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 300 ft / 60 ft/min = 5 minutes (time to ride the big slide).  240 ft / 80 ft/min = 3 minutes (time to ride the second slide).  5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
1.  Find out how long it takes to slide down the first slide:

300 ft / 60 ft/min = 5 min

2.  Find out how long it takes to slide down the second slide:

240 ft / 80 ft/min = 3 min

3.  Compare the time it takes for both slides:

5 min - 3 min = 2 min

The answer is 2 minutes. 
 The biggest slide is 300 feet long, and you go 60 feet per minute.  So how many minutes does it take? 300 divided by 60 is 5 minutes.  The second slide is 240 feet long, and you go 80 feet per minute.  240 divided by 80 is 3 minutes.  To ride the biggest slide, it takes 5 minutes.  To ride the second slide, it takes 3 minutes.  The difference is 5 - 3 = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
 The biggest waterslide is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute.  To get the time it takes to ride this waterslide, we divide the length by the speed: 300 / 60 = 5 minutes.  The second biggest waterslide is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute.  To get the time it takes to ride this waterslide, we divide the length by the speed: 240 / 80 = 3 minutes.  Now we compare the time: 5 minutes on the first slide minus 3 minutes on the second slide = 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
 Let's break this problem down.  The biggest slide is 300 feet long and the slide speed is 60 feet/minute.  So, it would take 300/60 = 5 minutes to ride the biggest slide. 

The second biggest slide is 240 feet long, but slide down speed is 80 feet/minute.  So, it would take 240/80 = 3 minutes to ride the second biggest slide. 

The difference in time between the two slides will be 5 minutes (biggest slide) - 3 minutes (second biggest slide) = 2 minutes. 

The answer is 2. 
 Barry is working at the amusement park, where people ride the big waterslides.  He is curious about how long it takes to ride the different slides.  He calculations in his head:  If you slide down the long slide at 60 feet/minute, it will take you 300/60 minutes to slide the whole thing.  That's 5 minutes.  If you slide down the shorter slide at 80 feet/minute, it will take you 240/80 minutes.  That's 3 minutes.  5 - 3 = 2.  The answer is 2.

[EXP] 701: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 30 minutes is half an hour.  2 * 15 minutes is 30 minutes.  So Bobby takes 30 + 30 minutes of breaks per day.  That is 1 hour.  For 5 days, it is 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
30 minutes (lunch) + 2 * 15 minutes (breaks) = 30 + 30 = 60 minutes.  So per day, his lunches and breaks add up to 1 hour. 

In 5 days, his lunches and breaks will add up to 1 * 5 = 5 hours. 

The answer is 5. 
30 minutes is 1/2 hour.  So Bobby's lunch is 0. 5 hours.  Each break is 15 minutes, which is 1/4 hour.  So 2 breaks are 2/4 hours.  In a day, the total time is 0. 5 + 2/4 = 1 hour.  For 5 days, it will be 5 x 1 hour = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
30 minutes for lunch is half an hour.  Bobby has 2 15-minute breaks per day.  That's 15 + 15 = 30 minutes, or another half hour.  So in total, Bobby takes 1 hour, or 60 minutes, per day for lunch and breaks.  After 5 days, 60 * 5 = 300 minutes.  To convert minutes to hours, divide by 60.  300 / 60 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5 hours. 
30 minutes is half an hour, and 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour.  2 15-minute breaks is 2 x 0. 25 = 0. 5 hours.  This means he takes 0. 5 hour of breaks.  He also takes a 0. 5 hour lunch, so in total he takes 0. 5 + 0. 5 = 1 hour of break and lunch.  For 5 days, he takes 5 x 1 = 5 hours of break and lunch.  The answer is 5. 
30 minutes is half an hour.  Adding 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes.  So, Bobby takes 1 hour (30 minutes + 30 minutes) per day.  In total, that's 1 hour per day for 5 days.  1 x 5 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 

Note: I followed the same format as the previous examples to solve the problem. 
 Bobby's lunch is 30 minutes or 0. 5 hours per day.   His break is 2 x 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 0. 5 hours per day.  So twice a day, Bobby has 0. 5 + 0. 5 = 1 hour of breaks.  After 5 days, 5 x 1 = 5.  0. 5 + 5 = 5. 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 5 hours. 
30 minutes for lunch, and 2 x 15 = 30 minutes for breaks.  So every day Bobby's breaks and lunches are 30 + 30 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour. 

Now we need to calculate how many hours his breaks and lunches add up to in 5 days.  1 hour each day, 5 days.  So, 1 * 5 = 5.  The answer is 5.

 Amber ran 8 miles.  Micah ran 3. 5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3. 5 * 8 = 28 miles.  Then, Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran 52 miles in total.  So Ahito ran 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
52 miles were run in total.  Amber ran 8 miles.  If Micah ran 3. 5 times what Amber ran, then Micah ran 3. 5 x 8 = 28 miles.  So Amber + Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.  Ahito must have run 52 - 36 = 16 miles.  The answer is 16. 
 We know that Amber ran 8 miles.  Micah ran 3. 5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 8 x 3. 5 = 28 miles.  8 + 28 is 36, so Amber and Micah ran 36 miles.  Therefore, Ahito must have run 52 - 36 = 16 miles.  The answer is 16. 
 Amber ran 8 miles.  Micah ran 3. 5 times what Amber ran, so Micah ran 3. 5 x 8 = 28 miles.  Since we know the total miles ran is 52, that leaves 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
 Let's start by using what we know.  Amber ran 8 miles.  Micah ran 3. 5 times what Amber ran.  So we can say Micah ran 3. 5 x 8 = 28 miles (because 3. 5 times 8 is 28).  So far, Amber and Micah ran 8 + 28 = 36 miles.  This means Ahito ran 52 - 36 = 16 miles.  The answer is 16.

Then she purchased a frying pan for 20% off $20. 00, which means she paid 80% of $20. 00 = $16. 00 for the frying pan.  She added this to her balance, so her new balance is $70. 00 + $16. 00 = $86. 00. 

Next, she bought a set of towels for 10% off $30. 00, which means she paid 90% of $30. 00 = $27. 00 for the towels.  She added this to her balance, so her new balance is $86. 00 + $27. 00 = $113. 00. 

The answer is 113. 
 Sheila started with 85 dollars worth of merchandise.  After returning one item worth 15 dollars, her balance is 85 - 15 = 70 dollars. 

She bought a frying pan worth 20 dollars, but it was 20% off.  20% of 20 dollars is 20 x 0. 2 = 4 dollars.  So the cost of the pan was 20 - 4 = 16 dollars.  She also bought a set of towels worth 30 dollars, but it was 10% off.  10% of 30 dollars is 30 x 0. 1 = 3 dollars.  So the cost of the towels was 30 - 3 = 27 dollars. 

The total amount she spent is 16 + 27 = 43 dollars.  She put this amount on her credit card.  So her new balance is 70 + 43 = 113 dollars.  The answer is 113. 
 Sheila started with 85 dollars.  Then she returned 15 dollars worth of merchandise.  So the new balance is 85 - 15 = 70.  Then she bought a frying pan for 20% off of 20 dollars.  The discount is 20% of 20, which is 4 dollars.  So she paid 20 - 4 = 16 dollars for the frying pan.  Also, she bought a set of towels that is 10% off of 30 dollars.  The discount is 10% of 30, which is 3 dollars.  So she paid 30 - 3 = 27 dollars for the towels.  The total amount she charged on her credit card is 16 + 27 dollars.  16 + 27 is 43 dollars.  So the new balance on her credit card is 70 + 43 = 113 dollars.  The answer is 113. 
 Sheila started with $85. 00 on her credit card.  After returning an item that cost $15. 00, her new balance will be 85. 00 - 15. 00 = 70. 00.  

Then, she bought a frying pan that was 20% off $20. 00.  20% off means 80% of the total price remains.  So the price of the frying pan is 0. 8 * 20 = 16. 00.  With tax, the price of the frying pan is 16. 00.  This will add 16. 00 to her credit card balance.  

Then, she bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30. 00.  10% of the price is removed, so 90% of the price remains.  0. 9 * 30 = 27. 00, so the price of the towels is 27. 00.  With tax, the price of the towels is 27. 00.  This will also add 27. 00 to her credit card balance. 

In total, her new balance is 70. 00 + 16. 00 + 27. 00 = 113. 00.  The answer is 113. 00.

So the number of large jellyfish that changed color is 6 x 3 = 18.  A fifth of these jellyfish are large, so there are 18 x 5 = 90 jellyfish originally.  The answer is 90. 
 The problem states that a fifth of the jellyfish are large.  The problem also states that a third of the large jellyfish change color.  The number of jellyfish that change color is 6.  So, 6 is a third of the large jellyfish.  6 * 3 = 18, so there are 18 large jellyfish.  Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the total number of jellyfish is 18 * 5 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
 A fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color.  So, let the number of large jellyfish be x.  Then, the number of jellyfish that change color is x / 3. 

The problem says that 6 jellyfish changed color, so x/3 = 6.  Solving for x, we get x = 18. 

Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the total number of jellyfish is 5x = 90.

So Lauren needs to save 400,000.  Now we need to find out how many years it will take to save this.  Let x be the number of years.  Then 20,000 * x = 400,000.  So, x = 400,000 / 20,000 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
20% of $100,000 is $20,000 per year.  For 20 years, she will have saved 20 years x 20,000 = 400,000 dollars.  After retirement, she will live on 40% of $100,000, which is $40,000 per year.  So she needs to save 20 years x $40,000 = 800,000 dollars.  She only has 400,000 dollars so far, so she needs to save an additional 800,000 - 400,000 = 400,000 dollars.  If she saves 20,000 per year, she will take 400,000 / 20,000 = 20 more years to reach her goal.  The answer is 20. 
 First, calculate how much Lauren will save each year.  20% of 100,000 is 0. 20 * 100,000 = 20,000 dollars per year.  That means she plans to save 20,000 dollars per year.  If she needs 20 years worth of savings, that's 20,000 * 20 = 400,000 dollars total.  She'll need to work for 400,000 / 20,000 more years to reach her goal.  400,000 / 20,000 is 20 more years.

100 centimeters of ribbon must be divided into 4 equal parts.  100 / 4 = 25.  So each part is 25 centimeters long.  Then each of these 25-centimeter parts must be divided into 5 equal parts.  Since each part is 25 centimeters long, each of these smaller parts will be 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long.  The answer is 5. 
100 centimeters of ribbon must be cut into 4 equal parts.  So, each initial cut will be 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters long. 

Then, each of these parts must be cut into 5 equal parts.  So, each of these smaller parts will be 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long.  The answer is 5. 
100 centimeters of ribbon must be cut into 4 equal parts.  To do that, we need to divide 100 by 4, which gives us 25.  So each of the 4 parts will have a length of 25 centimeters. 

Each of these parts must be divided into 5 equal parts.  Since each part is 25 centimeters long, we need to divide 25 by 5 to get the length of each final cut.  25 divided by 5 is 5.  So each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.  The answer is 5. 
 Firstly, we need to find how many total pieces of ribbon Marty will have after cutting the ribbon into 4 equal parts.  He started with 100 centimeters of ribbon and cut it into 4 equal parts, so each part is 100 divided by 4 = 25 centimeters long.  Then, he needs to cut each part into 5 equal parts.  To find the length of each cut part, we divide 25 by 5 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
100 cm is the original ribbon.  It must be cut into 4 equal parts first.  To do that, we have to divide 100 by 4: 100 / 4 = 25 cm.  So each of the 4 parts initially is 25 cm.  These 4 parts will then be divided into 5 equal parts.  To find the length of each final part, we divide 25 cm by 5: 25 / 5 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
 1.  Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon.   He must cut it into 4 equal parts.   100 / 4 = 25.  Each part is 25 centimeters long. 

    2.  Each of these parts will be divided into 5 equal parts.  To find the length of each of the final cuts, divide the original part of 25 centimeters by 5. 

    25 divided by 5 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
100 centimeters are the original ribbon length.  Marty must cut them into 4 equal parts.  To do this, he divides the original length by 4.  100 / 4 = 25.  So, each part will have 25 centimeters length. 

Each of these parts must then be divided into 5 equal parts.  So, the 25 centimeters must now be divided by 5.  25 / 5 = 5.  Each of these parts will be 5 centimeters long.  The answer is 5.

x = 600

So the total population of the school is 600.  To find the number of girls, we can subtract the number of boys from the total population:

Number of girls = Total population - Number of boys
= 600 - 240
= 360

The answer is 360. 
40% of the school population is 240 boys.  So, the total population is 240/0. 4 = 600.  Since the population is 600, the number of girls is 600 - 240 = 360. 

The answer is 360. 
40% of the population is made of 240 boys.  This means that the total population is 240 / 40 = 6.  Since the total population is made up of 240 boys, the remaining 100% - 40% = 60% must be girls.  60% * total population = girls.  6 * 60 = 360.  The answer is 360. 
40% of the school population is 240 boys.  So 100% is 240 / 40 * 100 = 600.  The school has 600 students.  Let's say the number of girls is x.  The total number of people in the school is 600.  The total number of boys is 240.  The total number of girls is x.  Then 600 = 240 + x.  After subtracting 240 on both sides, 360 = x.  The answer is 360. 
40% of the school is made up of 240 boys.  In order to get the total number of students in the school, we need to find 100% of the school.  To do this, we can divide 240 by 40% (or 0. 4).  240 ÷ 0. 4 = 600 students.  Since 40% of the school is boys, 100% will be 600 / 1 = 600 students.  So the total school population is 600 students. 

Let's find the percentage of girls by subtracting the percentage of boys from 100%.  100 - 40 = 60%.  So 60% of the school is girls.  To find the number of girls, multiply the total number of students by this percentage.  600 x 0. 6 = 360.  The answer is 360.

3 red balls at 9 dollars each is 3 x 9 = 27 dollars.  11 blue balls at 5 dollars each is 11 x 5 = 55 dollars.  25 green balls at 3 dollars each is 25 x 3 = 75 dollars.  The store will receive a total of 27 + 55 + 75 dollars after all balls are sold.  The answer is 157. 
 There are 3 red balls initially.  If they all sell, they will all cost 3 x 9 = 27 dollars.  There are 11 blue balls.  They will all cost 11 x 5 = 55 dollars.  There are 25 green balls.  They will all cost 25 x 3 = 75 dollars.  27 + 55 + 75 = 157.  The answer is 157. 
3 + 11 + 25 = 39 balls in total.  

First, let's find the total value of green balls: 25 * $3 = $75

Next, let's find the total value of blue balls: 11 * $5 = $55

Then, let's find the total value of red balls: 3 * $9 = $27

Now, we add the values of all the balls: $75 + $55 + $27 = $157

So, the store will have received $157.  The answer is 157. 
3 + 11 + 25 = 39 balls in the store.  The store will receive 39 x dollars.  
The prices are: 
- 3 red balls x 9 = 27 
- 11 blue balls x 5 = 55

[EXP] 716: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Anna started with 16 dollars.  She spent 4 dollars already, so that leaves her with 16 - 4 = 12 dollars.  After buying 2 books, she had 2 dollars left.  So she spent 12 - 2 = 10 dollars on the 2 books.  The cost of each book is 10/2 = 5 dollars.  The answer is 5. 
 Anna started with a budget of $16, but spent $4 already, leaving her with 16 - 4 = 12 dollars.  After buying 2 books, she has 2 dollars left.  So the cost of 2 books is 12 - 2 = 10.  Since both books cost the same amount, we can divide 10 by 2 to find the cost of 1 book: 10 / 2 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
 Anna started with a budget of 16 dollars.  She spent 4 dollars.  16 - 4 is 12.  After buying the books, Anna had 2 dollars left.  So 12 - 2 is 10.  She spent 10 dollars on 2 books.  To find the cost of one book, we can divide 10 by 2.  10 divided by 2 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
 Anna started with a budget of 16 dollars.  She has already spent 4 dollars.  So she has 16 - 4 = 12 dollars left.  However, she has 2 dollars left after buying 2 books, so she spent 12 - 2 = 10 dollars on the books.  Each book cost the same amount, so they will split 10 dollars between them.  10 divided by 2 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
 Let's start by finding the amount of money Anna had left in her budget.  She had 16 dollars to start with, and she spent 4 dollars, so she has 16 - 4 = 12 dollars left.  Then, she bought 2 books and had 2 dollars left, so she must have spent 12 - 2 = 10 dollars on the books. 

Since the 2 books cost the same amount, they must have cost 10/2 = 5 dollars each. 

The answer is 5. 
16 dollars is Anna's budget, but she has already spent 4 dollars.  So she has 16 - 4 = 12 dollars left.  Now she has 2 dollars left, so she must have spent 12 - 2 = 10 dollars buying books.  She bought 2 books, which cost the same amount of money.  So we can let x be the cost of each book.  Then 10 = 2x.  So we can divide both sides by 2 to get 10/2 = x.  5 = x.  The answer is 5 dollars.

50 students were enrolled in the class last year.  This year, the enrollment increased by 20%.  To find the increase, multiply 50 by 0. 20, which is 10.  10 is the increase in enrollment.  To find the total enrollment this year, add the increase to the original enrollment: 50 + 10 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
50 students were originally enrolled.  A 20% increase means that there were 20% more students this year.  20% of 50 is 0. 2 * 50 = 10.  So the increase in students was 10 students.  50 + 10 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
50 students were enrolled last year.  A 20% increase means we need to multiply the original number by 1. 2 because 20% is the same as 0. 2, which is 1/5, so 1 + 1/5 = 6/5 = 1. 2.  50 * 1. 2 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
50 students were enrolled in the class last year.  This year there was a 20% increase.  A 20% increase is the same as an additional 20/100 of the total students.  20/100 = 0. 2.  So 50 + 0. 2*50 = 60 students are enrolled this year.  The answer is 60. 
 There were originally 50 students in the calligraphy class.  There was a 20% increase, so let's first convert the increase to a decimal: 20% = 0. 2.  Now, multiply the original number of students by the increase: 50 * 0. 2 = 10.  So, there were 10 more students enrolled this year.  The new total is the original number of students plus the increase: 50 + 10 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
 Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.  If there was a 20% increase, that means the number of students increased by 20% of 50. 

To find 20% of 50, convert the percentage to a decimal (20/100 = 0. 20) and multiply it by 50:

50 * 0. 20 = 10

So the number of students increased by 10.  To find the new total, add the 10 to the original number of students:

50 + 10 = 60

So, this year, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.  The answer is 60.

To find out how long it will take the light to blink 459 times, we divide 459 by 51, which is 459 ÷ 51 = 9.  So it will take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.  The answer is 9. 
255 blinks in 5 minutes, so for 1 minute, it blinks 255/5 = 51 times.  Since 459 blinks are needed, it will take 459/51 minutes.  459/51 is 9.  So it will take 9 minutes.  The answer is 9. 
255 light blinks in 5 minutes.  If it blinks 459 times, it will take more time.  459/255 = 1. 8118 x 5 minutes = 9. 06 minutes.  The answer is 9. 06 minutes. 
 The light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes.  So, it blinks 255/5 times per minute.  To find how many times it blinks in 1 minute, we can divide 255 by 5, which gives us 51.  It blinks 51 times per minute. 

To find how long it takes the light to blink 459 times, we need to divide 459 by 51. 

459 ÷ 51 = 9

Therefore, it will take 9 minutes for the light to blink 459 times.  The answer is 9. 
5 minutes for 255 times, that is 45 seconds for 1 blink.  There are 459 times the light blinks.  The light will take 45 seconds x 459 / 255 = 9 minutes and 3 seconds to blink 459 times.  The answer is 9 minutes and 3 seconds.

 If Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian in 7 days, then Brian will walk half as far as Sofie.  Sofie will walk 7 days * 10 miles per day = 70 miles.  Since Brian will walk half as far, he will walk half of 70, which is 35 miles.  The answer is 35. 
 Sofie walks 10 miles per day for 7 days, which means she will walk 10 x 7 = 70 miles.  Since Brian will walk half as much as Sofie, we have to divide 70 by 2 to get Brian's distance.  70 / 2 is 35.  The answer is 35. 
 Sofie plans to walk 10 miles a day.  In 7 days, she will walk 7 * 10 = 70 miles. 

Since Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, Brian will walk half the distance.  70 / 2 = 35.  Since Brian will walk 35 miles, the answer is 35. 
 Sofie will walk 10 miles every day for 7 days, which means 10 x 7 = 70.  She will walk 70 miles in 7 days.  It is given that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.  This means Brian will walk half the distance.  70/2 = 35.  Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.  The answer is 35. 
 Let's first figure out the distance Sofie will walk in 7 days.  Sofie will walk 10 miles each day, so she will walk a total of 10 * 7 = 70 miles in 7 days. 

According to the problem, Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian.  To find out Brian's total distance in 7 days, we can divide Sofie's distance by 2:

70 miles (Sofie's distance) ÷ 2 = 35 miles

So Brian will walk 35 miles in 7 days.  The answer is 35.

[EXP] 723: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 18, [output]: 5 workers work on the order.  2 workers produce 6 toys per hour, and the other 2 workers produce 4 toys per hour.  In total, they produce 2 x 6 + 2 x 4 toys per hour = 16 toys per hour.  Since 400 - 20 = 380 toys were produced, they produced 380 toys in 10 hours.  So they produced 380 / 10 = 38 toys per hour.  The fifth worker makes up the remaining amount to reach 400.  So the fifth worker's production per hour = 20 / 10 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
400 toys are to be produced.  2 workers produce 6 toys each in an hour, so they produce 12 toys per hour.  Another 2 workers produce 4 toys each in an hour, so they produce 8 toys per hour.  So, in total, the 4 workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.  In 10 hours, they will produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.  

The 400 toys minus the 200 toys produced is 400 - 200 = 200 toys still needed.  Since they only need 20 more, it means the 5th worker produced the remaining 20 toys in 10 hours.  To find out how many toys the 5th worker produced per hour, we divide 20 toys by 10 hours, which is 2 toys per hour.  The answer is 2.

[EXP] 724: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 105, [output]:  Elijah's dog that is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog is 1/4 x 60 = 15 pounds.  Elijah's dog that is half the weight of Kory's dog is 1/2 x 60 = 30 pounds.  So Elijah has 15 + 30 = 45 pounds of dogs.  Kory has 60 pounds of dogs.  45 + 60 = 105.  The answer is 105. 
 Elijah's dog is 1/4 the weight of Kory's dog.  Kory's dog is 60 pounds, so Elijah's dog is 60 / 4 = 15 pounds.  Elijah's other dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, so it is 60 / 2 = 30 pounds.  In total, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  Kory's dog is 60 pounds.  So in total, they weigh 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.  The answer is 105. 
 Elijah has one dog that is 1/4 of Kory's dog, which is 60/4 = 15 pounds.  He also has another dog that is 1/2 of Kory's dog, which is 60/2 = 30 pounds.  So the total weight of Elijah's dogs is 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  Total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs is therefore 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.  The answer is 105. 
 If Elijah's dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog, then it is 1/4 x 60 pounds = 15 pounds.  If another dog is half the weight of Kory's dog, it is 60/2 = 30 pounds.  In total, the two dogs Elijah has weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.  Adding the weights of Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog, we get 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.  The answer is 105. 
 Elijah's dogs weigh together.  

First dog is one-fourth of Kory’s dog, which is 1/4 * 60 = 15 pounds. 

Second dog is half of Kory’s dog, which is 1/2 * 60 = 30 pounds. 

Total weight will be 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  

Kory’s dog is 60 pounds.  So the total weight together is 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.  The answer is 105.

[EXP] 726: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each means John has 3 x 10 = 30 ounces of M&M.  Each ounce has 30 M&M, so in total John has 30 x 30 = 900 M&M. 

John puts 10 M&M in each small bag, so the number of small bags he can make is 900 / 10 = 90. 

The answer is 90. 
3 large bags of M&M are 3 x 10 ounces = 30 ounces.  Since each ounce has 30 M&M, the total number of M&M is 30 x 30 = 900.  If John puts 10 M&M in each small bag, he can make 900 / 10 = 90 small bags.  The answer is 90. 
3 large bags of M&M, each weighing 10 ounces.  So there are 3 * 10 = 30 ounces in total.  Since each ounce contains 30 M&M, there are 30 * 30 = 900 M&M in total.  John puts 10 M&M in each small bag, so we can divide 900 by 10 to find the number of small bags: 900 / 10 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
 John starts with 3 large bags of M&M's, each weighing 10 ounces.  So he has a total of 3 x 10 = 30 ounces of M&M's.  Each ounce has 30 M&M's, so in total he has 30 x 30 = 900 M&M's. 

John wants to put 10 M&M's in each small bag.  To find out how many small bags he can make, we can divide the total number of M&M's (900) by 10: 900 / 10 = 90. 

The answer is 90. 
3 large bags were purchased, each weighing 10 ounces.  So the total weight of M&M's is 3 x 10 = 30 ounces.  An ounce of M&M's has 30 of them.  So in total, there are 30 x 30 = 900 M&M's.  John makes small bags of 10 M&M's at a time.  To find out how many small bags he can make, we divide the total number of M&M's (900) by 10: 900 ÷ 10 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
 John started with 3 large bags weighing 10 ounces each.  So there were 3 x 10 = 30 ounces of M&M's total. 

Then each ounce has 30 M&M's in it.  To find the total number of M&M's, multiply the number of ounces by the number of M&M's in an ounce: 30 ounces * 30 M&M's per ounce = 900 M&M's. 

Now to find out how many small bags John can make, divide the total number of M&M's by how many he puts in each small bag: 900 M&M's / 10 M&M's per bag = 90 small bags. 

The answer is 90.

[EXP] 727: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day.  The distance he needs to fly is half of the way around the earth, which is half of 40,000.  Half of 40,000 is 20,000.  So, he needs to fly 20,000 kilometers.  To find out how many days it will take, we can divide 20,000 by 400.  20,000 ÷ 400 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
400 km is the distance Alfie flies each day.  We need to find out how many days it takes him to fly half the distance around the earth.  Half the distance around the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 km.  We can divide 20,000 km by 400 km per day.  20,000 / 400 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Alfie flies 400 km every day.  We need to find out how many days it takes to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.  Since the circumference of the earth is 40,000 km, half of it is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 km. 

To find out how many days it takes to fly this distance, we need to divide the distance by the distance Alfie flies in a day: 20,000 km / 400 km per day = 50 days. 

The answer is 50. 
400 km is how much Alfie flies per day.  We have to find out how many days it takes to fly 20,000 km, which is half the circumference.  20,000 divided by 400 is 20,000/400 = 50.  The answer is 50 days. 
400 kilometers per day is how far Alfie flies each day.  40,000 kilometers is the circumference of the earth.  So Alfie needs to fly half this distance.  Half of 40,000 is 20,000.  To calculate how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, you can divide 20,000 by 400.  20,000 / 400 is 50.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 728: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]:  The average car can go 120 mph.  The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster, so it can go 120 * 5 = 600 mph.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest, so it can go 600 * 1. 25 = 750 mph.  The answer is 750. 
 The average car can go 120 mph.  The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster, so it goes 5 * 120 = 600 mph.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest, so 600 * 1. 25 = 750 mph.  The answer is 750. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

The average car can go 120 miles per hour. 
The 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car, so it can go 5 x 120 mph = 600 mph. 

The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car, so it can go 1. 25 x 600 mph = 750 mph. 

The answer is 750. 
 The average speed is 120 miles per hour.  The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car, so that would be 5 x 120 = 600 miles per hour.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest, so that would be 1. 25 x 600 = 750 miles per hour. 

The answer is 750. 
 Since the average car goes 120 MPH, the 2nd fastest car goes 5 times faster than that, which is 120 * 5 = 600 MPX.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.  1. 25 x 600 is 750.  The answer is 750. 
 We will break this problem down into smaller parts.  What is the 2nd fastest car's speed? It is 5 times the average car.  So the 2nd fastest car is 5 x 120 = 600.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times the 2nd fastest car.  So the fastest car's speed is 600 x 1. 25 = 750.  The answer is 750.

2 years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.  At that time, his age was twice Vince's age.  So Vince's age was 14 / 2 = 7.  Now, Vince's age will be 7 + 2 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
2 years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14.  And this was twice Vince's age.  So Vince's age 2 years ago was half of 14, or 7.  So Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
2 years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14.  And Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so Vince's age was 14 / 2 = 7.  That was 2 years ago.  Vince's current age is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.  The answer is 9. 
2 years ago, Liam's age was 16 - 2 = 14.  At that time, Liam was twice the age of Vince.  So, Vince must have been 14 ÷ 2 = 7 years old.  Now, Vince is two years older.  He is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.  The answer is 9. 
2 years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14.  We know he was twice the age of Vince.  So 14 is twice the age of Vince.  We can divide both sides by 2 to find Vince's age 2 years ago, which is 14 / 2 = 7.  If Vince was 7 two years ago, he must be 7 + 2 = 9 now.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 730: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 56 eggs were painted in total.  Let's break it down:
- Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.  Let's call it x.  So they painted 2x eggs together. 
- Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, but Camden painted 12 more than Sarah.  So, let's say Sarah painted y eggs.  Then Camden painted y + 12 eggs.  The total number of eggs they painted is 30, so we get the equation: y + (y + 12) = 30. 
Simplifying the equation, we get 2y + 12 = 30.  Subtracting 12 from both sides gives 2y = 18.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives y = 9.  So Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs. 
Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, they painted x eggs together.  Total eggs painted is 56, so we get the equation: x + x + 21 + 9 = 56. 
Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 30 = 56.  Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2x = 26.  Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 13. 
Arnold and Madeline painted 13 eggs each, or x = 13. 
Now, let's find the difference in the eggs painted by Camden and Arnold.  Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13 eggs, so the difference is 21 - 13 = 8. 
The answer is 8. 
56 eggs in total were painted.  2 of them painted the same number of eggs, so let's call it A.  30 eggs are painted by Camden and Sarah, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so if we call Sarah's part S, then Camden's part is S + 12.  So, A + A + S + (S + 12) = 56. 

Combine the parts of the equation where A appears: 2A = 56 - S - 12.  Now subtract 2A from both sides: 56 - S - 12 - 2A = 0.  Simplify the right side: 44 - S - 2A = 0.  Now add S and 2A to both sides: S + 2A = 44. 

Now we can find S and 2A.  We know that A + A = 24.  So, 2A = 24 and S = 44 - 24 = 20.  Finally, Camden's part was S + 12 = 32, and it's 32 - 24 = 8 more than Arnold.  The answer is 8.

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes is 25 x 8 = 200 ounces.  Each crayon also weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.  The total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.  Since 16 ounces is equal to 1 pound, 400 ounces is equal to 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.  The answer is 25. 
 Nik has 200 crayons.  He wants to put them into groups of 8, so there will be 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.  Each box will have 8 crayons, so 25 boxes will have 8 * 25 = 200 crayons.  Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons will be 200 ounces.  Each box weighs 8 ounces, so the total weight of the boxes will be 25 * 8 = 200 ounces.  Total weight is the weight of crayons plus the weight of the boxes, which is 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.  There are 16 ounces to a pound, so there are 400 / 16 = 25 pounds.  The answer is 25. 
 Nik has 200 crayons.  He puts them into boxes of 8 crayons.  So he will need 200 / 8 = 25 boxes.  Each box weighs 8 ounces, so to calculate the weight of the boxes, multiply 25 by 8, which is 200 ounces.  Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so the total weight of the crayons is 200 ounces.  This makes a total weight of 200 + 200 = 400 ounces.  Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, 400 divided by 16 is 25 pounds.  The answer is 25.

80-foot tree can be cut into logs out of 80% of it.  80% of 80 is 80 * 0. 8 = 64 feet of logs.  Each log is 4 feet, so he can cut 64/4 = 16 logs.  Each log can be cut into 5 planks.  So he can make 16 * 5 = 80 planks.  Each plank sells for $1. 2.  So he can make 80 * 1. 2 = 96 dollars.  The answer is 96. 
80% of 80 feet is 0. 8 x 80 = 64 feet.  After cutting the tree into 4-foot logs, the total number of logs is 64 / 4 = 16 logs.  From each log he cuts out 5 planks, so in total there will be 16 x 5 = 80 planks.  Each plank sells for $1. 2, so John will make 80 x 1. 2 = 96 dollars.  The answer is 96. 
80% of the tree is used.  80% of 80 is 0. 80 * 80 = 64.  So he is left with 64 foot logs.  He can cut into 64 / 4 = 16 logs.  Each log is cut into 5 planks, so that is 16 * 5 = 80 planks.  Each plank is sold for $1. 2, so he makes 80 * 1. 2 = 96 dollars.  The answer is 96. 
1st step: Calculate 80% of the tree.  80% of 80 is 0. 8 x 80 = 64. 

A: John cuts 64 feet of the tree into 4-foot logs.  64 / 4 = 16 logs. 

A: From each 4-foot log, he cuts 5 planks.  5 planks per log x 16 logs = 80 planks.

 Jane started by having $0.  After 8 weeks, she has 8 x $4 = $32.  So she has 60 - 32 = 28 dollars left to save.  Since she saves 4 dollars per week, it will take her 28/4 = 7 more weeks to save $60.  The answer is 7. 
 Jane started by having 0 dollars.  Each week, she saved 4 dollars.  So in 8 weeks she saved 8 x 4 = 32 dollars.  She still needs 60 - 32 = 28 more dollars to get to 60.  Since she saves 4 dollars each week, it will take her 28 / 4 = 7 more weeks to save the remaining 28 dollars.  The answer is 7. 
 Jane has 4 dollars saved each week.  For 8 weeks, she has saved a total of 4 x 8 = 32 dollars.  She needs an additional 60 - 32 = 28 dollars.  For 28 dollars, it will take her 28 / 4 = 7 more weeks.  The answer is 7 weeks. 
 Jane saves $4 a week for 8 weeks and has saved $4 x 8 = $32.  To find out how much more she needs, we subtract 32 from 60.  $60 - $32 is $28.  Since she saves $4 a week, it will take her 7 more weeks to save the remaining $28.  The answer is 7.

2 dozen is equal to 24, so Bob will receive 24 more marbles.  If he receives these and already has some, he will have 60 marbles in total.  So, he must have 60 - 24 = 36 marbles initially.  If he loses 10 of those, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.  The answer is 26. 
1 dozen is 12.  So 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24.  Bob received 24 more marbles.  He will have 60 marbles after receiving these extra marbles.  So he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles before getting the extra marbles.  If he loses 10, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.  The answer is 26. 
 If Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles.  2 dozen = 24, so he received 24 more marbles.  He now has 24 + ? = 60 marbles.  So before the 24 marbles, he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles.  If he loses 10 marbles, he has 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left.  The answer is 26.

After receiving 2 dozen more marbles, Bob will have 60 marbles.  A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 2 x 12 = 24 marbles.  Bob will have x + 24 marbles after receiving the additional marbles. 

Since Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving the additional marbles, we can set up the equation:

x + 24 = 60

To solve for x, subtract 24 from both sides:

x = 60 - 24
x = 36

So Bob starts with 36 marbles. 

Now, Bob loses 10 marbles.  To find the number of marbles he'll have after losing them, subtract 10 from the initial number of marbles:

36 - 10 = 26

So Bob will have 26 marbles after losing the 10 marbles. 

The answer is 26. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  

Let's first find out how many marbles Bob has initially.  He receives 2 dozen marbles and will have 60 marbles after receiving those.  2 dozen is equal to 24 marbles (2 x 12), so he received 24 marbles.  Initially, he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles. 

He then loses 10 marbles.  So, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles left. 

The answer is 26.

[EXP] 738: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Donny had 2 mugs of water.  One mug was 33 degrees.  He poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug into his bottle.  So, his bottle now has some degree of temperature from the 33-degree mug.  Let's call the degree of temperature x.  Then his bottle now has (x - 4) degrees. 

The problem states that by adding 1 ounce from the unknown mug, Donny can drink the water.  So, the sum of the temperature of the water in his bottle after adding the 1 ounce must be at least 40 degrees.  This means the equation is:

x - 4 + 1 >= 40

Simplifying the equation:

x - 3 >= 40

Adding 3 to both sides:

x >= 43

So, the temperature of the second bottle is at least 43 degrees.  The answer is 43.

[EXP] 739: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  Melanie's father started with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  That's a total of 50 + 20 = 70 animals. 

Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day, so in 21 days (3 weeks), they will bring 21 x 20 = 420 cows.  So the total cows are 50 + 420 = 470. 

Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day, so in 21 days (3 weeks), they will bring 21 x 10 = 210 chickens.  So the total chickens are 20 + 210 = 230. 

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700.  The answer is 700. 
50 cows and 20 chickens are originally on the farm.  For three weeks, 20 cows are added per day.  So 20 * 3 * 7 = 420 cows were added in three weeks. 

20 chickens are added per day for three weeks, so 10 * 3 * 7 = 210 chickens were added in three weeks. 

So the total number of cows is 50 + 420 = 470, and the total number of chickens is 20 + 210 = 230. 

To find the total number of animals on the farm, add the number of cows and chickens: 470 + 230 = 700.  The answer is 700. 
 Melanie's father started with 50 cows and 20 chickens.  So there are 50 + 20 = 70 animals.  
There are 20 cows coming from Milkie Cows Limited per day for 3 weeks.  That is 7 days a week times 3 weeks, which is 21 days.  So 20 cows per day times 21 days is 20 x 21 = 420.  There are 20 chickens coming from Broilers Limited per day for 3 weeks.  That is 7 days a week times 3 weeks, which is 21 days.  So 10 chickens per day times 21 days is 10 x 21 = 210.  
So the total number of cows after the three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.  The total number of chickens after the three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.  So the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 + 230 = 700.  The answer is 700.

[EXP] 740: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Russell starts by ordering 4 packs of bagels, each costing 10 dollars.  The total cost is 4 x 10 = 40 dollars.  However, he gets a 10% discount.  10% of 40 is 0. 1 x 40 = 4.  So he gets 4 dollars off.  The new total cost is 40 - 4 = 36.  This is the cost for 4 packs of bagels, each of which has 9 bagels.  So the total number of bagels is 4 x 9 = 36.  The cost per bagel is the total cost divided by the number of bagels.  36 / 36 = 1.  The answer is 1 dollar per bagel. 
4 packs of bagels will cost 4 x 10 = 40 without the discount.  A 10% discount means 40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36.  Each bagel in the packs will cost 10 / 9 = 1. 11 per bagel.  After the discount, Russell will pay 36 for 4 packs of 9 bagels.  36 / (4 * 9) = 1. 02.  The answer is 1. 02. 
 Russell orders 4 packs, so originally, he would have spent 4 x 10 = 40 dollars.  Since he got a 10% discount, the price will be 10% less, or 90% of the original price, which is 40 x 0. 9 = 36 dollars.  36 dollars is spent on 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.  So to find the price of each bagel, you divide the 36 spent by the 36 bagels, or 36/36 = 1 dollar.  The answer is 1. 
10% off means you are getting 90% of the original price.  Let's find the original price first.  4 packs of bagels cost 10 x 4 = 40. 00 dollars.  Then, the discount is 40 x 10% = 4 dollars.  So the final cost is 40 - 4 = 36 dollars.  Now we have to find out how many bagels he received.  1 pack has 9 bagels, so 4 packs is 9 x 4 = 36 bagels.  Now to find out how much each bagel costs, we have to divide the cost by the number of bagels.  36 ÷ 36 = 1.  So each bagel will cost 1 dollar.  The answer is 1.

[EXP] 741: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

First, "Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes" means Gomer ate 23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Next, "If it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes" means it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 - 1 = 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. 

Since Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes, let's find the number of potatoes he ate.  To make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes, it takes 3 potatoes.  To make 18 scoops, it will take 3 * 18/2 = 27 potatoes.

[EXP] 742: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Chester will consume 3 * 30 = 90 eggs for the first 30 days.  Then he will consume 5 * 30 = 150 eggs for the next 30 days.  In total, he will consume 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  240 eggs is 240 / 12 = 20 dozens.  The answer is 20. 
 Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so he eats 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  For 30 more days, he eats 5 eggs a day, so 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, he eats 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  To find the number of dozens, we divide 240 by 12, which is 240 / 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
 Chester started by eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days.  3 eggs per day for 30 days is 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  Then, for the next 30 days, he ate 5 eggs a day.  5 eggs per day for 30 days is 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, he ate 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so the total number of dozens of eggs he needs is 240 / 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
30 days ago, Chester ate 3 eggs a day, which is 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  For the next 30 days, he increased it to 5 eggs a day, so he ate 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, he ate 90 + 150 = 240 eggs, or 20 dozens.  The answer is 20. 
1 dozen eggs is equal to 12 eggs.  Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which is 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  He eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days, which is 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  So the total number of eggs is 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  Since 240 is equal to 20 dozen, the answer is 20. 
 Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days.  So that is a total of 3 x 30 = 90 eggs.  After that, he eats 5 eggs a day for 30 days.  So that is a total of 5 x 30 = 150 eggs.  So in total, he eats 90 + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.  Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we can divide 240 by 12.  240 ÷ 12 = 20.  Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs.  The answer is 20.

[EXP] 743: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  There are 17 green jellybeans.  There are twice as many red jellybeans as green, so there are 2 x 17 = 34 red jellybeans.  The total number of jellybeans is 60.  So, the number of blue jellybeans can be found by subtracting the number of green and red jellybeans from the total.  60 - (17 + 34) = 9.  The answer is 9 blue jellybeans. 
 Let's first find the number of red jelly beans.  Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 2 x 17 = 34.  There are 17 green jelly beans and 34 red jelly beans, so the total number of green and red jelly beans is 17 + 34 = 51.  The rest of the jellybeans are blue jelly beans, which means there are 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans.  The answer is 9. 
17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans means there are 17 x 2 = 34 red jelly beans.  17 + 34 = 51 jelly beans that are not blue.  To get the total number of jelly beans, we add the remaining blue jelly beans: 60 = 51 + blue jelly beans.  Subtracting the non-blue jelly beans from the total, we get: 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans.  The answer is 9. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, we know that there are 17 green jelly beans.  We also know that there are twice as many red jelly beans, so we can multiply 17 by 2 to get the number of red jelly beans: 17 x 2 = 34. 

We're told that the total number of jelly beans is 60, so we can add up the green and red jelly beans to find the total number of non-blue jelly beans:

17 (green) + 34 (red) = 51

This means that there are 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans. 

So, Jess is trying to guess the number of blue jellybeans, and there are 9 blue jellybeans in the jar.  The answer is 9. 
17 green jellybeans are already given.  Red jellybeans are twice as much, so that is 17 x 2 = 34 red jellybeans.  In total, we have 17 + 34 = 51 jellybeans so far.  60 jellybeans are there in total, so we need to subtract the jellybeans we have already counted out from the total.  60 - 51 = 9 blue jellybeans are left.  The answer is 9.

 Tim starts with 5 trees and each tree gives 6 lemons.  In one year, he gets 5 x 6 = 30 lemons.  A decade is 10 years, so in a decade he will get 10 x 30 = 300 lemons.  The answer is 300. 
 Tim grows 5 trees.  Each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree.  So in one year, he gets 5 x 6 = 30 lemons.  In 10 years (a decade), he will get 10 times as many lemons.  30 * 10 = 300.  The answer is 300. 
5 trees will produce 6 lemons each.  So, in the first year, Tim gets 5 x 6 = 30 lemons. 

There are 10 years in a decade.  5 trees will produce 6 lemons each every year for 10 years.  So, the total number of lemons Tim gets in a decade is 6 x 10 x 5 = 300.

[EXP] 745: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Since there are 84 passengers total, we can first find the number of men and women.  The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 6

Now we know that there are 6 groups of 5 men and 9 women.  Since there are 5 men in each group, the total number of men is:

5 * 6 = 30

And since there are 9 women in each group, the total number of women is:

9 * 6 = 54

But we are given that 20 women alight from the bus, so the number of women remaining is:

54 - 20 = 34

The answer is 34. 
84 is the total number of passengers, and the ratio of men to women is 5:9.  So the number of men and women are 5x and 9x, where x is a constant.  The total number of men and women is 5x + 9x = 14x.  This equals 84.  So, 14x = 84.  x = 6. 

We know that 9x is the number of women.  x is 6.  So 9*6 is 54.  After 20 women alight, there are 54 - 20 = 34 women remaining on the bus. 

The answer is 34. 
 Since the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the total number of men and women is (5 + 9) = 14.  Since the total number of passengers is 84, this means we can multiply the ratio by 6 to get the actual number of passengers. 
 So, the number of men is 5 * 6 = 30 and the number of women is 9 * 6 = 54.  Originally, there were 54 women.  If 20 women alight the bus, 54 - 20 = 34 women remained on the bus. 
The answer is 34. 
 Since the ratio of men to women is 5:9, let's assume there are x women and y men.  We can set up the following equation:

x + y = 84

We are given that the ratio is 5:9, so we can set up the following equation:

x = 9z
y = 5z

We can substitute these expressions into the equation x + y = 84:

9z + 5z = 84

Combine like terms:

14z = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

z = 6

Now we can substitute z into our expressions for x and y:

x = 9z = 9(6) = 54

y = 5z = 5(6) = 30

Originally, there were 54 men and 54 women on the bus.  After 20 women alight, there are:

54 - 20 = 34

women left on the bus. 

The answer is 34. 
84 is the total number of passengers.  The ratio of men to women is 5:9, which means that every 5 men, there are 9 women.  We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Men + Women = 84

We need to first find how many groups of 5:9 there are in 84.  84 can be divided by 14 (5 + 9), which gives 6 groups.  That means we have 6 times 9 women (54 women) and some remaining women. 

After 20 women alight, the remaining women will be 54 - 20 = 34 women. 

The answer is 34.

He bought rocks for 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.  So he made 20 * 7 = 140 dollars. 
He only sold 60% of the rocks, which is 0. 6 * 20 = 12 rocks.  He sold them for 12 * 7 = 84 dollars. 
He made 84 dollars but used 100 dollars.  So he lost 100 - 84 = 16 dollars. 
The answer is 16. 
 Adam started with 100 dollars.  He can buy rocks for 5 dollars and sell them for 7 dollars each, so his profit per rock is 7 - 5 = 2 dollars.  He has 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.  Selling 60% of the rocks is 0. 6 * 20 = 12 rocks.  He will sell 12 rocks for 12 * 7 = 84 dollars.  Since he invested all his money, he will have 84 dollars after selling the rocks.  To find how much he loses, we subtract his original amount from the amount he has now: 100 - 84 = 16.  He loses 16 dollars.  The answer is 16. 
 Adam has 100 dollars.  He will buy rocks for 5 dollars each.  To find the number of rocks he buys, we'll calculate the total cost of rocks he can buy with 100 dollars:

100 (dollar amount) ÷ 5 (price of each rock) = 20 rocks

Adam buys 20 rocks for 5 dollars each, so the total cost is:

20 rocks * 5 dollars/rock = 100 dollars

Adam sells all the rocks for 7 dollars each.  Since he sells 60% of them, he sells:

20 rocks * 0. 6 (60%) = 12 rocks

The revenue from selling rocks is:

12 rocks * 7 dollars/rock = 84 dollars

Adam invested 100 dollars and earned 84 dollars from the rock sale.  To find the loss, subtract the revenue from the initial investment:

100 dollars (initial investment) - 84 dollars (revenue) = 16 dollars

Adam loses 16 dollars.  The answer is 16. 
 First, let's figure out how many rocks Adam can buy.  He starts with $100.  Each rock costs $5, so 100 ÷ 5 is 20. 

Adam buys 20 rocks.  He can sell each rock for $7.  Since he only sells 60% of his inventory, he sells 20 x 0. 60 = 12 rocks. 

Adam makes a profit of $7 per rock, since he sells each rock for 7 dollars and it costs him 5 dollars to buy the rock.  His total profit would be 12 x 7 = 84. 

Adam spent his entire $100 to buy the rocks, so his total cost is 20 x 5 = 100 dollars.  He made a profit of 84, but he still has a cost of 100.  So he lost 100 - 84 = 16 dollars.  The answer is 16.

110 miles (in 2 hours) + 140 miles (in 3 hours) = 250 miles

Next, let's calculate the total time Sid traveled:

2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

To find the average speed, we divide the total distance (250 miles) by the total time (5 hours):

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

The answer is 50. 
 Since Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, his speed for the first leg was 110 / 2 = 55 miles per hour. 

Then, he traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.  His speed for the second leg was 140 / 3 = 46. 67 miles per hour. 

To find his average speed for the whole trip, we will add the distances and add up the times, and then divide by the total time. 

Total distance = 110 + 140 = 250 miles
Total time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours

Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 250 / 5 = 50 miles per hour

The answer is 50. 
1st step: We need to know Sid's total distance traveled.  He traveled 110 miles initially and then 140 miles later.  So his total distance traveled is 110 + 140 = 250 miles.  2nd step: We need to know Sid's time traveled.  He spent 2 hours initially and then 3 hours later.  So his total time traveled is 2 + 3 = 5 hours.  3rd step: To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total time.  250 / 5 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, we know the total distance Sid traveled is 110 + 140 = 250 miles. 

We also know that Sid took 2 hours and 3 hours to travel this distance. 

To find the average speed, we need to calculate the total time he took, which is 2 + 3 = 5 hours. 

Now we can use the formula: average speed = total distance / total time

Plugging in the values, we get:

average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours
average speed = 50 miles per hour

So, Sid's average speed is 50 miles per hour.  The answer is 50. 
 Firstly, we need to find Sid's total distance traveled.  He traveled 110 miles in 2 hours, and then 140 miles in 3 hours, so the total distance he traveled is 110 + 140 = 250 miles. 

Next, we need to find the total time taken by Sid.  He took 2 hours to travel 110 miles, so the time taken to travel 110 miles is 2 hours.  Then he took an additional 3 hours to travel 140 miles, so the total time taken is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours. 

Now, we need to find the average speed.  This is equal to the total distance divided by the total time.  So, we divide 250 miles by 5 hours, which gives us 50 miles per hour.  The answer is 50. 
1st, we need to calculate the average speed for the first part of the journey.  Distance = 110, Time = 2.  Speed = Distance / Time = 110 / 2 = 55 miles per hour.  Then he traveled 140 miles in 3 hours.  Next, we must find the average speed for the 2nd part of the journey.  Speed = Distance / Time = 140 / 3 = 46. 6666.  (We can round it to 47 since it is more than 46).  The question asked for the average speed, so we need to combine these two parts.  There are in total 250 miles (110 + 140) traveled in 5 hours (2 + 3).  Speed = Distance / Time = 250 / 5 = 50 miles per hour.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 753: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Since one ticket has a 20% chance of winning, that is the same as 0. 20.  The second ticket is three times more likely, which means its chance of winning is 0. 20 * 3 = 0. 60.  To find the probability of both tickets being winners, we multiply their probabilities: 0. 20 * 0. 60 = 0. 12.  To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100: 0. 12 * 100 = 12.  The answer is 12%. 
 Let's calculate the probability of each ticket winning separately.  The first ticket has a 20% or 1/5 chance of winning. 

The second ticket is three times more likely to win, so its chance of winning is 20% * 3 = 60%.  This can be simplified as 3/5. 

To find the probability that both tickets win, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning together:

1/5 * 3/5 = 3/25

To convert this to a percentage, multiply by 100:

(3/25) * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 754: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information given.  Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than Carlos.  This means Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.  Since Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey, Carrey collected 22 / 2 = 11 seashells. 

In total, they collected 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.  They divided the seashells equally between themselves.  Three people divided the seashells, so each person gets 60 / 3 = 20 seashells. 

The answer is 20. 
 Let's first find out how many seashells Carrey collected.  We are told that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey.  So Carrey's collection is x, and Carlos' is 2x.  We know Jim's collection is 5 more than Carlos', so Jim's collection is 2x + 5.  We are also told that Jim's collection is 27, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 5 = 27

Subtract 5 from both sides:

2x = 22

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 11

Now we know Carrey collected 11 seashells.  Carlos collected twice as many, which is 22 seashells, and Jim collected 27 (5 more than Carlos).  In total, they collected 11 + 22 + 27 = 60 seashells.  They divide them equally among themselves, so each person gets:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

The answer is 20. 
 Carlos collected fewer seashells than Jim, so let's call the number of seashells Carlos collected "x".  We know that Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected x + 5.  We also know that Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so x = 2 * Carrey.  

We can write an equation:

x + 5 = 27

Subtracting 5 from 27, we get:

x = 22

Since x is the same as 2 * Carrey, we can write:

2 * Carrey = 22

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

Carrey = 11

Now we know that Carrey collected 11 seashells.  And we know Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carlos collected 2 * 11 = 22.  Jim collected 5 more than Carlos, so Jim collected 22 + 5 = 27.  

In total, they collected 11 + 22 + 27 = 60 seashells.  If they divided them equally between themselves, each person got:

60 / 3 = 20

The answer is 20. 
 Carlos collected a certain number of seashells.  Jim collected 5 more than Carlos.  So we can write this equation:

C + 5 = J

Jim collected 27 seashells. 

27 = J

We can substitute J with 27 in the equation:

C + 5 = 27

Subtract 5 from both sides:

C = 22

So Carlos collected 22 seashells.  He collected twice as many as Carrey, so Carrey must have collected half of 22, which is:

22/2 = 11

Now we know how many seashells each person collected.  Since they divided them equally among themselves, the total seashells is the sum of the individuals:

22 + 27 + 11 = 60

So there are 60 seashells in total.  Each person gets an equal share, so:

60 ÷ 3 = 20

The answer is 20 seashells per person.

5 days in a week are weekdays.  Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays.  So on weekdays, he eats 5 * 4 = 20 carrots.  On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 2 days * 5 carrots each = 2 x 5 = 10 carrots.  In total, he eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots a week.  The answer is 30. 
5 days a week are weekdays, and 2 days a week are Saturday and Sunday.  So, the total number of carrots he eats is 4 * 5 (for weekdays) + 5 * 2 (for Saturday and Sunday).  That's 20 + 10 = 30 carrots.  The answer is 30. 
 MASON LIKES EATING CARROTS!

Let's count the number of carrots Mason eats in a week. 

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays (Monday to Friday), which is 4 x 5 = 20 carrots. 

On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 carrots. 

In total, Mason eats 20 + 10 = 30 carrots in a week. 

The answer is 30. 
5 days is a weekdays.  He eats 4 carrots each on weekdays.  4 * 5 = 20.  He eats 20 carrots on weekdays.  On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 each day.   5 + 5 = 10.  So he eats 10 carrots on the weekend.  Add them together, 20 + 10 is 30.  The answer is 30.

[EXP] 756: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]: 60% longer than 5 minutes means that the second song is 5 + (0. 60 * 5) = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes long.  So the total time is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.  The answer is 13. 
 John starts with a 5-minute song.  The second song is 60% longer, so it is 5 * (1 + 0. 6) = 8 minutes.  So the total cassette is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.  The answer is 13. 
 The second song is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes.  To find the length of the second song, you can multiply 5 by 1. 6 (since 60% is the same as 0. 6) to get 8 minutes.  The total length of the cassette is the sum of the lengths of the two songs, which is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.  The answer is 13. 
 Let's first find the length of the second song.  If the first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 60% longer, then the second song is 5 * (1 + 60%) = 5 * 1. 6 = 8 minutes.  The total time is the time of both songs, so it is 5 + 8 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
 The first song was 5 minutes long.  The second song was 60% longer, so the second song was 5 * 1. 6 = 8 minutes long.  The total length of the cassette was 5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.  The answer is 13. 
 First, find the length of the second song.  If the first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 60% longer, that means the second song is 5 x 1. 60 = 8 minutes.  Then, add the length of the two songs together.  5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes.  The answer is 13 minutes. 
 The 1st song is 5 minutes.  The 2nd song is 60% longer.  This means the 2nd song is 1. 6 times as long as the 1st song.  So the 2nd song is 5 x 1. 6 = 8 minutes.  The total duration is the 1st song + the 2nd song.  5 + 8 = 13.  The answer is 13 minutes. 
1st song is 5 minutes and 2nd song is 60% longer.  60% of 5 minutes is 5 x 60% = 5 x 0. 6 = 3 minutes.  The 2nd song's time is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes.  The total time of the cassette is 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.  The answer is 13.

[EXP] 757: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Linus buys a mobile device for $20.  He sells it for 2 times the original price, which is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  So his profit for each device is 40 - 20 = 20 dollars. 

He bought 2 devices on monday, so he made a profit of 20 * 2 = 40 dollars on monday. 

He bought 4 devices on tuesday, so he made a profit of 20 * 4 = 80 dollars on tuesday. 

In total, he made a profit of 40 + 80 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
1 device was bought for 20 dollars.  Linus sold it for 2 times the original price, so he sold it for 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  Thus, Linus made a profit of 40 - 20 = 20 dollars for one device.  If Linus bought 2 devices on Monday, he made a total profit of 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  On Tuesday, he bought 4 devices, sold them for 40 dollars each, and made a profit of 4 x 20 = 80 dollars.  In total, Linus made a profit of 40 + 80 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  

First, let's figure out how much Linus got for each device.  He sells it for twice the original price, which is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars. 

He bought 2 devices on Monday, so he sold 2 devices for 40 dollars each.  2 x 40 = 80 dollars. 

He bought 4 devices on Tuesday, so he sold 4 devices for 40 dollars each.  4 x 40 = 160 dollars. 

In total, Linus sold 6 devices and got 80 + 160 = 240 dollars. 

He spent 2 x 20 = 40 dollars on Monday and 4 x 20 = 80 dollars on Tuesday.  So in total, he spent 40 + 80 = 120 dollars. 

His profit is his income minus his expenses.  240 - 120 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Linus sells the device for twice the price he bought it.  He sold it for 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  He made a profit of 40 - 20 = 20 dollars for each device.  He bought 2 devices on Monday.  20 x 2 = 40.  Then he bought 4 devices on Tuesday.  4 x 20 is 80.  Altogether he made 40 + 80 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120.

1.  Isabel is 7 feet tall. 
2.  Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall. 
3.  Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall. 
4.  Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so the length of the cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet. 

The answer is 3. 
 Let's work backwards.  Isabel is 7 feet tall.  Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.  Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.  The answer is 3. 
 Since Isabel is 7 feet tall, Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.  Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  Carl has a cane that is half his height, so his cane is 6/2 = 3 feet long.  The answer is 3. 
 Let's start with Isabel, who is 7 feet tall.  Since Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.  Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  Carl's cane is half as long as Carl, so the length of the cane is 6/2 = 3 feet.  The answer is 3. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  Isabel is 7 feet tall. 
2.  Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, so Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall. 
3.  Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, so Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall. 
4.  Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, which means Carl's cane is 1/2 * 6 = 3 feet long. 

The answer is 3. 
 Let's start by using the information that Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel.  Since Isabel is 7 feet tall, Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.  Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  If Carl is one foot taller than his brother Ned, and Ned is 5 feet tall, then Carl is 6 feet tall.  According to the problem, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.  Half of 6 is 3.  The answer is 3. 
 Carl's height is unknown, so let's start by using the fact that Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, which is 7 feet.  So, Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.  Since Carl is one foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  According to the problem, Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, so we can find the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2.  6 / 2 is 3.  The answer is 3 feet.

The answer is 50. 
8 babies were born in total.  3/4 of them, or 8 * 3/4 = 6 babies, were dressed in purple.  So 8 - 6 = 2 babies were dressed in blue.  1/3 of babies dressed in purple also wear bows.  1/3 of 6 is 6/3 = 2 babies.  So 2 blue babies and 2 purple babies wear bows.  To find the percentage chance of a baby wearing a bow being purple, you would divide the number of purple babies wearing bows (2) by the total number of babies wearing bows (4, 2 blue and 2 purple) and multiply by 100.  2/4 * 100 = 50%.  The answer is 50%. 
8 babies were born.  1/4 of 8 is 2, which are wearing blue.  The rest, 8 - 2 = 6, are wearing purple.  1/3 of 6 is 2, which are wearing purple and bows.  Now we need to find what percentage of the babies wearing bows are wearing purple.  We can start by finding what percentage of the babies are wearing purple: (purple babies / all babies) x 100% = (6 / 8) x 100% = 75%.  Now, we need to find what percentage of the babies wearing bows are wearing purple.  We can do this by finding how many purple babies are wearing bows, which is 2, and dividing that by the total number of babies wearing bows, which is 2 + 2 (blue babies wearing bows) = 4.  (purple babies wearing bows / total babies wearing bows) x 100% = (2 / 4) x 100% = 50%.  The answer is 50%.

Total number of eggs found = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27

Number of eggs still hidden = 36 - 27 = 9

The answer is 9. 
1 dozen = 12 eggs, so Cole started with 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  Stacy finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.  Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.  Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.  In total, 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs were found.  So, 36 - 27 = 9 eggs are still hidden.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 766: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1248, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

First, let's find the number of apartments in the last complex.  The first two complexes have 200 apartments each, so the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 2 x 200 = 400.  The last complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined, so to find the number of apartments in the last complex, we multiply the total number of apartments in the first two by 1. 6 (since 60% is the same as 0. 6):

400 x 1. 6 = 640

So, the total number of apartments is 400 + 640 = 1040. 

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, so he collects 3 x 1040 = 3120 times per week. 

He gets paid $0. 40 per collection, so the total amount of money he makes per week is:

3120 x $0. 40 = $1248

The answer is 1248. 
 First, add the number of apartments at the first two apartments: 200 + 200 = 400.  The last one is 60% bigger than the other two combined, which means it is (1 + 0. 60) * 400 = 640 apartments.  Add the last one to the total: 400 + 640 = 1040.   He collects garbage 3 times a week, so there are 3 * 1040 = 3120 apartments.  He gets paid $0. 40 per collection for each apartment, so he makes 3120 * 0. 40 = 1248.  The answer is 1248.

[EXP] 767: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2350, [output]: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits, 6-year-old tree produces 3 times as much, so 3 x 50 = 150.  7-year-old tree produces 7 times as much, so 7 x 50 = 350.  8-year-old tree produces 200 less than a 10-year-old tree.  10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, so 20 x 50 = 1000.  8-year-old tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800.  So, the total fruit production in 10 years is 50 + 150 + 350 + 0 + 800 = 1450.  The answer is 1450. 
5-year-old avocado tree: 50 fruits. 
A 6-year-old avocado tree: 50 * 3 = 150 fruits. 
A 7-year-old avocado tree: 50 * 7 = 350 fruits. 
An 8-year-old avocado tree: A 10-year-old produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 2 * 50 = 100.  Then 200 less than that is 100 - 200 = -100.  Since the problem states an 8-year-old produces fruits, this doesn't count. 
Now we have 50 + 150 + 350 + (-100) = 450 fruits. 
After 9 years, no fruits are produced. 
In the 10th year, a 10-year-old tree produces 50 * 20 = 1000 fruits. 
Adding everything together, 450 + 1000 = 1450.  The answer is 1450.

[EXP] 768: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Jack started with $100.  Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100.  To find 1/5 of $100, we can divide $100 by 5.  $100 ÷ 5 = $20.  So Sophia gave Jack $20.  Jack had $100 initially, and then he got $20 from Sophia, so he had $100 + $20 = $120.  The answer is 120. 
100 dollars is divided in 5 equal parts, so each part has 100 / 5 = 20 dollars.  Sophia gave Jack 1/5 of her 100 dollars, which is 20 dollars.  

Jack had 100 dollars originally.  After receiving 20 dollars from Sophia, he has 100 + 20 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
 Jack started with 100 dollars.  Sophia gave him 1/5 of her 100 dollars.  To find out how many dollars Sophia gave Jack, we need to multiply 100 by 1/5.  This is a multiplication problem, so we can rewrite it as a multiplication: 100 * 1/5 = 100 * 0. 2 = 20.  So Sophia gave 20 dollars to Jack.  Adding 20 to Jack's 100 dollars, Jack now has 100 + 20 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120.

[EXP] 769: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Let's say the length of the blue rope is x.  Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is 4x. 

The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, so the length of the yellow rope is x + 7. 

The 3 ropes have a combined length of 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4x) + (x + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

So the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.  The length of the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is:

4x = 4(5) = 20 centimeters

The answer is 20 centimeters. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Let the length of the blue rope be x.  Since the yellow rope is 7 centimeters longer than the blue rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7. 

The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4x. 

The problem statement says that the combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

So the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters. 

The length of the yellow rope is 5 + 7 = 12 centimeters. 

The length of the red rope is 4 times the length of the blue rope, so the length of the red rope is 4 × 5 = 20 centimeters. 

The answer is 20. 
 Let's use the information to set up an equation.  Let's say the length of the blue rope is x centimeters.  Since the blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope, the length of the yellow rope is x + 7 centimeters. 

The total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + 4x = 37

Combine like terms:

6x + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6x = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 5

So the length of the blue rope is 5 centimeters.  Since the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, the length of the red rope is:

4x = 4(5) = 20 centimeters

The answer is 20. 
 Let's break it down step by step:

1.  The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  Let's call the length of the yellow rope "y".  Then, the length of the blue rope is y - 7. 
2.  The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope.  So, the length of the red rope is 4(y - 7). 
3.  The combined length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.  We can write an equation:

y + (y - 7) + 4(y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

y + y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37

Simplify the equation:

6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6y = 72

Divide by 6:

y = 12

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope is 12 centimeters, we can find the length of the blue rope:

Blue rope = y - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters

And finally, the length of the red rope is:

Red rope = 4(y - 7) = 4(5) = 20 centimeters

The answer is 20.

[EXP] 770: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ronnie was given $5, so Rissa was given 5 x 3 = 15 dollars.  If they each gave the same amount to their little sister, they each gave 1/2 of their money.  So, Ronnie gave 5 / 2 = 2. 50 dollars.  Rissa gave 15/2 = 7. 50 dollars.  Rissa is now left with 15 - 7. 50 = 7. 50 dollars, and it is 4/5 of what she had initially.  So Rissa had 7. 50 x 5/4 = 9. 38 dollars initially.  Ronnie had 5 - 2. 50 = 2. 50 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 50. 
 Ronnie started with $5.  Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa got 5 * 3 = 15 dollars.  After they both gave the same amount to their sister, they each gave away x dollars.  So 5 - x = x and 15 - x = 15/5 x = 3.  From this we can get that 2 x = 5 and x = 2. 5.  So they each gave 2. 5 dollars to their sister.  Ronnie had 5 - 2. 5 = 2. 5 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 5. 
 Ronnie was given $5 while Rissa was given 3 x 5 = 15 dollars.  

After they each give an equal amount to their sister, let the amount be x.  

Their money left is Rissa's original amount - x and Ronnie's original amount - x. 

Rissa has 4/5 of her original amount.  So, 
15 - x = 4/5 * 15 
x = 15 - 12 = 3

So they gave 3 dollars each to their sister. 
Now we need to find out how much Ronnie has.  Ronnie had 5 dollars originally, gave away 3 dollars.  Ronnie has 5 - 3 = 2 dollars. 

The answer is 2.

[EXP] 771: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2, [output]: 12 pints of paint were used in total.  Since half the mural is yellow, and yellow is only used once, 6 pints are used for yellow paint.  The other three colors, red, white, and purple, are used equally, so they use 12/3 = 4 pints each.  Since it's an equal amount of red, white, and purple paint, each of them uses 4 pints.  The answer is 4. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

* There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, so let's call the amount used for each of these colors x. 
* Half the mural is yellow, so the amount of yellow paint is the total amount of paint used minus the amount of red, white, and purple paint, or 12 - 3x. 
* The total amount of paint used is 12, so the equation becomes 12 = 3x + (12 - 3x). 
* Simplifying the equation, we get 12 = 12, which means x is 4. 
* Since there is an equal amount of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint used is x, which is 4 pints. 

The answer is 4. 
12 is the total amount of paint.  Half of the mural is yellow, which means that there is 6 pints of paint used for the yellow.  Let's add the amount of paint for the other three colors.  Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple, we can say that they each take up 6 / 3 = 2 pints.  Then the total paint used by the red, white, and purple paint is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 pints.  Since red, white, and purple take up the remaining part of the mural, they must use up the rest of the 12 pints, which is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.  Subtracting the 2 pints used by red, white, and purple, 6 - 2 = 4 pints were used for red paint.  The answer is 4.

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet. 

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. 

So the total area of the house is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet. 

The answer is 3160. 
 Tom has 4 bedrooms, each measuring 20 by 12 feet.  To find the area of one bedroom, we multiply the length and width: 20 * 12 = 240 square feet.  There are 4 bedrooms, so the total area of the bedrooms is 4 * 240 = 960 square feet. 

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is 5 * 240 = 1200 square feet. 

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. 

To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet. 

The answer is 3160. 
 There are 4 bedrooms.  Each measures 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.  So the total area of the bedrooms is 4 x 240 = 960 square feet.  The living room is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  The total area of the house is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.  The answer is 3160 square feet. 
 Let's start by finding the area of one bedroom.  The bedroom is 20 by 12 feet, so the area is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.  Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area of all the bedrooms is 4 x 240 = 960 square feet. 

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so the area of the living room is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet. 

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. 

To find the total area of the house, add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house:

960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160

The answer is 3160. 
 Tom has 4 bedrooms of 20 x 12 feet each.  The area of one bedroom is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.  So the total area of the bedrooms is 4 x 240 = 960 square feet. 

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it is 240 x 5 = 1200 square feet. 

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  So the total area of the house is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.  The answer is 3160. 
 Tom has 4 bedrooms, each of which is 20 by 12 feet.  So the area of one bedroom is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.  If we multiply this by 4, we get the area of the bedrooms, which is 4 x 240 = 960 square feet. 

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's area is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet. 

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. 

So the total square footage of the house is the area of the bedrooms (960) plus the area of the living room (1200), plus the rest of the house (1000). 

The total square footage is 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160. 

The answer is 3160. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step:
First, we need to find the area of the 4 bedrooms.  We know that each bedroom is 20 feet by 12 feet, so we can multiply the length and width to get the area:
20 * 12 = 240 square feet (for one bedroom)
Since there are 4 bedrooms, the total area is:
4 * 240 = 960 square feet

The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so its area is:
240 * 5 = 1200 square feet

The rest of the house, 1000 square feet, can be added to the total area:
1200 + 1000 = 2200 square feet

Now, let's include the area of the bedrooms into the total:
2200 + 960 = 3160 square feet

The answer is 3160.

The special size box has 20% more pods, which is 120 pods.  120 pods cost $12, so each pod costs $12/120 = $0. 10.  If we use 1 pod per cycle, we can run 1 cycle for $0. 10.  The answer is 10. 
100 dishwasher pods in the regular box cost $12.  The special box has 20% more, which means it has 120 pods.  The price is the same, so the cost per pod is 12 / 120 = 0. 10.  Since 1 pod per cycle, $1 can run 1 / 0. 10 = 10 cycles.  The answer is 10. 
20% more pods means that the new box has 1. 2 times the pods as the 100-pod box.  So the new box has 100 x 1. 2 = 120 pods.  The cost of the box is the same as the regular box, so the cost per pod in the new box is $12/120 = $0. 1.  If you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run the dishwasher $0. 1 per cycle.  The answer is 10 cycles. 
 The new box has 20% more pods.  This means the new box has (100 + 20)% pods.  (100 + 20)% = 120%.  120% of the 100 pods is 1. 2 * 100 = 120 pods.  The price is $12 for 120 pods, so per pod, it is $12 / 120 = $0. 10.  To find the number of cycles you can run for $1, you can divide $1 by $0. 10, which is 10 cycles.  The answer is 10. 
100 pods per 12 dollars.  The special box has 20% more.  To find 20% of 100, we do 0. 20 * 100 = 20.  So the special box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.  We can do the same calculation for the cost per pod.  The cost per pod for the special box is 12 dollars / 120 pods = 12 / 120 = 0. 10 dollars per pod.  The special box costs 12 dollars for 120 pods.  We want to know how many pods we can run for 1 dollar.  1 dollar / 0. 10 = 10.  The answer is 10.

2.  In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 x 2 = 8 goals. 
3.  Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half, which is 1/4 of 8 = 2 goals. 
4.  In the first half, team A scored 4 goals and team B scored 2 goals, for a total of 4 + 2 = 6 goals. 
5.  In the second half, team A scored 2 goals and team B scored 8 goals, for a total of 2 + 8 = 10 goals. 
6.  The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored in the first and second halves: 6 + 10 = 16. 

The answer is 16. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

In the first half, Team A scores 4 goals.  Team B scores 2 fewer goals than Team A, which means Team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals. 

In the second half, Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so it scores 4 x 2 = 8 goals.  Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals. 

The total number of goals scored by Team A in the match is 4 (from the first half) + 2 (from the second half) = 6 goals.  The total number of goals scored by Team B in the match is 2 (from the first half) + 8 (from the second half) = 10 goals. 

The total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (by Team A) + 10 (by Team B) = 16 goals.  The answer is 16. 
 Team A scored 4 goals in the first half.  Team B scored 2 fewer, so Team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.  In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so it scored 2 x 4 = 8 goals.  Team A scored 1/4 the number of goals scored by team B, so it scored 8/4 = 2 goals in the second half.  In total, Team A scored 4 + 2 = 6 goals, and team B scored 2 + 8 = 10 goals.  6 + 10 is 16.  The answer is 16. 
 Let's start with the goals scored in the first half.  Team A scored 4 goals.  Team B scored 2 fewer goals than team A, so team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half. 

In the second half, team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so it scored 2 x 4 = 8 goals.  Team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals Team B scored, so it scored 1/4 x 8 = 2 goals.

[EXP] 777: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2, [output]: 5-inch chalk originally.  45% was used on the first day.  Since 45% is 45/100 or 9/20, that means 9/20 * 5 inches were used.  So 9/20 * 5 inches = 2. 25 inches were used.  So the chalk was reduced to 5 - 2. 25 = 2. 75 inches.  The teacher tries to use 20% each day, which is 1/5.  So he can use 1/5 * 2. 75 = 0. 55 inches each day.  Now, to find out how many days, we divide 2. 75 by 0. 55, which is 5.  The answer is 5. 
5-inch piece of chalk.  The teacher started with the full piece of chalk.  The teacher used 45% of the chalk by the end of the day.  So 45% is 5 * 0. 45 = 2. 25 inches.  The teacher has 5 - 2. 25 = 2. 75 inches left.  He will recycle the chalk when it's less than 2 inches.  The answer is the number of days he can use this piece of chalk. 

1.  First, the teacher will use 20% of the remaining chalk each day.  20% of 2. 75 is 2. 75 * 0. 2 = 0. 55 inches. 

2.  After each day, he has 2. 75 - 0. 55 = 2. 2 inches left. 

3.  This continues until he has less than 2 inches.  Let's count the days: 2. 75 - 0. 55 = 2. 2, 2. 2 - 0. 55 = 1. 65, 1. 65 - 0. 55 = 1. 1, 1. 1 - 0. 55 = 0. 55, 0. 55 - 0. 55 = 0 inches. 

4.  It took 4 days to get to 0 inches.  The teacher will recycle the chalk after the 5th day.  The answer is 5.

 Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls.  One third of the girls and one fourth of the boys are on varsity.  So the number of girls on varsity is 12 x 1/3 = 4.  The number of boys on varsity is 12 x 1/4 = 3.  In total, 4 + 3 = 7 students are on varsity.  So the number of students not on varsity is 12 + 12 - 7 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
 Miss Albert's class is composed of 12 boys and 12 girls.  In total, there are 12 + 12 = 24 students in the class. 

One-third of the girls are on varsity.  One-third of 12 is 4, so 4 girls are on varsity. 

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.  One-fourth of 12 is 3, so 3 boys are on varsity. 

In total, 4 girls and 3 boys are on varsity.  That makes a total of 4 + 3 = 7 students on varsity. 

The number of students not on varsity is the total number of students minus the number of students on varsity.  24 - 7 = 17. 

The answer is 17. 
 Let's start by finding the total number of students in the class: 12 boys + 12 girls = 24

One-third of the girls are on varsity, so we need to find one-third of 12:
12 ÷ 3 = 4

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity, so we need to find one-fourth of 12:
12 ÷ 4 = 3

So, 4 girls and 3 boys are on varsity.  To find the total number of students on varsity, we add these together: 4 + 3 = 7

The number of students who are not on varsity is the total number of students minus the number of students on varsity:
24 (total students) - 7 (students on varsity) = 17

The answer is 17. 
1/3 of the girls are on varsity.  There are 12 girls, so 1/3 of 12 girls is 12 / 3 = 4.  So 4 girls are on varsity.  

1/4 of the boys are on varsity.  There are 12 boys, so 1/4 of 12 boys is 12 / 4 = 3.  So 3 boys are on varsity. 

In total, 4 girls and 3 boys are on varsity.  That's 4 + 3 = 7 students on varsity. 

There are 12 boys and 12 girls in total, for a total of 12 + 12 = 24 students.  Out of these, 7 are on varsity, which means there are 24 - 7 = 17 students not on varsity. 
The answer is 17. 
12 boys and 12 girls constitute the class.  One-third of the girls is 12 / 3 = 4 girls.  One-fourth of the boys is 12 / 4 = 3 boys.  So, there are 4 girls on varsity and 3 boys on varsity.  In total, 4 + 3 = 7 students are on varsity. 

So, all the other students are not on varsity.  There are 12 boys and 12 girls in the class, so 12 + 12 = 24 students total.  Subtracting the 7 students on varsity, we get 24 - 7 = 17 students not on varsity. 

The answer is 17.

2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk is equal to 2/5 x 4000 = 1600 gallons.  Since the company sold the milk at 3. 5 dollars per gallon, it refunded Mr.  Marcellus 3. 5 x 1600 = 5600 dollars for the 1600 gallons.  The answer is 5600 dollars. 
4000 gallons of milk were purchased at $3. 5 per gallon, so 4000 x 3. 5 = 14000 dollars were paid.  However, 2/5 of the milk was returned, which is 4000 * 2/5 = 1600 gallons.  The refund per gallon is the same as the original purchase price, so the refund is 1600 x 3. 5 = 5600 dollars.  The answer is 5600. 
4000 gallons of milk were sold at 3. 5 dollars per gallon.  So the total amount of money Mr.  Marcellus paid is 4000 x 3. 5 = 14000. 

But, 2/5 of the milk expired, so 2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons of milk could not be sold.  Since the company gives a refund, they will return 3. 5 x 1600 = 5600 dollars to Mr.  Marcellus. 

The answer is 5600. 
2/5 of the milk could not be sold.  2/5 * 4000 = 1600 gallons.  So that is 1600 gallons not sold.  He got a refund for this amount.  The company sold each gallon at 3. 5 dollars.  So the refund would be 1600 * 3. 5 = 5600 dollars.  The answer is 5600.

[EXP] 782: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's start by solving the problem step by step. 

We know that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.  This means that Wendy's current age can be represented by W, and Colin's age 7 years from now can be represented by C + 7. 

We can set up an equation based on this information: W = 5(C + 7)

We are also given that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.  This means that Colin's age 25 years from now can be represented by C + 25, and Wendy's age 25 years from now can be represented by W + 25. 

We can set up another equation based on this information: C + 25 = (1/3)W

We now have two equations and two variables.  We can solve for C (Colin's current age) by substituting the expression for W from the first equation into the second equation:

(C + 25) = (1/3)(5(C + 7)) + 25

Simplifying the equation, we get:

C + 25 = (5C + 35) / 3

C + 25 = (5C + 35) / 3

Multiply both sides by 3 to get:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Subtract 5C from both sides:

-2C + 75 = 35

Add 2C to both sides:

75 = 7C + 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

40 = 7C

Divide both sides by 7:

4 = C

So, Colin is currently 4 years old. 

The answer is 4.

This caused 5 apples to fall out, and he picked those up.  So he now had 5 + 1 = 6 apples, and he put all but 1 into his pocket.  Now he has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket.  He threw the remaining apple and caused 6 more apples to fall out.  He picked those up, so now he has 5 (in his pocket) + 6 = 11 apples.  The answer is 11. 
2 apples fell initially, and 1 was picked up and 1 thrown.  5 more apples fell and 4 were picked up, so there are 1 + 4 = 5 apples left, and 1 was thrown.  6 more apples fell and all of them were picked up, so there are 5 + 6 = 11 apples.  In total, Newton picked up 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 apples and brought them home.  The answer is 11. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step:

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. 

One apple landed on Newton's head, and he picked it up, so we have 1 apple. 

He threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out.  So now, he has 1 apple in his hand and 5 more apples. 

He put all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he has 1 apple and 4 apples in his pocket.  He threw the remaining one at the tree, which caused another 6 apples to fall out. 

Now, he has 1 apple in his hand, 4 apples in his pocket, and 6 apples.  He picked up all the remaining apples and went home. 

So, he brought home a total of 1 (the one he picked up) + 4 (from his pocket) + 6 (from the remaining apples) = 11 apples.

850 kilos of coal is being ordered and coal comes in 50 kg bags.  So the number of bags needed is 850 / 50 = 17.  Since each bag costs $18, the total cost is 17 * 18 = 306 dollars.  The answer is 306. 
850 kilos of coal have to be delivered in 50 kg bags.  To find the number of 50 kg bags, divide the total number of kilos by 50. 

850 / 50 = 17

The order requires 17 units of coal.  Each unit costs 18 dollars.  So the total cost is:

17 x 18 = 306

The answer is 306. 
850 kg is in total.  It is divided into 50 kg bags.  So divide 850 by 50.  850 ÷ 50 = 17.  This means there are 17 bags.  The price of each bag is $18.  17 * 18 = 306.  The answer is 306. 
850 kg is the total amount of coal ordered.  How many 50 kg bags do we need? We can divide 850 by 50 to find out.  850 / 50 is 17.  So Ali will need 17 bags of 50 kg each.  Each bag costs 18 dollars, so the total cost is 17 x 18 dollars.  17 x 18 is 306.  The answer is 306. 
850 kg of coal is ordered.  To figure out how many 50 kg bags that is, we need to divide 850 by 50: 850 / 50 = 17.  So Ali ordered 17 bags of coal.  Each bag costs $18.  So that is 17 x $18 = $306.

To make 60 snowballs, he needs to make 60 / 22 = 2. 72 iterations.  2. 72 iterations at 105 minutes each is 2. 72 * 105 = 229. 2 minutes or approximately 3. 82 hours.  The answer is 3. 82 hours. 
 Jay can make 20 snowballs in 1 hour.  So he will make 60 snowballs in 3 hours.  However, two snowballs melt every 15 minutes.  15 minutes is 0. 25 hours.  Since it takes 0. 25 hours for 2 snowballs to melt, he can make 8 snowballs in 0. 25 hours, not lose 2.  So it will take him 3 hours to make 60 snowballs.  The answer is 3 hours. 
 Jay can build 20 snowballs in an hour.  But, 2 melt every 15 minutes.  

In an hour, he will build 20 snowballs.  But, 4 snowballs will melt in an hour (2 every 15 minutes * 2).  So, he will have 20 - 4 = 16 snowballs after an hour. 

To get to 60 snowballs, he needs 60 - 16 = 44 more snowballs.  Since he can build 20 snowballs in an hour, it will take him 44 / 20 = 2 hours to make 44 more snowballs. 

So, it will take 1 hour to build the initial 16 snowballs and 2 more hours to make the remaining 44 snowballs.  Therefore, it will take in total 1 + 2 = 3 hours for Jay to have 60 snowballs.  The answer is 3. 
 Jay builds 20 snowballs in 1 hour.  In 2 hours, he will have 20 * 2 = 40 snowballs.  He has 20 by the end of the first hour and 40 by the end of the second hour.  He has 60 - 40 = 20 snowballs less than he needs, or 20 snowballs short.  That's 1 hour.  It will take an additional hour to build the rest of the snowballs.  But we have to subtract the snowballs that melt.  2 melt every 15 minutes.  In 1 hour, that is 4 snowballs.  So Jay will build 20 in the first hour and 40 in the second hour and subtract 4 that melt.  He still needs 20 more.  So it will take 1 more hour because he can build 20 more in that hour.  The answer is 3 hours.

[EXP] 793: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 280, [output]: 7. 5 hours x 6 days x 4 weeks = 180 hours.  180 hours * 1. 5 dollars per hour = 270 dollars.  She also receives an additional 10 dollars for no absences, so her total earnings are 270 + 10 = 280 dollars.  The answer is 280 dollars. 
7. 5 hours a day, 6 days a week.  So that is 7. 5 * 6 = 45 hours a week.  For 4 weeks, that is 45 * 4 = 180 hours.  Her hourly rate is $1. 5, so her earnings are 180 * 1. 5 = 270.  If she gets an additional $10 for complete attendance, that is 270 + 10 = 280.  The answer is 280. 
1st, we calculate the total hours Jen works in a month.  7. 5 hours/day * 6 days/week * 4 weeks = 7. 5 * 6 * 4 = 180 hours. 

Next, we calculate her total wages.  180 hours * $1. 5/hour = 180 * 1. 5 = 270 dollars. 

Finally, we add her attendance bonus.  270 dollars + 10 dollars = 280 dollars. 

The answer is 280. 
7. 5 hrs a day for 6 days a week means Jen works 7. 5 x 6 = 45 hours in a week.  Since there are 4 weeks in April, she will work 4 x 45 = 180 hours during April.  With an hourly rate of $1. 5, her salary will be 180 x 1. 5 = 270 dollars.  Jen also receives an additional $10 for complete attendance.  So her total salary is 270 + 10 = 280 dollars.  The answer is 280. 
7. 5 hours a day * 6 days a week = 7. 5 * 6 = 45 hours a week.  The hourly rate is 1. 5 dollars.  45 hours * 1. 5 = 67. 5.  So, Jen earns 67. 5 dollars a week from her work.  Since there are 4 weeks in April, Jen earns 67. 5 * 4 = 270 dollars from her work.  She also receives an additional 10 dollars for complete attendance, which results in a total of 270 + 10 = 280.  The answer is 280.

[EXP] 794: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jason earned money for doing laundry, cleaning his room, taking out the trash, and emptying the dishwasher. 

For laundry, he earned $3. 00 only once, so that is $3. 00. 

For cleaning his room, he earned $1. 50 only once, so that is $1. 50. 

For taking out the trash, he did it twice and earned $0. 75 each time, so that is 2 x 0. 75 = $1. 50. 

For emptying the dishwasher, he did it 6 times and earned $0. 50 each time, so that is 6 x 0. 50 = $3. 00. 

Adding up all the money he earned, Jason earned 3 + 1. 5 + 1. 5 + 3. 0 = 9. 0 dollars.  The answer is 9. 
 Let's calculate Jason's earnings separately for each activity and then add them up. 

Jason earned $3. 00 for doing his laundry, which is a one-time event. 

He emptied the dishwasher 6 times at $0. 50 each, so that's a total of 6 x $0. 50 = $3. 00

He took the trash out 2 times at $0. 75 each, so that's a total of 2 x $0. 75 = $1. 50

He cleaned his room once at $1. 50

To sum it up, Jason earned:
$3. 00 + $3. 00 + $1. 50 + $1. 50 = $9. 00

The answer is 9.

[EXP] 795: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1200, [output]: 1 whale has 40 gallons of blood.  A shark has three times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has 3 x 40 = 120 gallons of blood.  There are 10 sharks swimming in the sea, so they have 10 x 120 = 1200 gallons of blood.  The answer is 1200. 
 There are 10 sharks.  Each shark has 3 times as much blood as a whale.  So each shark has 40 * 3 = 120 gallons of blood.  The total number of gallons of blood for 10 sharks is 10 x 120 = 1200.  The answer is 1200. 
40 gallons is the blood in one whale.  Since a shark has 3 times as much blood as a whale, a shark has 3 x 40 = 120 gallons of blood.  If there are 10 sharks, they will have a total of 10 x 120 = 1200 gallons of blood.  The answer is 1200. 
 If a shark has 3 times as much blood as a whale, then each shark has 3 * 40 = 120 gallons of blood.  If there are 10 sharks, 10 * 120 = 1200 gallons of blood.  The answer is 1200. 
40 gallons of blood is how much a whale has.  A shark has 3 times as much, so a shark has 40 x 3 = 120 gallons of blood.  Then, if 10 sharks are swimming in the sea, they have 10 x 120 gallons of blood.  10 x 120 is 1200.  The answer is 1200. 
 Since a shark has 3 times as much blood as a whale, a shark has 40 x 3 = 120 gallons of blood.  There are 10 sharks, so we multiply the amount of blood one shark has by 10: 10 x 120 = 1200.  The answer is 1200. 
10 sharks swimming in the sea are equivalent to 10 times the number of whipped compared to 1 shark.  The total volume of blood of a shark is 3 times the volume of blood of a whale, which is 40 gallons.  So the volume of blood of a shark is 40 * 3 = 120 gallons.  The amount of blood of 10 sharks swimming in the sea will be 10 * 120 = 1200 gallons.  The answer is 1200.

Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 am came in, which is 2 x 40 = 80 people.  90 + 80 = 170.  Finally, 3 times as many people entered as the number that came in first, which is 3 x 50 = 150 people.  170 + 150 = 320.  The answer is 320. 
50 people entered the restaurant initially.  Then 40 more people entered.  So 50 + 40 = 90 people entered in the morning and at 10:00.  Then, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 (which is 2 * 40 = 80) entered in the afternoon.  90 + 80 = 170 people.  Then, 3 times the number of people who entered initially (which is 3 * 50 = 150) entered.  170 + 150 = 320.  The answer is 320. 
50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.  At around 10:00, 40 more entered.  Then, twice the number of people that entered at 10:00 entered later, which is 40 x 2 = 80.  Finally, 3 times as many people as the first 50 entered in the evening, which is 50 x 3 = 150.  The total number of people that entered the restaurant is 50 + 40 + 80 + 150.  50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320.  The answer is 320. 
50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.  At 10, 40 more people entered.  50 + 40 = 90 people.  Then, "twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00" means twice the 40, so 40 x 2 = 80 people came in.  Now we add 80 to 90.  90 + 80 = 170.  If we add "3 times as many people as the number that came in first", we mean 3 times as many as 50.  50 x 3 = 150 people.  Adding this to 170, we get 170 + 150 = 320.  The answer is 320.

In total, there are 25 + 50 = 75 pens.  The answer is 75. 
5 packs of red pens and 5 * 2 = 10 packs of black pens.  Alain's mom bought a total of 5 + 10 = 15 packs of pens.  Each pack has 5 pens.  So 5 x 15 = 75 pens in total.  The answer is 75. 
 Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so that is 5 x 5 = 25 red pens.  The amount of black pens is twice the amount of red pens, so it is 2 x 25 = 50.

[EXP] 798: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.  Each bottle must cost 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  He buys twice as many cognac bottles, which is 10 x 2 = 20 bottles.  Since each cognac bottle costs 50% more than the scotch, that means it costs 60 x 1. 5 = 90 dollars.  The total cost for cognac will be 20 x 90 = 1800.  The total cost for everything is 1800 + 600 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
 John bought 10 bottles of scotch.  These cost $600 in total, so each scotch bottle costs 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  Now, he bought twice as many bottles of cognac.  That means he bought 2 * 10 = 20 bottles of cognac.  Each cognac bottle cost 50% more than a scotch bottle, which means it cost 60 * 1. 5 = 90 dollars.  In total, John spent 10 * 60 = 600 dollars on scotch and 20 * 90 = 1800 dollars on cognac.  600 + 1800 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
10 bottles of scotch cost 600 dollars.  600 / 10 = 60 dollars per bottle of scotch.   He also bought twice as many bottles of cognac.  So that means he bought 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.  The price of cognac is 50% more than scotch.  So the cognac is 1. 5 times the scotch, or 1. 5 * 60 = 90 dollars per bottle of cognac.  20 bottles of cognac will cost 20 * 90 = 1800 dollars.  The total cost of everything will be the cost of scotch (600 dollars) plus the cost of cognac (1800 dollars).  600 + 1800 = 2400.  The answer is 2400 dollars. 
 The bottles of scotch cost 600 dollars in total.  So each scotch bottle costs 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  The scotch bottles are 60 dollars each. 

For the cognac, we know John buys twice as many bottles as scotch bottles.  Since he bought 10 scotch bottles, he buys 10 x 2 = 20 cognac bottles.  Each cognac bottle costs 50% more than the scotch bottle.  The scotch bottle costs 60 dollars.  So each cognac bottle costs 60 x 1. 5 = 90 dollars. 

Total money spent on cognac bottles = 20 x 90 = 1800 dollars. 

Total money spent on everything = 600 (scotch) + 1800 (cognac) = 2400 dollars. 
The answer is 2400.

[EXP] 801: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 8 more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is 40.  This can be written as 40 = 8 + 4x, where x is the number of coffee mugs.  First, subtract 8 from both sides: 40 - 8 = 4x, which gives us 32 = 4x.  Then, divide both sides by 4: 32/4 = x, which gives us x = 8.  The answer is 8. 
8 more than four times the number of coffee mugs is 40.  In terms of math, this is 4x + 8 = 40.  To solve for x, we first subtract 8 from both sides: 4x = 40 - 8, so 4x = 32.  Then, we divide both sides by 4: x = 32 / 4.  So, x = 8.  The answer is 8. 
40 is 8 more than four times the number of coffee mugs, so we need to find what 40 minus 8 is.  That would be 32.  This is the four times the number of coffee mugs.  To find the number of coffee mugs, we divide 32 by 4, and we get 8.  The answer is 8.

1/3 of the fish have red stripes.  One-third of 66 is 22, so 22 fish have red stripes. 

The remaining fish are 66 - 22 = 44.  5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.  5/11 of 44 is 20, so 20 fish have blue stripes. 

In total, 22 + 20 = 42 fish have red or blue stripes.  The answer is 42. 
1/3 of the fish have red stripes.  66 * 1/3 = 22.  So there are 22 fish with red stripes.  Now, there are 66 - 22 = 44 fish remaining.  5/11 of these have blue stripes.  44 * 5/11 = 20.  So there are 20 fish with blue stripes.  In total, 22 + 20 = 42 fish have red stripes and blue stripes.  The answer is 42. 
1/3 of the fish have red stripes.  66 ÷ 3 = 22 fish have red stripes.  Then, 66 - 22 = 44 fish are left.  5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.  44 × 5 ÷ 11 = 20 fish have blue stripes.  To find the total number of fish with red or blue stripes, we add the two numbers together: 22 + 20 = 42.  The answer is 42. 
66 fish are in the fish tank.  One-third of the fish have red stripes, so the fish with red stripes is 66 / 3 = 22.  The remaining fish is 66 - 22 = 44.  5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so the fish with blue stripes is 44 * 5/11 = 20.  Altogether, there are 22 fish with red stripes and 20 fish with blue stripes, which is 22 + 20 = 42.  The answer is 42. 
1/3 of the fish have red stripes.  So the number of fish with red stripes is 1/3 of 66, which is 66/3 = 22.  That leaves 66 - 22 = 44 fish without red stripes.  5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, so the number of fish with blue stripes is (5/11) * 44, which is approximately 20.  In total, 22 + 20 = 42 fish have red and blue stripes.  The answer is 42.

The first floor is thrice his height, so it is 3 x 60 = 180 inches.  The roof is from the second floor's floor, so we need to subtract the second floor's height from the total house height.  The second floor's height is 420 - 180 = 240 inches.  The answer is 240. 
 Mattison's house is 7 times as high as he is.  Mattison is 60 inches, so the total height of the house is 7 x 60 = 420 inches.  The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so the first floor height is 3 x 60 = 180.  The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the total height minus the first floor height.  420 - 180 = 240.  The answer is 240. 
60 inches is Mattison's height.  His house is 7 times taller than him, so the total height of the house is 7 x 60 = 420 inches.  The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so it's 3 x 60 = 180 inches.  That means the second floor's floor is 420 - 180 = 240 inches away from Mattison's head.  The roof from the second floor's floor is that 240 inches.  The answer is 240. 
 Mattison is 60 inches tall.  His two-story house is 7 times as high as him, so the total height of the house is 7 x 60 = 420 inches.  The floor to ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so that is 3 x 60 = 180 inches.  If the house is 420 inches tall, then the second floor ceiling is 420 - 180 = 240 inches from the first floor.  The roof is also the second floor ceiling, so it is 240 inches from the floor.  The answer is 240. 
 Let's start by finding the height of Mattison's two-story house.  He is 60 inches tall, and the house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is 7 x 60 = 420 inches. 

The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is the height of the second floor, subtracting the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.  The first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, so the first floor is 3 x 60 = 180 inches high.  The roof is the height of the house minus the height of the first floor, which is 420 - 180 = 240 inches. 

The answer is 240.

700 is the total number of shells.  Alphas found 40% of it.  To find 40% of 700, multiply 700 by 0. 4, which is 280.  So Alphas found 280 shells.  The remaining shells are 700 - 280 = 420.  The finders found 60% of the remaining shells, which is 60% of 420.  60% of 420 is 60/100 * 420 = 252.  They found 252 shells.  Now, the total found so far is 280 + 252 = 532.  There are 700 - 532 = 168 shells left.  Therefore, the Gogetters found 168 shells.  The answer is 168. 
700 shells were originally discovered.  Team Alphas found 40%.  40% of 700 is 0. 4 x 700 = 280.  The finders found 60% of the remaining shells.  But first, we need to calculate the remaining shells.  If Alphas found 280, then 700 - 280 = 420 shells are remaining.  60% of 420 is 0. 6 x 420 = 252.  We need to find out how many shells Gogetters found.  To do this, we subtract the shells found by Alphas and The finders from the total number of shells.  700 - 280 - 252 = 168.  The answer is 168. 
20% of the shells were taken up by team Alphas.  So 700 * . 40 = 280 shells.  That leaves 700 - 280 = 420 shells.  The finders got 60% of the remaining shells.  60% of 420 is 420 * 0. 6 = 252 shells.  So the finders got 252 shells, and must have 420 - 252 = 168 left.  The answer is 168. 
20 tourists found 700 shells.  Team Alphas found 40% of them.  To find 40% of 700, first convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.  40/100 = 0. 4.  Multiply this by 700 to find the number of shells found by Alphas: 0. 4 * 700 = 280 shells. 

So 700 - 280 = 420 shells are remaining.  Team The finders found 60% of these remaining shells.  Convert the percentage to a decimal as before: 60/100 = 0. 6.  Multiply this by 420: 0. 6 * 420 = 252 shells. 

So, 420 - 252 = 168 shells remained.  These were found by team Gogetters.  The answer is 168. 
700 is the total number of shells originally.  40% of the shells were found by Team Alphas.  40% is 40/100, which is 0. 4.  0. 4 * 700 is 280 shells.  So, Team Alphas found 280 shells.  Now, we need to find the number of shells left.  We subtract the shells found by Alphas from the original number of shells: 700 - 280 = 420.  420 shells are left.  The finders found 60% of these shells.  60% is 60/100, which is 0. 6.  0. 6 * 420 is 252 shells.  So, Team The finders found 252 shells.  Now, we know that Team The finders found 252 shells from the 420 shells left.  This means that 420 - 252 = 168 shells are left.  Team Gogetters found the remaining shells.  The answer is 168.

[EXP] 806: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 dogs need a total of x miles per day.  The first dog needs 1 mile, the second dog needs 4 miles, and the third dog needs 3 miles.  So 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles are needed for the first 3 dogs.  Since they need an average of 3 miles per day, 4 dogs must need 4 * 3 = 12 miles per day.  Subtract the miles needed for the first 3 dogs to find the miles needed for the last dog: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.  The answer is 4. 
 The first dog needs 1 mile, the second dog needs 4 miles, and the third dog needs 3 miles.  That is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.  The average is 3 miles.  So to find out how many miles the last dog needs, we can subtract the total from the number of dogs multiply the average. 
We have 4 dogs, and the average for each dog is 3 miles.  So the total miles for all dogs is 3 * 4 = 12. 
The 3rd question already added the miles for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd dogs, so we need to subtract this from the total. 
12 - 8 is 4.  The answer is 4.

 John's house is worth 250,000 dollars.  40% of that is 0. 40 x 250,000 = 100,000.  He got a loan worth 100,000 dollars.  He uses 60% of that, or 0. 60 x 100,000 = 60,000, to pay off his debts.  So he has 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 dollars leftover.  The answer is 40,000. 
 John's house is worth 250,000 dollars.  He gets a loan of 40% of that.  To find 40% of 250,000, multiply 250,000 by 0. 4 = 100,000.  So he gets 100,000 dollars.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  To find 60% of 100,000, multiply 100,000 by 0. 6 = 60,000.  So he uses 60,000 dollars to pay off his debts.  He is left with 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 dollars.  The answer is 40,000. 
40% of 250,000 is 40% * 250,000 = 0. 4 * 250,000 = 100,000.  This is the loan amount.  He uses 60% of that to pay off debts.  0. 6 * 100,000 = 60,000.  So he paid 60,000 to pay off debts.  He is left with the remaining amount of the loan, which is 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000.  The answer is 40,000. 
 John's house is worth 250,000 dollars.  He gets a loan worth 40% of that.  40% of 250,000 is 40/100 * 250,000 = 100,000.  So his loan is 100,000. 

He uses 60% of that loan to pay off his debts.  60% of 100,000 is 60/100 * 100,000 = 60,000.  So he pays off his debts with 60,000. 

He had 100,000 - 60,000 dollars left.  100,000 - 60,000 is 40,000.  The answer is 40,000. 
 John's house is worth 250,000 dollars.  He gets a loan worth 40% of that.  To find 40% of 250,000, we can multiply it by 0. 4:

250,000 x 0. 4 = 100,000

So, the loan amount is 100,000 dollars.  He uses 60% of that to pay off his debts.  To find 60% of 100,000, we can multiply it by 0. 6:

100,000 x 0. 6 = 60,000

So, he pays off 60,000 dollars in debt.  To find out how much money he has leftover, we subtract the amount he paid off from the original loan amount:

100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000

The answer is 40,000. 
250,000 is worth of the house.  40% of that is 40% * 250,000 = 0. 40 * 250,000 = 100,000.  This is the amount of the loan.  He uses 60% of this amount to pay off his debt.  60% of 100,000 is 0. 6 * 100,000 = 60,000.  This is the amount he pays off his debt.  This means he used 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000.  So, he has 40,000 left.  The answer is 40,000.

[EXP] 808: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Deandre caught 3 tunas.  The weights of the tunas are 56 kg, 46 kg, and 26 kg.  So the total weight is 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kg.  128 kg of tuna will be 128 x 0. 50 = 64 dollars.  The answer is 64. 
 Deandre caught 3 tunas.  The first one weighs 56 kilograms, the second one weighs 46 kilograms, and the last one weighs 26 kilograms.  In total, Deandre caught 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms of tuna.  Since each kilogram costs $0. 50, the total he will earn is 128 * 0. 5 = 64 dollars.  The answer is 64. 
 Let's first find the total weight of the tunas Deandre caught. 

The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms. 
The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms. 
The third tuna weighs 26 kilograms. 
In total, the 3 tunas weigh 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms. 

Each kilogram of tuna costs $0. 50, so the total amount Deandre will earn is:

128 kilograms x $0. 50 per kilogram = 64 dollars. 

The answer is 64. 
 First, let's add the weights of the three tunas caught by Deandre: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms. 

Then, since 1 kilogram of tuna costs $0. 50, we can calculate the total amount Deandre will earn by multiplying the weight by the cost per kilogram:

128 kilograms * $0. 50 per kilogram = 64 dollars

So Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market. 

The answer is 64.

[EXP] 810: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  The device removes 1 liter of water per day on the low setting, so in 3 days it will remove 1 * 3 = 3 liters of water.  Then for 3 days on the medium setting, it will remove 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 liters of water.  Then for 5 days on the high setting, it will remove 1 * 2 * 2 * 5 = 20 liters of water.  So in total, the device will remove 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.  The answer is 29. 
 Brian started on the low setting, which removes 1 liter per day.  So for 3 days, it removed 3 x 1 = 3 liters of water.  

Then Brian switched to the medium setting.  This setting removes twice as much water as the low setting, or 2 x 1 = 2 liters per day.  For 3 days, this means it removed 3 x 2 = 6 liters of water. 

Then Brian switched to the high setting.  This setting removes twice as much water as the medium setting, or 2 x 2 = 4 liters per day.  For 5 days, this means it removed 5 x 4 = 20 liters of water. 

In total, Brian removed 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters of water.  The answer is 29. 
 Let's start by finding the amount of water the dehumidifier removed each day on each setting: 

- On the low setting, 1 liter per day. 
- On the medium setting, 2 * 1 = 2 liters per day (twice as much as low setting). 
- On the high setting, 2 * 2 = 4 liters per day (twice as much as the medium setting). 

Since Brian ran the dehumidifier for:
- 3 days on the low setting, he removed 1 * 3 = 3 liters. 
- 3 days on the medium setting, he removed 2 * 3 = 6 liters. 
- 5 days on the high setting, he removed 4 * 5 = 20 liters. 

Adding these up, Brian removed 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters of water from the air in his basement.  The answer is 29. 
 There are already some solutions given.  I will solve this problem following the same pattern. 

Brian started with 0 liters of water removed.  On the low setting, he ran it for 3 days, so 3 x 1 = 3 liters of water were removed.  Then he moved to the medium setting.  Each day on the medium setting is twice as much as the low setting, so it is 2 liters per day.  He did this for 3 days, so 2 x 3 = 6 liters of water were removed.  Finally, he moved to the high setting.  On the high setting, it is twice as much as the medium setting, so it is 4 liters per day.  He did this for 5 days, so 4 x 5 = 20 liters of water were removed.  In total, the dehumidifier removed 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters of water.  The answer is 29.

 First, let's find out how many balloons they had in total.  10 packs of 30 balloons each is 10 x 30 = 300 balloons.  Then, after the afternoon, they have 12 balloons left.  So they must have thrown 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.  The answer is 288. 
 There are originally 10 packs of balloons.  Each pack has 30 balloons.  So, Jolene and her friends have 10 x 30 = 300 balloons.  After they throw some balloons, they are left with 12 balloons.  So, they threw 300 - 12 = 288 balloons.  The answer is 288. 
 They started with 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons, so that's a total of 10 x 30 = 300 balloons.  After the fight, 12 balloons are left.  So, they threw 300 - 12 balloons.  300 - 12 is 288.

[EXP] 812: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 448, [output]: 14 mL is the first medicine.  Since the second medicine is 3 times that amount, the second medicine is 14 x 3 = 42 mL.  So for one dosage, they have 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  For 8 dosages, they will have 56 * 8 = 448 mL.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of the first medicine.  This amount is described as "one medicine".  The second medicine is "3 times that amount", so 14 * 3 = 42.  Together, that is 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine in one dose.  For 8 doses, there would be 8 * 56 = 448 mL.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL is the amount of the first medicine.  The second medicine is 3 times as much, so it's 14 * 3 = 42 mL.  Then in each dose, there will be 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine, so that's a total of 14 + 42 = 56 mL for each dose.  8 doses would be 8 x 56 = 448.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL of one medicine is given.  The second medicine is 3 times as much, so it is 14 x 3 = 42 mL. 

Together, the two medicines are 14 + 42 = 56 mL in one dose. 

If we need to calculate for 8 doses, we multiply 56 mL by 8:

56 mL/dose x 8 doses = 448 mL

The answer is 448. 
 First, determine the amount of the second medicine.  Since it is 3 times the amount of the first medicine, which is 14 mL, then it will be 14 x 3 = 42 mL.  

So in one dosage, a total of 14 + 42 = 56 mL of medicine are required.  We are asked to find the amount of medicine for 8 doses.  56 mL per dose * 8 doses = 56 * 8 = 448 mL.  The answer is 448. 
14 mL is the dosage of the first medicine.  The second medicine has 3 times that amount, so it is 14 * 3=42 mL.  Now, if 14 mL of the first medicine is combined with 42 mL of the second medicine, it makes a total of 14 + 42 = 56 mL.  Now we need to find out how much medicine will be in 8 doses.  For one dose, the total amount is 56 mL.  So for 8 doses, it will be 8 x 56 = 448 mL.  The answer is 448. 
 For the first medicine, the medical dosage is 14 mL.  For the second medicine, it is 3 times that amount.  3 times 14 mL is 14 * 3 = 42 mL.  In total, the first dose will have 14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL medicine. 

To find out how much medicine Saanvi will need for 8 doses, we multiply the amount of medicine needed per dose by 8.  56 mL * 8 = 448 mL.  The answer is 448 mL.

Since John has two classes, the combined capacity of his classes is 15 * 2 = 30 students.  The total capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150.  The answer is 150. 
 Ali's class can hold 120 students.  John's classes can each hold 1/8th of that, which is 120 / 8 = 15 students.  Since he has 2 classes, the total capacity of his classes is 15 x 2 = 30.  The total capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150.  The answer is 150. 
 John's class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class, which has 120 students.  So John's class has 120 / 8 = 15 students.  He has two classes, so his school has 15 + 15 = 30 students in total.  The combined capacity of both schools is then 120 + 30 = 150.  The answer is 150. 
 Since Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, we can find the capacity of John's two classes by multiplying the capacity of Ali's class by 1/8:

1/8 * 120 = 15

So each of John's classes has a capacity of 15 students.  The total capacity of John's two classes is:

15 + 15 = 30

To find the combined capacity of both schools, we add the capacity of Ali's class to the total capacity of John's classes:

120 + 30 = 150

The answer is 150. 
 Since Ali's class has a capacity of 120 students, each of John's classes has a capacity of 1/8th of that, which is 120/8 = 15 students. 

There are two classes in John's school, so the total capacity is 15 x 2 = 30. 

Ali teaches one class with a capacity of 120 students.  To find the combined capacity, we add the capacities of both schools: 120 + 30 = 150.

The interest is 2% of 300, which is 0. 02 x 300 = 6.  So in the 12th month, Stephen will pay his sister 25 + 6 = 31 dollars.  The answer is 31. 
 Stephen started with 300 dollars.  He has been paying 25 dollars for 11 months.  So, 25 x 11 = 275 dollars.  He still owes 300 - 275 = 25 dollars.  The remaining amount including the interest will be paid.  The interest is 2% of 300, which is 0. 02 x 300 = 6 dollars.  So, the remaining amount is 25 + 6 = 31 dollars.  The answer is 31. 
 Originally, Stephen borrowed 300 dollars.  He will pay back 300 + 6 (2% of 300) = 306 dollars in total.  He has been paying 25 dollars per month for 11 months.  So, Stephen has paid 25 * 11 = 275 dollars.  To pay back the remaining amount, including interest, he needs to pay 306 - 275 = 31 dollars.  The answer is 31. 
 Stephen started with a borrowed amount of 300 dollars.  For 11 months, he will give his sister 25 dollars per month, which is a total of 25 * 11 = 275.  This means he still owes 300 - 275 = 25 dollars.  The additional 2% interest of 300 dollars is 2% * 300 = 0. 02 * 300 = 6.  So the amount he needs to pay in the twelfth month is 25 + 6 = 31 dollars.

 Jordan has 2 children.  Each child requires 5 diaper changes per day, so in total they require 2 x 5 = 10 diaper changes per day.  His wife changes half of the diapers, which is 10/2 = 5 diaper changes.  Jordan changes the remaining diaper changes, which is 10 - 5 = 5 diaper changes.  The answer is 5. 
 Jordan has 2 children, so 2 * 5 = 10 diapers are required per day.  Since Jordan's wife changes half, that means Jordan changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.  The answer is 5. 
2 children, 5 diaper changes each, is 2 x 5 = 10 diaper changes.  Jordan's wife changes half of them, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5.  Jordan changes the remaining diapers.  10 - 5 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
2 children require 5 diaper changes each, so in total, they require 2 x 5 = 10 diaper changes per day.  Jordan's wife changes half of these, so she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diaper changes.  Therefore, Jordan changes the other half, which is 10 - 5 = 5 diaper changes per day.  The answer is 5. 
2 children times 5 diapers each is 2 x 5 = 10 diapers.  Since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, that means she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers.  Jordan changes the remaining diapers.  10 - 5 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
2 children require 5 diaper changes each.  So the total diaper changes are 2 * 5 = 10.  If Jordan's wife changes half, then Jordan changes half as many diapers, which is 10 / 2 = 5.  The answer is 5.

[EXP] 816: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  We will first calculate how many jelly beans can fit in the jar.  The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height.  The length and width are both 6 inches, and the height is 15 inches.  So the volume is 6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches.  The volume is then multiplied by 80% efficiency, so 540 x 0. 8 = 432 cubic inches.  Since each jelly bean takes up 0. 15 cubic inches, we divide 432 by 0. 15 to determine the total number of jelly beans that can fit in the jar.  This is 2880. 

We know that only 30% of the jelly beans are red.  Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is 2880 x 0. 3 = 864.  The question states that the true number of red jelly beans is 900.  To determine how far off his guess is, we subtract his estimated number of red jelly beans from the true number.  This is 900 - 864 = 36.  The answer is 36. 
 First, find the volume of the jar.  Volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height.  So 6 * 6 * 15 is 540.  Since the jar is only 80% efficient, the actual volume of jelly beans is 540 * 0. 8 = 432.  Each jelly bean takes up 0. 15 cubic inches, so you can divide 432 by 0. 15 to get 2880.  We are told that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so we can take 30% of 2880, which is 2880 * 0. 3 = 864.  But this question asks about Tim's original guess.

[EXP] 817: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, the bus had 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60. 

At the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered the bus again.  Since 40 people entered at the first station, 3/4 of 40 is 30.  So, 30 people entered the bus at the second station, making the total number of people 60 + 30 = 90. 

At the third station, the number of passengers doubled, so the total number of people becomes 90 x 2 = 180. 

The capacity of the bus is 200 people.  Since there are already 180 people on the bus, the remaining spaces needed to fill the bus are 200 - 180 = 20. 

The answer is 20. 
 The bus starts with 20 people.  On the first stop, 40 people enter.  So, there are 20 + 40 = 60 people on the bus.  At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered on the first stop enter again.  3/4 of 40 is 30.  So, 30 people enter on the second stop, making 60 + 30 = 90 people on the bus.  At the third station, the number of passengers doubles, so the number of people on the bus becomes 90 * 2 = 180.  The bus has a capacity of 200 people.  So, the remaining space is 200 - 180 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
1st step: There are originally 20 people on the bus.  40 people enter at the first station.  So 20 + 40 = 60 people. 
2nd step: On the second station, 3/4 of the people who entered at the first station entered.  3/4 of 40 is 30.  So 30 people enter at the second station.  60 + 30 = 90. 
3rd step: At the third station, the number of passengers doubles.  So from 90, it becomes 90 * 2 = 180 people. 
4th step: The bus has a capacity of 200 people.  180 people are already in the bus.  So 200 - 180 = 20 more people are required to fill the remaining spaces.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  The bus starts with 20 people. 
2.  On the first stop, 40 people enter the bus, so the total number of people on the bus becomes 20 + 40 = 60. 
3.  On the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station enter the bus.  Since 40 people entered the bus at the first station, 3/4 of 40 = 30 people enter the bus at the second station.  Now the total number of people on the bus is 60 + 30 = 90. 
4.  The number of passengers on the bus doubles on the third station, which means the bus now has twice the number of people it had before.  Since the bus had 90 people before, it now has 90 x 2 = 180 people. 
5.  The bus has a capacity of 200 people.  The number of people already on the bus is 180.  To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus, subtract the number of people already on the bus from the total capacity:

200 (total capacity) - 180 (number of people already on the bus) = 20

The answer is 20. 
 Let's first find the total number of people on the bus after the first stop.  The bus had 20 passengers initially and 40 entered, so 20 + 40 = 60.  After the second stop, 3/4 of 40 (which is 30) entered the bus.  60 + 30 = 90.  The number of passengers doubled at the third stop, so now there are 90 * 2 = 180 passengers.  The capacity of the bus is 200, and the bus already has 180 people.  To find the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces, we subtract 180 from 200, which gives 20.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

Initially, the bus has 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 people entered the bus, making the total number of people 20 + 40 = 60. 

At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered the bus at the first stop (40 people) entered the bus.  This is equal to 30 people (3/4 of 40).  So, the total number of people is now 60 + 30 = 90. 

The bus has a capacity of 200 people and currently has 90 people.  To find the number of empty seats, subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 90 = 110 seats remaining. 

At the third stop, the number of passengers doubles.  To do this, we add the current number of people to itself: 90 + 90 = 180 people. 

Now, we need to find the number of people required to fill the remaining seats.  To do this, subtract the current number of people from the capacity: 200 - 180 = 20 seats remaining. 

Since the remaining seats can be filled with people, we need the same number of people to fill the seats.  Therefore, the answer is 20.

[EXP] 818: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Pauline visits the museum 3 times per year and after 5 years she continues to visit for 3 more years.  So, the total number of visits she makes is 3 x 5 = 15 visits in the first 5 years, and 3 x 3 = 9 visits in the next 3 years, for a total of 15 + 9 = 24 visits. 

In the first 5 years, the cost of a visit is $2, so Pauline spends 2 x 15 = $30 in the first 5 years. 

After 5 years, the cost of a visit increases by 150% to $5 (since 150% of 2 is 3 and 3 + 2 = 5).  The cost of 9 visits at $5 each is 9 x 5 = $45. 

In total, Pauline spends $30 + $45 = $75. 

The answer is 75. 
1) Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year.  So, in 5 years, she will visit 5 x 3 = 15 times. 

Cost of 1 visit initially: 2 dollars
After a 150% increase, the new cost of one visit is 2 x (150% + 100%) = 2 x 2. 5 = 5 dollars

The cost of each visit is different, so let's calculate the total cost of the initial 15 visits:
Initial cost: 15 x 2 = 30 dollars

For 3 more years:
Cost of one visit in new rate: 3 x 5 = 15 dollars

3 x 3 = 9 visits in 3 more years
Total cost in new rate: 9 x 5 = 45 dollars

Combining the total cost of both periods: 30 + 45 = 75
The answer is 75.

[EXP] 819: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 225, [output]: 10 students in each grade means that there are 4 * 10 = 40 students in total in grades 4-7.  Since 8 can try the escape room at a time, the total number of groups is 40 / 8 = 5.  Each group takes 45 minutes.  So 5 groups will take 5 * 45 minutes = 225 minutes to try the escape room.  The answer is 225. 
8 students can try the escape room at a time.  There are 4 grades - 7, 6, 5, and 4.  Each grade has 10 students.  So, there are 4 x 10 = 40 students total.  They will go 8 at a time, so the number of groups is 40 / 8 = 5.  Each group takes 45 minutes.  So, 5 x 45 = 225.  The answer is 225. 
10 students in each grade with the most points will be challenged.  Since there are 4 years of grade, there are 10 * 4 = 40 students total.  Since only 8 students can try at a time, it will take 40 / 8 = 5 groups.  Each group takes 45 minutes, so the total time it will take is 5 * 45 = 225 minutes.  The answer is 225. 
10 students per grade, and there are 4 grades, so 10 x 4 = 40 students total in total.  Only 8 can try the escape room at a time.  To find out how many groups can be made, divide 40 by 8.  So 40 / 8 = 5.  Each group takes 45 minutes.  So it will take 5 groups x 45 minutes = 225 minutes to get all 40 students to try the escape room.  The answer is 225 minutes.

4 wooden tables for 20 dollars each: 4 x 20 = 80 dollars
2 roof frames for 10 dollars each: 2 x 10 = 20 dollars
Total amount Ali has to pay John: 80 + 20 = 100 dollars
The answer is 100. 
4 tables for $20 each will be 4 x 20 = $80.  Two roof frames for $10 each will be 2 x 10 = $20.  In total, Ali has to pay John $80 + $20 = $100.  The answer is 100. 
 John manufactured 4 wooden tables at $20 each, so the total cost for those tables is 4 x 20 = 80.  He also manufactured 2 roof frames at $10 each, so the total cost for those frames is 2 x 10 = 20.  In total, Ali needs to pay John 80 + 20 = 100 dollars.  The answer is 100. 
 Since there were 4 wooden tables for $20 each, John will get 4 x 20 = 80 dollars for the tables.  Additionally, 2 roof frames for $10 each will be 2 x 10 = 20 dollars.  So Ali has to pay John 80 + 20 = 100 dollars.  The answer is 100.

[EXP] 821: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Ian starts with a board that is 40 feet long.  He makes a cut, and the longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece.  Let's call the length of the shorter piece x.  Then the longer piece is 4x. 

Since the total length of the board is 40 feet, we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet

The answer is 32. 
 Let's call the shorter piece "x" feet long.  Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, it's 4x feet long.  The total length of the board is 40 feet, so we can set up an equation: x + 4x = 40. 

Combine like terms: 5x = 40. 

Divide by 5: x = 8. 

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long, and the longer piece is 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet long.  The answer is 32. 
 Ian has a board that is 40 feet long.  Let's assume the shorter piece is x feet.  The longer piece is 4x.  We know that x + 4x = 40.  5x = 40.  x = 8.  So the longer piece is 4x = 4 * 8 = 32 feet.  The answer is 32. 
 Ian starts with a 40-foot board.  Let's say the shorter piece is x feet.  Then the longer piece is 4x feet. 

The sum of the two pieces is 40.  So, x + 4x = 40
Combine like terms: 5x = 40
Divide by 5: x = 8

So, the shorter piece is 8 feet long.  The longer piece is 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet long. 

The answer is 32. 
 Let's let the shorter piece be x.  Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, the longer piece is 4x.  We know that the total length is 40, so we can write an equation: 4x + x = 40. 

Combine like terms: 5x = 40. 

Divide both sides by 5: x = 8. 

The longer piece is 4x, or 4 * 8 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
 Let's call the shorter piece x.  The longer piece will be 4 * x.  The total original length is 40.  Since the shorter piece and the longer piece add up to 40, we have the equation x + 4x = 40.  This can be simplified to 5x = 40.  Dividing both sides by 5 gives us x = 8.  So the shorter piece is 8 feet long, and the longer piece is 4 * 8 = 32 feet long.  The answer is 32.

 Aiden wants to make 80 meatballs, and he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat.  So, he needs 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of ground beef.  For each pound of ground beef, he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning.  So, for 5 pounds, he will need 5 x 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.  The answer is 10. 
 Aiden makes 16 meatballs from 1 pound of meat.  He needs 80 meatballs, so he needs 80/16 = 5 pounds of meat.  He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat.  So he needs 5 x 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.  The answer is 10. 
1 pound of meat makes 16 meatballs.  So, 80 meatballs will require 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of meat.  For each pound of meat, 2 tablespoons of seasoning are needed.  So, for 5 pounds of meat, he will need 5 x 2 = 10 tablespoons.  The answer is 10. 
80 meatballs were required.  Since he gets 16 meatballs per pound of meat, he will need 80/16 = 5 pounds of meat.  Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, he will need 5 x 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.  The answer is 10. 
80 meatballs need to be made, and 16 meatballs are made per pound of meat.  So, the number of pounds of meat needed is 80 / 16 = 5.  Since two tablespoons of seasoning are needed for each pound of meat, the amount of seasoning needed is 5 x 2 = 10 tablespoons.  The answer is 10. 
80 meatballs is a lot! But we can solve this problem by breaking it down step by step. 

First, we need to figure out how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will need.  To do this, we can divide the number of meatballs by the number of meatballs he gets from each pound of meat: 80 meatballs ÷ 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of meat. 

Now that we know Aiden needs 5 pounds of meat, we can calculate how much seasoning he'll need.  He adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of meat, so we multiply the number of pounds by the number of tablespoons per pound: 5 pounds × 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons. 

The answer is 10.

5 windows x 35 inches per window = 5 x 35 = 175 inches total width.  Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width.  So he needs 2 x 175 = 350 inches of fabric.  The answer is 350. 
5 windows are each 35 inches wide, so the total width of the windows is 5 x 35 = 175 inches.  Since Luke needs fabric for 2 times the total width, he needs fabric for 175 x 2 = 350 inches.  The answer is 350. 
5 windows with 35 inches each is 5 x 35 = 175 inches.  He needs fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows.  175 * 2 = 350.  The answer is 350 inches. 
 There are 5 windows.  Each window is 35 inches wide.  35 * 5 = 175.  So, the total width is 175 inches.  He needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times that, so he needs 175 * 2 = 350 inches of fabric.  The answer is 350.

0. 25 * 16 = 4, so it would cost $4 for the first 16 minutes.  After that, the cost per minute drops to 0. 2.  So for the remaining 36 - 16 = 20 minutes, it would cost 0. 2 * 20 = 4.  In total, the call would cost 4 + 4 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
0. 25 is the price per minute for the first 16 minutes of the call.  So the cost for the first 16 minutes is 16 x 0. 25 = 4.  For the remaining 20 minutes (36 - 16 = 20), the price is 0. 2 per minute.  So the cost for the remaining 20 minutes is 20 x 0. 2 = 4.  4 + 4 is 8.  The answer is 8. 
 You have to pay $0. 25 per minute for the first 16 minutes, which is 16 x 0. 25 = 4 dollars.  After that, you have to pay $0. 2 per minute for the remaining 36 - 16 = 20 minutes, which is 20 x 0. 2 = 4 dollars.  So in total, you have to pay 4 + 4 = 8 dollars for the call.  The answer is 8. 
 To make the calculation, you need to calculate the cost of the first 16 minutes and the cost of the last 20 minutes.  
The cost of the first 16 minutes would be 16 x $0. 25 = $4.  The cost of the last 20 minutes would be 20 x $0. 2 = $4.

Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, so the number of brownies is 3x - 2. 

There are 5 people in the class, and each person gets 2 treats, so the total number of treats is 5 x 2 = 10. 

The total number of cupcakes and brownies is the sum of the number of cupcakes and brownies: x + (3x - 2). 

Since there are 10 treats in total, we can set up the equation: x + (3x - 2) = 10. 

Combine like terms: 4x - 2 = 10. 

Add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12. 

Divide both sides by 4: x = 3. 

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3. 
 Let's break this down step by step.  Carly makes x cupcakes.  She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies, so she makes 3x - 2 brownies.  We're told that each person gets 2 treats, and there are 5 people in the class, so the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.  Since both cupcakes and brownies are treats, we can set up the equation x + (3x - 2) = 10.  Simplifying this equation, we get 4x - 2 = 10.  Adding 2 to both sides gives us 4x = 12.  Dividing both sides by 4 gives us x = 3.  So Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3.

Then, 50% decrease from $72 means $72 - (50% of $72) = $72 - (0. 5 * 72) = 72 - 36 = 36. 

The price of the toy after it was discounted in January was 36 dollars.  The answer is 36. 
 Since the price increased by 80%, the price in December was 1. 8 times the price in November.  So the price in December was 40 x 1. 8 = 72.  Then, the price decreased by 50%.  The decrease is half of 72, which is 36.  So in January, the price is 72 - 36 = 36.  The answer is 36. 






Let's calculate the price increase in December.  Originally, the price of the toy was $40.  It increased by 80%, so we can find the percentage increase by multiplying by 0. 80.  40 x 0. 8 = 32.  So the price increased to 40 + 32 = 72. 

In January, the price decreased by 50%.  We need to calculate the percentage decrease by multiplying 72 by 0. 5.  72 x 0. 5 = 36.  So the price decreased to 72 - 36 = 36. 

The answer is 36.

[EXP] 831: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 440, [output]:  Charlie's standard fee is 80 dollars per hour.  He has 4 lessons at this rate.  So he earns 80 * 4 = 320 dollars for these lessons.  For the lessons with a veteran, he reduces the rate by 25%.  25% of 80 is 80 * 0. 25 = 20.  So his reduced rate is 80 - 20 = 60 dollars per hour for the other lessons.  He has 2 lessons at this rate.  So he earns 60 * 2 = 120 dollars for these lessons.  In total, he earns 320 + 120 = 440 dollars.  The answer is 440. 
 Charlie has 4 standard rate lessons at 80 dollars each, so that's 4 * 80 = 320 dollars.  Then he has 2 veteran lessons and he reduces his rate by 25%, which means his rate for veterans is 80 - 25% of 80 = 60 dollars.  So the 2 veteran lessons cost 2 * 60 = 120 dollars.  The total is 320 + 120 = 440 dollars.  The answer is 440. 
 Charlie has 4 lessons at standard rate, which is 4 x 80 = 320.  He also has 2 lessons with a veteran.  The veteran rate is 100% - 25% = 75% of the original rate.  The veteran rate is 0. 75 * 80 = 60.  So Charlie makes 2 x 60 = 120 dollars for the veteran lessons.  In total, Charlie makes 320 + 120 = 440.  The answer is 440. 
80 dollars per hour for the 4 regular lessons means 4 x 80 = 320 dollars.  For the 2 lessons with veterans, he will reduce his rate by 25%.  25% of 80 is 25/100 x 80 = 20.  So the rate for veteran lessons is 80 - 20 = 60 dollars.  2 hours at 60 dollars is 2 x 60 = 120 dollars.  The total amount of money he will make is 320 + 120 = 440 dollars.  The answer is 440. 
4 lessons at 80 dollars each will be 4 x 80 = 320 dollars.  Charlie gets 25% less for the two lessons he gives to veterans, which is 80 * 0. 75 = 60 dollars per hour.  So 2 lessons will cost Charlie 2 x 60 = 120 dollars.  320 + 120 is 440.  The answer is 440. 
 Charlie has 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate.  That will be 4 * 80 = 320 dollars.  Then he has 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran.  His rate for a veteran goes down 25% which is 0. 75 of his standard rate.  So his rate for a veteran is 80 * 0. 75 = 60 dollars per hour.  2 hours for 60 dollars each is 2 * 60 = 120 dollars.  The total amount of money he will make for the day is 320 + 120 = 440 dollars.  The answer is 440. 
 Charlie started with 4 1-hour lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.  That's a total of 4 x 80 = 320 dollars.  Then, he had 2 1-hour lessons with a veteran, for whom he reduced his rate by 25%.  To reduce by 25%, Charlie's rate becomes 0. 75 * $80 = $60 per hour.  So the total amount he made from these 2 lessons is 2 x 60 = 120 dollars.  Adding the two amounts, the total Charlie made in one day is 320 + 120 = 440.  The answer is 440.

[EXP] 837: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 84, [output]: 6 grapes were eaten by Madeline.  Then the brother used 5 times as many, which is 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.  So now there are 6 + 30 = 36 grapes left.  Then the mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies.  Each pie requires 12 grapes, so the mother used 12 * 4 = 48 grapes.  Madeline and the brother already ate 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.  So in total, she had 36 + 48 = 84 grapes at the beginning.  The answer is 84. 
 Let's break this down step by step. 

Madeline ate 6 grapes. 

Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make a full glass.  6 * 5 = 30 grapes used by her brother. 

Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies.  A pie recipe calls for 12 grapes, so the number of grapes left is 12 * 4 = 48 grapes used by their mother. 

In total, 6 (Madeline) + 30 (brother) + 48 (mother) = 84 grapes were used.  To find the total number of grapes at the beginning, add the number of grapes used to the number of pies used: 84 grapes. 

The answer is 84. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  Madeline ate 6 grapes.  Her brother used 5 times as many grapes to make a full glass, so he used 5 x 6 = 30 grapes.  Now we subtract the total number of grapes Madeline and her brother used, 6 + 30 = 36 grapes.  Their mother made 4 pies and each pie needed 12 grapes, so she used 4 x 12 = 48 grapes.  The total number of grapes used is 36 + 48 = 84 grapes.  Since we are subtracting 84 from the total number of grapes at the beginning, we need to find the total number of grapes at the beginning.

 Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week.   To make it, he spends $1. 00 on pasta and $3. 00 on cheddar cheese.   He also spends 3 x 2 = 6. 00 on gruyere cheese.  So he spends 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 dollars each time he makes macaroni and cheese.   In one year, there are 52 weeks.  So he spends 52 x 10 dollars.  52 x 10 is 520.  The answer is 520. 
 Bud's annual expenditure can be broken down into the weekly expenditure:

1) Pasta: 1 dollar per week
2) Cheddar cheese: 3 dollars per week
3) Gruyere cheese: 3 * 2 = 6 dollars per week

Total weekly expenditure = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 dollars

Annual expenditure = Weekly expenditure * 52 weeks (in a year) = 10 * 52 = 520 dollars

The answer is 520. 
 Bud spends 1. 00 on pasta.  For cheddar cheese, he spends 3. 00.  For gruyere cheese, he spends 3 x 2 = 6. 00.  So the total cost for one time he makes it is 1 + 3 + 6 = 10. 00.  If he does this once a week, the total cost for one week is 10. 00.  If he does this for one year, he spends 52 weeks * 10. 00 = 520. 00.  The answer is 520. 
1 year has 52 weeks.  Bud makes macaroni and cheese 52 times a year.  The cost of the pasta for one time is 1. 00.  The cost of cheddar cheese is 3. 00.  Gruyere cheese costs twice as much as cheddar cheese, so 2 x 3. 00 = 6. 00.  Total cost of the ingredients for one time is 1. 00 + 3. 00 + 6. 00 = 10. 00.  Total cost for a year is 52 * 10. 00 = 520. 00.  The answer is 520. 
 Once a week, Bud makes macaroni and cheese.  To calculate how much per week, we can add up the cost of the pasta ($1. 00) and the two types of cheese ($3. 00 + $3. 00 * 2 = $3. 00 + $6. 00 = $9. 00).  In total, Bud spends $9. 00 + $1. 00 = $10. 00 per week.  In one year (52 weeks), he spends 52 * 10. 00 dollars.  52 * 10 is 520.  The answer is 520.

Then, in terms of minutes, that is 40 * 60 = 2400 minutes.  The time spent cleaning is 1200 minutes and 2400 minutes is the available time, so the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms is (1200/2400) * 100 = 50%.  The answer is 50%. 
80 classrooms will take 15 minutes each to clean.  So it will take them 15 x 80 = 1200 minutes to clean all 80 classrooms.  Since they have 5 days, they have a total of 5 x 8 = 40 hours of work.  To find the percentage, we need to convert the minutes to hours first.  1200 minutes is 20 hours.  So, they spend 20 hours of their 40 hours of work on cleaning classrooms, which is 20 / 40 = 0. 5 or 50%.  The answer is 50%. 
80 classrooms need to be cleaned, and it takes 15 minutes per classroom.  To find the total number of minutes, multiply the number of classrooms by the time per classroom:

80 classrooms x 15 minutes per classroom = 1200 minutes

The custodian has 5 days to complete the task.  They work 8 hours a day, which is 480 minutes per day (8 hours x 60 minutes per hour). 

To find the total number of minutes they work over the 5 days:

480 minutes per day x 5 days = 2400 minutes

Now, to find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms:

(1200 minutes spent cleaning classrooms ÷ 2400 minutes worked over 5 days) x 100%

= 50%

So, the custodian spends 50% of their day, on average, cleaning classrooms.  The answer is 50%.

Rose originally paid $2. 40 for 12 eggs (since a dozen is 12 eggs).  5 dozens are 60 eggs.  The total cost is 5 x 2. 40 = 12. 00. 

She will sell each set of 3 eggs for $1.  Since there are 60 eggs, that means she will sell them in sets of 3 eggs for 60 / 3 = 20 sets.  Each set for 1 dollar makes a total of 20 dollars. 

The profit will be the amount of money she makes by selling, minus the amount she spent on the eggs.  That is, profit = revenue - cost.  Profit = 20 - 12.  The answer is 8.

[EXP] 844: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 1 bag costs $18 - $3 = $15.  The bag has 30 sticks, so 1 stick costs $15 ÷ 30 = $0. 50 per stick.  0. 50 dollars is 50 cents.  The answer is 50. 
1 bag of beef jerky costs $18 - $3 = $15.  One bag has 30 sticks.  So the cost per stick is $15 ÷ 30 = $0. 50.  Converting this to cents, $0. 50 = 50 cents.  The answer is 50. 
1 bag of 30 sticks is $18. 00.  If there's a $3. 00 discount, the price per bag becomes $18. 00 - $3. 00 = $15. 00.  

To find the cost of 1 stick, we divide the cost of the bag by the number of sticks.  $15. 00 ÷ 30 sticks = $0. 50 per stick.  To convert this to cents, we multiply $0. 50 by 100, since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar.  $0. 50 x 100 = 50 cents per stick.  The answer is 50. 
30 sticks of beef jerky per bag.  If it costs $18. 00 per bag and there's a discount of $3. 00, then the price of the bag is 18. 00 - 3. 00 = 15. 00.  Each bag has 30 sticks of jerky.  So to find the cost per stick, divide the price of the bag by the number of sticks:
15. 00 / 30 = 0. 50
So each stick of jerky will cost 50 cents.  The answer is 50. 
18. 00 is $18. 00 per bag.  Archie gets a discount of 3. 00 dollars, so the actual price is 18. 00 - 3. 00 = 15. 00 dollars.  There are 30 sticks to a bag.  To find the cost of one stick, we divide the cost of one bag by the number of sticks, which is 15. 00 / 30.  15 divided by 30 is 0. 5.  But we want the cost in cents, so we multiply by 100 because there are 100 cents in a dollar.  0. 5 x 100 = 50.  The answer is 50 cents.

[EXP] 845: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  Audrey has to answer 70% of the total questions.  She must correctly answer (70/100) x (70 + 40) questions. 

(70/100) x 110 = 0. 7 x 110 = 77 questions

She already got 0. 6 x 70 = 42 questions correct on the first test.  So, she has to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test. 

The answer is 35. 
 Audrey started with 70 questions to get right on the first test.  She got 60% of them right, which is 0. 6 x 70 = 42.  That means she has 70 - 42 = 28 questions left to get right.  To move on to the 7th grade, she needs to get 70% of the total questions right, and the total questions are the questions on both tests: 70 + 40 = 110 questions.  So 70% of 110 is 0. 7 x 110 = 77.  Since she already got 42 questions right on the first test, she now needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.  The answer is 35. 
70% of the total questions is required for Audrey to move on to the 7th grade.  The total number of questions in both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.  70% of 110 = 0. 7 * 110 = 77 questions. 
She already got 60% of 70 questions on the first test, which is 0. 6 * 70 = 42 questions.  So she has already answered 42 correct questions.  Audry needs to answer 77 - 42 questions correct to get 70% of the total questions.  77 - 42 is 35.  She needs to get 35 questions correct on the second test.  The answer is 35. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  Audrey needs to get 70% correct to move on to 7th grade.  What's 70% of the total questions? Since there are two tests, we need to find the total number of questions.  The first test has 70 questions, and the second test has 40 questions.  The total number of questions is 70 + 40 = 110. 
2.  To find 70% of 110, we can convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 70 ÷ 100 = 0. 7.  Then, multiply the result by the total number of questions: 0. 7 × 110 = 77. 
3.  Audrey got 60% of the first test correct.  What's 60% of 70? Convert the percentage to a decimal: 60 ÷ 100 = 0. 6.  Multiply by the number of questions: 0. 6 × 70 = 42. 
4.  Since Audrey got 42 questions correct out of 70 on the first test, she has 70 - 42 = 28 questions left to get correct.  She needs 77 questions correct overall to move on to 7th grade. 
5.  Audrey doesn't know how many questions she got correct on the first test, so we can't subtract 42 from 77 to find out how many she needs on the second test.  Let's consider the remaining questions on the second test: 40 questions. 
6.  To get 77 questions correct, Audrey still needs 77 - 42 = 35 correct answers on the second test, since she already got 42 correct on the first test. 

The answer is 35.

[EXP] 846: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 96, [output]:  Let's start by saying the number of strawberry cubes is x.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.  We know the total number of ice cubes is 116.  So, we can set up the equation: x + (5x - 4) = 116.  Combining like terms, we get 6x - 4 = 116.  Adding 4 to both sides gives 6x = 120.  Dividing both sides by 6 gives x = 20.  The number of strawberry cubes is 20.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.  The answer is 96. 
 Mary makes some strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.  Let's call the number of strawberry cubes x.  The blueberry cubes are equal to 5x - 4.  So in total, she has x + (5x - 4) = 116 ice cubes.  This equation can be written as 6x - 4 = 116.  Adding 4 to both sides gives us 6x = 120.  Dividing both sides by 6 gives us x = 20.  So Mary made 20 strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4 = 5 * 20 - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96.  The answer is 96. 
 Let's start by using the information that Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and a number of blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  Let the number of strawberry cubes be x. 

Then, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4. 

The total number of ice cubes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes: x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6: x = 20

Now we know that Mary makes 20 strawberry ice cubes. 

The number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4, and substituting x = 20 gives:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry ice cubes. 

The answer is 96. 
 Let's start by using the information that Mary makes some strawberry cubes and some blueberry cubes.  The total number of cubes is 116.  

Let's call the number of strawberry cubes 's'.  Then, the number of blueberry cubes is 5s - 4. 

The total number of cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes: s + (5s - 4) = 116. 

Combine like terms: 6s - 4 = 116. 

Add 4 to both sides: 6s = 120. 

Divide both sides by 6: s = 20. 

We know that the number of strawberry cubes is 20.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, or 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96. 

The answer is 96. 
 Let's start by using a variable for the number of strawberry cubes that Mary makes, say s.  Then the number of blueberry cubes is 5s - 4. 

The total number of ice cubes Mary makes is the sum of strawberry and blueberry cubes.  Since she makes a total of 116 ice cubes, we can set up the equation:

s + (5s - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6s - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6s = 120

Divide by 6:

s = 20

Now we know that Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes.  The number of blueberry cubes is 5 times that minus 4, which is:

5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96

The answer is 96. 
 Let's start by identifying what we know.  Mary makes some strawberry cubes, and the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4.  Let's suppose the number of strawberry cubes is x. 

The blueberry cubes are 5x - 4.  

The total number of ice cubes is 116.  
So, we can set up an equation x + (5x - 4) = 116. 

Combine like terms: 6x - 4 = 116.  Add 4 to both sides: 6x = 120.  Divide both sides by 6: x = 20. 

So the number of strawberry cubes is 20. 
The number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96. 

Mary makes 96 blueberry ice cubes.  The answer is 96.

So he needs 15 x 2 = 30 customers.  If he gets 1 customer for every 25 phone calls, then he needs 30 x 25 = 750 phone calls to get the 30 customers.  The answer is 750. 
 Jason needs to sell 15 cars to earn his bonus.   For every 2 customers into the dealership, one buys a car.  That means for 15 cars, Jason needs 15 * 2 = 30 customers.  For every 25 telephone calls, he gets one customer, so for 30 customers he needs 30 * 25 = 750 telephone calls.  The answer is 750. 
 To find the number of telephone calls, we need to find the number of people Jason needs to call first.  To sell 15 cars, Jason needs 15 / 1 = 15 customers.  For every 2 customers, 1 buys a car.  So he needs 15 / 0. 5 = 30 people to come in.  Since 1 person comes in for every 25 phone calls, Jason needs 30 * 25 = 750 phone calls.  The answer is 750. 
 Jason needs to sell 15 cars.  After two customers come into the dealership, one will buy a car.  So we need to find 15).   We just want to find the number of customers who will buy a car.   The ratio is 2 to 1.   Therefore, Jason needs 2 * 15 = 30 customers who will look at new cars.   Based on historical averages, Jason needs 30 to get these 30 customers.   And 1 out of every 25 phone calls gets one person who will look at new cars.  So 30 / 1 = 25 * x.   This means that 30 is 1/25 of x.   To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 25.   This gives 30 * 25 = 750.   Therefore, 750 phone calls would give Jason the 30 customers to sell 15 cars.   The answer is 750.

 Tim works 6 hours a day for 5 days, so he works 6 * 5 = 30 hours in total.  15 minutes is equal to 1/4 of an hour.  30 hours is 30 * 4 = 120 15 minute intervals.  The answer is 120. 
6 hours a day for 5 days is 6 * 5 = 30 hours.  Each call takes 15 minutes, so we need to convert the total number of hours to minutes first.  Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 30 hours is equal to 30 * 60 = 1800 minutes.  Then, divide 1800 minutes by 15 minutes per call.  This gives us 1800 / 15 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
6 hours a day times 5 days a week is 30 hours.  1 hour is 60 minutes, so there are 30 * 60 = 1800 minutes in a week.  Each call takes 15 minutes.  Dividing 1800 minutes by 15 minutes/call, we get 120 calls.  The answer is 120. 
 Tim works 6 hours a day for 5 days.  The total time he spends at work is 6 * 5 = 30 hours.  It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call, so he deals with 30 * 60 / 15 calls.  (Multiplying 30 by 60 to convert the hours to minutes, and then dividing by 15 to get the number of calls) 30 * 60 / 15 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
 Tim spends 6 hours each day, so 6 x 60 minutes each day = 360 minutes.  It takes him 15 minutes to deal with a call.  To find out how many calls he can do in 360 minutes, we divide 360 by 15: 360 / 15 = 24.  He can make 24 calls. 

Since this is for 5 days, we multiply 24 by 5: 24 x 5 = 120.  Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.  The answer is 120.

 With the old varnish, the coat of varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting.  For 6 paintings, it would take 6 x 7 = 42 minutes. 

With the new varnish, the coat of varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting.  For 6 paintings, it would take 6 x 12 = 72 minutes. 

The difference is 72 - 42 = 30 minutes.  The answer is 30. 
 Generally, it takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting.  For 6 paintings, it would take 6 * 7 = 42 minutes.  With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes per painting.  For 6 paintings, it would take 6 * 12 = 72 minutes.  The difference is 72 - 42 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
 Louise would normally need 7 minutes to dry for each of the 6 paintings, so that is 7 x 6 = 42 minutes.  With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes for each painting, so that is 12 x 6 = 72 minutes.  It will take 72 - 42 = 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.  The answer is 30. 
12 - 7 = 5, so the new varnish takes 5 minutes longer to dry than the old one. 

To find the time it will take to dry 6 paintings with the new varnish, we need to multiply the time per painting by the number of paintings: 6 * 5 = 30 minutes. 

The answer is 30. 
12 minutes is the time for the new varnish to dry on one painting.  But the old varnish took 7 minutes.  So the time difference for one painting is 12 - 7 = 5 minutes.  If it takes 5 minutes longer for one painting, then for 6 paintings it will be 6 x 5 = 30 minutes.  The answer is 30 minutes. 
7 minutes were needed to dry the old varnish on each painting.  So it would take 7 * 6 = 42 minutes for 6 paintings with the old varnish to dry.  12 minutes are needed to dry the new varnish.  To find the difference, we need to subtract 12 from 42.  42 - 12 = 30.  The amount longer it takes for the coat to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish as it would with the old varnish is 30 minutes.  The answer is 30.

4 of Crista's plants need half a cup of water.  That's 4 x 0. 5 = 2 cups.  8 of her plants need 1 cup of water.  That's 8 x 1 = 8 cups.  The rest of the plants (20 - 4 - 8 = 8) need a quarter of a cup of water each.  That's 8 x 0. 25 = 2 cups.  The total amount of water Crista needs every day is 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.  The answer is 12. 
4 of her plants need half a cup of water, so we multiply 4 by 0. 5, which is 2 cups of water.  8 plants need 1 cup of water, so 8 x 1 = 8 cups of water.  The rest need a quarter of a cup of water, but there are still 20 plants, so there are 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants that need a quarter cup of water.  That is 8 x 0. 25 = 2 cups of water.  We add up all the cups: 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 857: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 200 yards is the distance Phineas needs to travel.  Half of it is 200 / 2 = 100 yards on land and the other half is 100 yards in the water.  He will be hopping on land for 100 yards and swimming for 100 yards.  On land, he goes 20 yards per minute.  So it will take him 100 / 20 = 5 minutes to cover the distance on land.  In the water, he goes 10 yards per minute.  So it will take him 100 / 10 = 10 minutes to cover the distance in the water.  In total, it will take him 5 + 10 = 15 minutes to return home.  The answer is 15. 
 The rainstorm flooded the wetlands and washed Phineas Frog 200 yards away from his home in the swamp.  To return home, he will need to hop and swim his way back.  If he hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute, and swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute, how long will it take Phineas, in minutes, to return home if half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water?

Half of the distance is 200 / 2 = 100 yards.  He will hop 100 yards at 20 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 / 20 = 5 minutes.  He will swim the other half (100 yards) at 10 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 / 10 = 10 minutes. 

The total amount of time it will take Phineas to return home is 5 minutes (for hop) + 10 minutes (for swim) = 15 minutes.  The answer is 15. 
200 yards is the total distance Phineas needs to travel.  Half of that is 100 yards.  He needs to hop for 100 yards at 20 yards per minute.  100 / 20 = 5.  So it will take him 5 minutes to hop the first 100 yards.  Then, he needs to swim for another 100 yards at 10 yards per minute.  100 / 10 is 10.  So it will take him 10 minutes to swim the other 100 yards.  To find the total time, add the two together.  5 + 10 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, we need to find the total distance Phineas has to travel.  The distance from his home to where the rainstorm washed him away is 200 yards. 
Half of this distance is 200/2 = 100 yards, which is the distance he needs to travel through water.  The other half is 100 yards, which is the distance he needs to travel on land. 

He swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes to swim the half of the distance through water. 

He hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so it will take him 100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes to hop the half of the distance on land. 

In total, Phineas will take 10 minutes to swim and 5 minutes to hop, so the total time it will take him to return home is 10 + 5 = 15 minutes.  The answer is 15. 
 Let's break the problem down into two parts.  The first part is equal, and the second part is also equal.  200 / 2 = 100.  So the first 100 yards is on land, and the second 100 yards is in water. 
Phineas hops on land at a speed of 20 yards per minute.  100 yards / 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes.  So it takes 5 minutes to hop 100 yards. 
Phineas swims through water at a speed of 10 yards per minute.  100 yards / 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes.  So it takes 10 minutes to swim 100 yards. 
Total time = time to hop + time to swim = 5 + 10 = 15 minutes.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 859: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  There are 5 phones on the plan.  The main phone costs 20 dollars.  There are 4 additional phones, so each of those phones costs 20 / 2 = 10 dollars.  10 * 4 is 40 dollars.  The total cost of the phone plan is the main phone plus the additional phones.  That is 20 + 40 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
 The main phone plan costs $20, which is for the main phone.  The additional 4 phones cost less, so each of them costs half of what the main phone costs.  Since the main phone costs $20, each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10.  There are 4 additional phones, so they cost 10 * 4 = $40.  The total cost is 20 + 40 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
 Let's break it down:

The main phone costs $20.  That's one part of the total cost. 

There are additional phones, which cost less than the main phone.  Each additional phone costs half as much as the main phone, since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone.  So each additional phone costs $20 / 2 = $10. 

There are 4 additional phones (since we're starting with a total of 5 phones).  The total cost of these additional phones is 4 x $10 = $40. 

The total cost of the phone plan is the cost of the main phone plus the cost of the additional phones: $20 + $40 = $60. 

The answer is 60.

10 dozen doughnuts is 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts.  Each doughnut sells for 2 dollars.  So Derrick sells 120 x 2 = 240 dollars of doughnuts every day.  There are 30 days in June.  30 x 240 is 7200 dollars.  The answer is 7200. 
1 dozen doughnuts is equal to 12 doughnuts.  So Derrick makes 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts every day.  He sells them for 2 dollars each, so he makes 120 x 2 = 240 dollars per day.  Since he does this for 30 days in June (30 days in a month), he makes 30 x 240 = 7200 dollars.  The answer is 7200. 
10 dozen doughnuts is 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.  Each doughnut costs 2 dollars, so he sells 120 x 2 = 240 dollars worth of doughnuts each day.  Since there are 30 days in June, 240 x 30 = 7200.  So Derrick makes 7200 dollars in June.  The answer is 7200. 
1 dozen is 12, so 10 dozen is 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts.  Each doughnut is 2 dollars, so all 120 doughnuts would be 120 * 2 = 240 dollars.  Since Derrick sells all his doughnuts, he makes 240 dollars per day.  June has 30 days, so the total amount of money Derrick makes is 240 * 30 = 7200 dollars.  The answer is 7200. 
1 dozen is 12 doughnuts.  So Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts per day.  Selling each doughnut for $2, the total amount Derrick makes in a day is 120 * 2 = 240.  There are 30 days in June, so Derrick's total money made in June is 30 * 240 = 7200.  The answer is 7200.

7 photos per batch and 6 batches per day, that is 7 x 6 = 42 photos per day.  So Jade needs 210 / 42 = 5 days to upload all her photos.  The answer is 5. 
210 photos need to be uploaded.  In one batch, 7 photos are uploaded, so the number of batches is 210 / 7 = 30.  If 6 batches are done each day, then 30 / 6 = 5 days will be needed to upload all of the photos.  The answer is 5. 
210 photos in total.  She uploads 7 photos in one batch, and 6 batches each day.  So each day she uploads 7 x 6 = 42 photos.  Since she has 210 photos, to find out the number of days needed to upload all photos, we can divide 210 by 42.  210 / 42 = 5.  The answer is 5.

The weekly cost is 25 + 6 + 16 = 47.  
In 5 weeks, the total cost will be 47 * 5 = 235.  The answer is 235. 
5 blouses at $5. 00 each will be 5 * 5. 00 = 25. 00.  1 skirt at $6. 00 will be 1 * 6. 00 = 6. 00.  2 pants at $8. 00 each will be 2 * 8. 00 = 16. 00.  In total for one week, Alicia spends 25. 00 + 6. 00 + 16. 00 = 47. 00.  For 5 weeks, she will spend 47. 00 x 5 = 235. 00.  The answer is 235. 00. 
5 blouses cost 5 x $5. 00 = $25. 00
1 skirt costs $6. 00
2 pants cost 2 x $8. 00 = $16. 00
Total cost per week: $25. 00 + $6. 00 + $16. 00 = $47. 00

In 5 weeks, Alicia will spend a total of 5 x $47. 00 = $235. 00
The answer is 235. 00. 
5 weeks means 5 times.  For each week:
- 1 skirt: 1 x 6. 00 = 6. 00
- 2 pants: 2 x 8. 00 = 16. 00
- 5 blouses: 5 x 5. 00 = 25. 00
Total for each week: 6. 00 + 16. 00 + 25. 00 = 47. 00

For 5 weeks, the total cost will be 5 x 47. 00 = 235. 00.  The answer is 235. 
 For one week, the cost of dry-cleaning is $5(5) + $6(1) + $8(2) = 25 + 6 + 16 = 47 dollars.  For 5 weeks, the cost is 47 x 5 = 235.  The answer is 235. 
5 blouses for 5 dollars each will be 5 x 5 = 25 dollars.  1 skirt for 6 dollars is 6 dollars.  2 pants for 8 dollars each is 2 x 8 = 16 dollars.  In total, the cost is 25 + 6 + 16 = 47 dollars.  Since this is a weekly cost, we multiply by 5 because it is for 5 weeks.  47 x 5 = 235.  The answer is 235. 
 The cost of each blouse is 5. 00, so 5 blouses is 5 x 5. 00 = 25. 00.  The cost of the skirt is 6. 00.  The cost of the pants is 8. 00 x 2 = 16. 00.  So the total weekly cost is 25 + 6 + 16 = 47. 00.  For 5 weeks, the cost is 5 x 47. 00 = 235. 00.  The answer is 235. 00. 
 Alicia has to get 5 blouses cleaned each week, so in 5 weeks she will get 5 x 5 = 25 blouses cleaned.  She also gets 2 pants washed each week, so in 5 weeks she will get 5 x 2 = 10 pants cleaned.  She gets 1 skirt washed each week, so in 5 weeks she will get 5 x 1 = 5 skirts cleaned.  The cost for each blouse is $5. 00, so the total cost for blouses is 25 x $5. 00 = $125. 00.  The cost for each pair of pants is $8. 00, so the total cost for pants is 10 x $8. 00 = $80. 00.  The cost for each skirt is $6. 00, so the total cost for skirts is 5 x $6. 00 = $30. 00.

[EXP] 863: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 150 WPM is John's normal speaking speed.  After training, his speed is 150 x 2. 5 = 375 WPM.  He needs to speak 10 x 450 words = 4500 words.  At his new speed, 4500 words will take 4500/375 = 12 hours.  The answer is 12. 
 John started with a speed of 150 WPM.  After training, his speed is 2. 5 times faster, so his trained speed is 2. 5 * 150 = 375 words per minute.  Each page has 450 words, so he can read 450 words in 450 / 375 = 1. 2 minutes.  Since he needs to read 10 pages, it will take him 1. 2 * 10 = 12 minutes.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's first calculate John's new speed after training.  His normal speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).  His new speed is 2. 5 times faster, so it's 2. 5 * 150 = 375 WPM. 

Now, we need to calculate the total number of words in 10 pages with 450 words each.  10 pages * 450 words per page = 4500 words. 

Since John can speak 375 words per minute, we need to divide the total number of words by his speed to find the time it would take him to speak all the words.  4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes. 

The answer is 12 minutes. 
 First, John's starting speed is 150 WPM.  Since his new speed is 2. 5 times faster, his new speed is 2. 5 x 150 = 375 words per minute.  

Each page has 450 words, and we need to find out how many minutes it will take to speak 10 pages.  This can be done by dividing 10 pages x 450 words per page = 4500 words by his new speed of 375 WPM.  

4500 / 375 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
 Let's first find John's new speaking speed.  It is 2. 5 times faster than his normal speed, so his new speaking speed is 150 x 2. 5 = 375 WPM. 

Now, if each page has 450 words, then to find the total number of words in 10 pages, we multiply 450 words by 10 pages: 450 x 10 = 4500 words. 

Now, to find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at a rate of 375 words per minute, we divide the total number of words by John's speaking speed: 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes. 

Therefore, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages if each page has 450 words per page.  The answer is 12.

The rest of the week, he saw an average of 60 people each day.  That is 60 x 3 = 180 people, for 3 days. 
Adding these amounts gives us: 50 + 70 + 140 + 180 = 440 people.  The answer is 440. 
 There are 50 people on the first day.  Then there are 20 more people than on the first day on the second day, so there were 50 + 20 = 70 people.  The third day had twice the number of the second day, which is 70 * 2 = 140 people.  50 + 70 + 140 is 260.  After the first three days, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.  There are 3 days left, so he saw 60 * 3 = 180 people.  The total is 260 + 180 = 440 people.  The answer is 440.

Then 4 times the initial popping rate pops in the next 30 seconds.  4 * 20 = 80, so 80 kernels pop in that time.  In the final 30 seconds, the popping rate is half of the previous 30 seconds.  Half of 80 is 40, so 40 kernels pop in the final 30 seconds.  Now, a quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop from residual heat.  A quarter of 40 is 10, so 10 more kernels pop.  Adding them all up, 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.  The answer is 210. 
1.  There are 20 popper kernels in the first 30 seconds.  Then in the next 30 seconds, 20 * 3 = 60 pop.  Next, in the next 30 seconds, 20 * 4 = 80 pop.  In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate, which is 80 / 2 = 40.  After the final 30 seconds, a quarter of the last 40 poppers pop, which is 40 / 4 = 10.  In total, there are 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels.  The answer is 210. 
 Initially, 20 kernels pop in the first 30 seconds.  

Next, 3 times that amount (20 * 3 = 60) pop in the next 30 seconds.  

Then, 4 times the initial rate (20 * 4 = 80) pop in the next 30 seconds.  

Finally, half of that rate (80 / 2 = 40) pop in the last 30 seconds.  

So, 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200 kernels pop.  

A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds (40 / 4 = 10) also pop from the residual heat.

Garrett has 200 + 10 = 210 kernels to eat.  The answer is 210. 
1.  In the first 30 seconds, 20 kernels popped. 
2.  In the next 30 seconds, the rate is three times the initial rate, which is 3 x 20 = 60 kernels. 
3.  In the next 30 seconds, the rate is four times the initial rate, which is 4 x 20 = 80 kernels. 
4.  In the final 30 seconds, the rate is half the previous rate, which is 0. 5 x 80 = 40 kernels.  But then a quarter of that (40 / 4 = 10) also popped in residual heat. 
5.  To find the total amount of kernels, we add up all four: 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210. 

The answer is 210. 
20 pops in the first 30 seconds.  Then, three times that amount pops in the next 30 seconds, so 20 * 3 = 60 pops.  Finally, four times the initial popping rate, so 20 * 4 = 80 pops, but this is for 30 seconds, so in the last 30 seconds, 80/2 = 40 pops.  After the heat is removed, a quarter of the final 30 seconds pops, which is 40/4 = 10 pops.  So in total Garrett has 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.  The answer is 210. 
 Garrett starts with 20 kernels popping in the first 30 seconds.  He next gets three times that amount in the next 30 seconds.  3 x 20 = 60 kernels.  Then, 4 times the initial rate gives 4 x 20 = 80 kernels in the next 30 seconds.  After that, in the final 30 seconds, the popping rate slows down to half the rate, which is 80/2 = 40 kernels.  Finally, a quarter of the last 30 seconds worth of popping kernels continue to pop from the residual heat, which is 40/4 = 10 kernels.  In total we get 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210 kernels or pieces of popcorn.  The answer is 210. 
 Garrett started with 20 pop in the first 30 seconds.  Then he had 3 times that in the next 30 seconds.  3 times 20 is 60.  So total after 60 seconds, he had 20 + 60 = 80 pop.  In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased and he got 4 times the initial rate.  The initial rate was 20 pop per 30 seconds, so 4 times that is 4 * 20 = 80 per 30 seconds.  So in that 30 seconds, he got 80 pop.  In total, he had 80 + 80 = 160 pop after 1 minute and 30 seconds.  In the last 30 seconds, the popping rate slowed down to half of the previous 30 seconds.  Half of 80 is 40, so he got 40 pop in the final 30 seconds.  After that, a quarter of the final 30 seconds also popped from residual heat.  A quarter of 40 is 10.  40 + 10 = 50.  So a total of 50 pop came in the final residual heat.  Total pop is 160 + 50 = 210.  The answer is 210.

A cup of juice is made from 6 lemons, so 4 cups will need 6 * 4 = 24 lemons. 

Tim also needs to make another gallon that is twice as tart as the others.  This means he will need twice as much lemon juice, which is 2 cups. 

2 cups of juice will require 2 * 6 = 12 lemons. 

In total, he will need 24 lemons for the 4 gallons of regular lemonade and 12 lemons for the extra gallon of lemonade.  So in total, Tim needs 24 + 12 = 36 lemons. 

The answer is 36.

[EXP] 867: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 147, [output]: 3 German Shepherds eating 5 kilograms each will consume 3 x 5 = 15 kilograms per day.  2 Bulldogs eating 3 kilograms each will consume 2 x 3 = 6 kilograms per day.  So together, they will consume 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms of dog food per day.  In a week, they will consume 7 x 21 = 147 kilograms of dog food.  The answer is 147. 
 There are 3 German Shepherds.  Each consumes 5 kg of dog food per day.  So in total they will consume 3 x 5 = 15 kg of dog food per day.  There are 2 Bulldogs.  Each consumes 3 kg of dog food per day.  So in total they will consume 2 x 3 = 6 kg of dog food per day.  So in total the dogs will consume 15 + 6 = 21 kg of dog food per day.  In a week, they will consume 21 kg/day * 7 days = 147 kg of dog food.  The answer is 147. 
 There are 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.  So in total there are 5 dogs.  Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kilograms of dog food per day and each Bulldog consumes 3 kilograms per day.  In total, each day they consume 3 * 5 + 2 * 3 = 15 + 6 = 21 kilograms of dog food.  In a week, they will need 21 * 7 = 147 kilograms of dog food.  The answer is 147. 
 There are 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.  Each day, German Shepherds consume 3 * 5 = 15 kilograms of dog food and Bulldogs consume 2 * 3 = 6 kilograms of dog food.  So the total amount of food needed per day is 15 + 6 = 21. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of dog food needed in a week is 7 * 21 = 147.  The answer is 147. 
 Let's break it down step by step!

* There are initially 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs, so in total there are 3 + 2 = 5 dogs. 
* A German Shepherd consumes 5 kg of dog food per day, and there are 3 German Shepherds, so they need 3 x 5 = 15 kg of dog food per day. 
* A Bulldog consumes 3 kg of dog food per day, and there are 2 Bulldogs, so they need 2 x 3 = 6 kg of dog food per day. 
* In total, the dogs need 15 kg + 6 kg = 21 kg of dog food per day. 
* Since there are 7 days in a week, the dogs will need 7 x 21 kg = 147 kg of dog food in a week. 

The answer is 147. 
 The Kennel house has 3 German Shepherds.  Each German Shepherd consumes 5 kg of food per day, so they consume in total 3 x 5 = 15 kg of dog food per day.  They also have 2 Bulldogs.  Each Bulldog consumes 3 kg of food per day, so they consume in total 2 x 3 = 6 kg of dog food per day.  In total, they consume 15 + 6 = 21 kg of food per day.  They need 7 days of food, so they need 21 x 7 = 147 kg of dog food.  The answer is 147.

[EXP] 869: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 4 blue blocks, and 4 x 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  In total, we have 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks.  There are 32 blocks in total, so the number of red blocks is 32 - 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
4 blue blocks, and twice as many yellow blocks, means there are 2 x 4 = 8 yellow blocks.  In total, there are 4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks.  If the total is 32 blocks, then the red blocks are 32 - 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks means there are 4 x 2 = 8 yellow blocks.  There are 32 blocks in total.  So, the number of red blocks is 32 - 4 - 8.  32 - 12 is 20.  The answer is 20. 
32 blocks in total.  4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks means 2 x 4 = 8 yellow blocks.  4 blue blocks + 8 yellow blocks = 12 blue or yellow blocks.  So the remaining 32 - 12 = 20 blocks must be red.  The answer is 20. 
 Let's start by identifying the number of yellow blocks.  There are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks, and there are 4 blue blocks.  So, there are 4 x 2 = 8 yellow blocks. 

Next, we know that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) + x (red) = 32

We can simplify the equation by combining the constants:

12 + x = 32

Subtract 12 from both sides to get:

x = 20

So, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.  The answer is 20. 
 A tower is made out of 4 blue blocks, twice as many yellow blocks.  That means 2 times 4 = 8 yellow blocks.  4 + 8 = 12 blue and yellow blocks.  There are 32 blocks in total.  So 32 - 12 = 20 blocks must be of another color, which is red.  The answer is 20.

[EXP] 870: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 54, [output]:  Elvis started with 0 miles away from his house.  He travels 5 hours west at 18mph.  So he travels 5 * 18 = 90 miles west.  Then he turns around and travels 8 hours east at 18mph.  So he travels 8 * 18 = 144 miles east.  Overall, he is back at his house, so he is 0 miles away.  The answer is 0. 
5 hours traveling west means a distance of 5 x 18 = 90 miles.  Then, 8 hours traveling east means a distance of 8 x 18 = 144 miles.  The total distance he traveled is 90 + 144 = 234 miles.  Since he traveled the same distance west and then east, he is ultimately 0 miles from his house.  The answer is 0. 
5 hours west at 18mph means he traveled 5 x 18 = 90 miles west.  Then he traveled 8 hours east at 18mph, which means he traveled 8 x 18 = 144 miles east.  In total, he is now back at his starting point, since he moved 90 miles east and then 144 miles west.  So he is 0 miles from his house.  The answer is 0. 
 Let's break the journey into two parts.  The first part is driving west for 5 hours at 18mph.  This means Elvis traveled 5 x 18 = 90 miles west.  Then, he turns around and drives east for 8 hours at 18mph.  This means he traveled 8 x 18 = 144 miles east.  Since he drove 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, he ended up back where he started.  The 90 miles he drove west are cancelled out by the 144 miles he drove east.  The answer is 0. 
 If Elvis travels west for 5 hours at 18mph, the distance he covers is 5 x 18 = 90 miles.  Then he turns around and travels east for 8 hours at 18mph, covering another 8 x 18 = 144 miles.  He has actually come 90 miles away from home and then returned 144 miles, but he's now back where he started.  So the distance from his house now is 0 miles.  The answer is 0.

In the second year, it depreciated another 30%.  30% of 6300 is 0. 3 x 6300 = 1890.  So after the second year, the boat is worth 6300 - 1890 = 4410. 

In the third year, it depreciated 20%.  20% of 4410 is 0. 2 x 4410 = 882.  So after the third year, the boat is worth 4410 - 882 = 3528. 

The answer is 3528. 
 Gary started with a boat worth $9000.  It depreciated 30% the first year.  30% of 9000 is 0. 30 x 9000 = 2700.  So after the first year, the boat was worth 9000 - 2700 = 6300 dollars.  Then it depreciated 30% again.  30% of 6300 is 0. 30 x 6300 = 1890.  So after the second year, the boat was worth 6300 - 1890 = 4410.  Then it depreciated 20%.  20% of 4410 is 0. 20 x 4410 = 882.  So after the third year, the boat was worth 4410 - 882 = 3528.  The answer is 3528. 
30% of 9000 is 0. 30 * 9000 = 2700.  2700 from 9000 is 6300.  The boat depreciated 30% in the first year.   The boat is now worth 6300.  30% of 6300 is 0. 30 * 6300 = 1890.  1890 from 6300 is 4410.  The boat depreciated another 30% in the second year.   The boat is now worth 4410.  20% of 4410 is 0. 20 * 4410 = 882.  882 from 4410 is 3528.  The boat depreciated 20% in the third year.   The answer is 3528. 
9000 is the initial value of the boat.  In the first year, it depreciated by 30%.  To find the amount it depreciated, multiply the initial value by the depreciation percentage:
9000 x 0. 30 = 2700

So the boat is worth 9000 - 2700 = 6300 dollars after the first year. 

In the second year, it depreciated another 30%, so we calculate the depreciation for the second year:
6300 x 0. 30 = 1890

The boat is worth 6300 - 1890 = 4410 dollars after the second year. 

In the third year, it depreciated 20%.  To find the depreciation for the third year:
4410 x 0. 20 = 882

The boat is worth 4410 - 882 = 3528 dollars after the three years. 

The answer is 3528. 
 30% of 9000 is . 3 x 9000 = 2700.  First, subtract 2700 from 9000.   9000 - 2700 is 6300.  The boat is now worth 6300 dollars. 

In the second year, 30% of 6300 is . 3 x 6300 = 1890.  So the depreciation is 1890.  Subtract this from 6300.   6300 - 1890 is 4410. 

In the third year, 20% of 4410 is . 2 x 4410 = 882.  So the depreciation is 882.  Subtract this from 4410.   4410 - 882 is 3528.  The answer is 3528.

Since there are half as many yellow candies as red, that is 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies.  Red + Orange + Yellow = 54 + 108 + 27 = 189.  So 232 - 189 = 43 candies are left to be pink.  The answer is 43. 
232 - 54 - 2 * 54 - 54/2 = ?

There are 54 red candies, 2 times as many orange candies (54 * 2 = 108), and half as many yellow candies as red candies (54/2 = 27).  That's 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies.  If there are 232 candies in total, then there are 232 - 189 = 43 pink candies.  The answer is 43. 
232 candies in total were present originally. 

54 red candies were present. 

Twice the number of red candies means 54 x 2 = 108 orange candies. 

Half as many yellow candies as red means 54 / 2 = 27 yellow candies. 

To find the number of pink candies, subtract the red, orange, and yellow candies from the total:

232 - 54 - 108 - 27 = 43

The answer is 43. 
232 pieces of candy are in the bag.  54 of them are red.  Twice that amount of orange candies means 2 * 54 = 108 pieces of orange candies.  Half as many yellow candies means 54 / 2 = 27 pieces of yellow candies.  Adding it all up, 54 + 108 + 27 are the color candies.  That's 189 candies.  The remaining candies must be pink.  232 - 189 = 43.  The answer is 43. 
232 candies total.  54 are red.  There are twice as many orange candies, so there are 54 x 2 = 108 orange candies.  Yellow candies are half of the red candies.  Half of 54 is 27.  So there are 27 yellow candies.  Finally, 54 + 108 + 27 = 189 candies are some color other than pink.  232 - 189 = 43 are pink candies.  The answer is 43. 
232 pieces of individually wrapped candies in the bag. 

Let's find out how many orange, yellow, and red candies are in the bag:

* Red candies: 54
* Orange candies: Twice the amount of red candies, so 54 x 2 = 108
* Yellow candies: Half as many as red candies, so 54 / 2 = 27

Add up the numbers to find the total number of candies:

54 (red) + 108 (orange) + 27 (yellow) = 189 candies

Now, subtract the total number of candies in the given colors from the total number of candies:

232 - 189 = 43

The answer is 43 candies are pink. 
232 total candies.  We know 54 of them are red.  Twice that, or 54 x 2 = 108, are orange.  Since we want to know how many pink candies there are, let's first find out how many yellow candies there are.  We are told they have half as many yellow candies as red, so 54 ÷ 2 = 27 yellow candies.  So the total number of yellow + orange + red candies is 108 + 27 + 54 = 189.  We subtract this from the total number of candies to find the number of pink candies, 232 - 189 = 43.  The answer is 43.

The total cost of the bus trips is 7 x 8 = 56 dollars.  In total, Helen paid 240 + 56 = 296 dollars.  The answer is 296. 
 Helen paid 80 dollars for one night in the hotel.  Since she stayed for 3 nights, she paid 3 times as much, or 80 * 3 = 240 dollars.  She rode the bus 7 times, and each trip was 10% of the cost of the hotel room, or 0. 1 * 80 = 8 dollars.  So she paid 7 * 8 = 56 dollars for the bus trips.  In total, she paid 240 + 56 = 296 dollars.  The answer is 296. 
 Helen spent 80 dollars for one night at the hotel.  She booked for 3 nights, so she spent 80 * 3 = 240 dollars at the hotel.  During that trip, she rode the bus 7 times.  Each trip cost 10% of the price of one night at the hotel, which is 10% of 80 = 0. 1 * 80 = 8 dollars.  So, she spent 7 * 8 = 56 dollars for the buses.  56 dollars for buses and 240 dollars for hotel is 56 + 240 = 296.  The answer is 296. 
 Helen's total cost for the hotel can be found by calculating the cost for 3 nights: 80 * 3 = 240 dollars.  The cost for 7 bus rides is 10% of 80 dollars.  10% can be written as 0. 1, and 0. 1 * 80 is 8.  So the cost for the bus rides is 8 * 7 = 56.  The total cost of her trip is 240 + 56 = 296 dollars.  The answer is 296. 
 First, I will find how much Helen paid for the hotel.   Helen stayed for 3 nights in the hotel, and one night cost $80.   For 3 nights, she will pay 3 x 80 = 240 dollars.   Then, she rode the bus 7 times.   Every trip was 10% of the cost of one night at the hotel, so each trip was 0. 1 * 80 = 8. 00.   She rode the bus 7 times, so this will be 7 * 8. 00 = 56.   The cost of the hotel and bus travels is 240 + 56 = 296. 00.   The answer is 296.

[EXP] 876: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  First, we calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children:

1200 + 250 + 75 + 75 = 1600 pounds

Since John needs to apply a force that is 1% of the total weight, we multiply the total weight by 0. 01:

1600 x 0. 01 = 16 pounds

The answer is 16. 
 John's car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds.  So the total weight of the car and luggage is 1200 + 250 = 1450 pounds.  The children weigh 75 pounds each, so together they weigh 75 + 75 = 150 pounds.  In total, the car, luggage, and children weigh 1450 + 150 = 1600 pounds. 

We need to find 1% of the weight, which is 1600 x 0. 01 = 16 pounds. 

The answer is 16. 
 Let's find the total weight of the car and its occupants.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage weighs 250 pounds.  So, the total weight of the car and the luggage is 1200 + 250 = 1450 pounds.  The two children weigh 75 pounds each, for a total of 75 + 75 = 150 pounds.  So, the total weight is 1450 + 150 = 1600 pounds.  Then, the force to move the car is 1% of the weight.  1% of 1600 is 0. 01 * 1600, or 16.  The answer is 16. 
 First, let's find the total weight of the objects in the car.  The car weighs 1200 pounds, adding the luggage of 250 pounds makes it 1200 + 250 = 1450 pounds.  Then, adding the weight of the 2 children, 75 pounds each, makes it 1450 + 150 = 1600 pounds. 

The question states that the force to move the car is 1% of the weight.  To find 1%, multiply 1600 by 1%.  1% can be written as a decimal by dividing by 100: 1/100 = 0. 01.  Multiplying 1600 by 0. 01 gives 16. 

The answer is 16. 
 First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children.  The car weighs 1200 pounds and the luggage and children together weigh 250 + 75 + 75 = 400 pounds.  So the total weight of this object is 1200 + 400 = 1600 pounds.  The force it takes to move the object will be one percent of the weight.   One percent is 1% of 1600 is 0. 01 x 1600 = 16 pounds.  The answer is 16.

 To calculate the length of crepe paper James needs, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangle.  The formula to find the perimeter is: Perimeter = 2(Length + Width) = 2(20 + 15) = 2 x 35 = 70 feet.  The answer is 70. 
 The backyard fence is a rectangle, so we need to calculate its perimeter.  The formula for perimeter of a rectangle is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. 

P = 2(20) + 2(15)
P = 40 + 30
P = 70

James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.  The answer is 70. 
 To find the perimeter of the rectangle, we need to add the lengths of all its sides.  The perimeter is the distance around the fence.  So, the perimeter is: 2 * (shorter side) + 2 * (longer side) = 2 * 15 + 2 * 20 = 30 + 40 = 70. 

James needs 70 feet of crepe paper.  The answer is 70. 
 James needs to wrap the fence, which has two long sides and two short sides.  The perimeter of the rectangle is the distance around the fence, which is the sum of its sides.  The perimeter is 20 + 20 + 15 + 15 = 70.  James needs to buy 70 feet of crepe paper to cover the fence.  The answer is 70.

[EXP] 878: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  If Mia is 40 years old, which is younger than Emma, then Emma is 40 + 16 = 56 years old.  The average of their ages is (40 + 56) / 2 = 48.  The answer is 48. 
 Since Mia is 40 years old, and she is younger than Emma, Emma must be 40 + 16 = 56 years old.  To find the average, we add their ages and divide by two: (40 + 56) / 2 = 96 / 2 = 48.  The answer is 48. 
 Since Mia is 40 years old and Emma is 16 years older than Mia, Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56. 

To find the average age, add Mia's age and Emma's age, then divide by 2:

40 (Mia's age) + 56 (Emma's age) = 96

Divide the sum by 2:

96 ÷ 2 = 48

The answer is 48. 
 Let's first find Emma's age.  If Mia is 40 and they are 16 years apart, Emma must be 40 + 16 = 56. 

To find the average age, we add Mia's age and Emma's age and divide by 2.  40 + 56 = 96, and 96 divided by 2 is 48.  The answer is 48. 
 Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can assume Mia's age (40) and Emma's age are in the form Mia + x.  Since they are 16 years apart, we know Emma's age is 16 years older than Mia, so Emma's age is 40 + 16 = 56. 

To find the average of their ages, we can add their ages together and divide by 2: (40 + 56) / 2 = (96) / 2 = 48. 

The answer is 48.

[EXP] 880: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]: 12 people means 12 place settings are needed.  Each place setting needs a dinner plate, a bowl, and a salad plate.  There are 12 dinner plates needed (12 x 6 = 72 dollars), 12 bowls needed (12 x 5 = 60 dollars), and 12 salad plates needed (12 x 4 = 48 dollars).  The total cost will be 72 + 60 + 48 = 180 dollars.  The answer is 180. 
12 people will have 12 x 3 = 36 plates, bowls and salad plates needed.  Dinner plates cost 6 dollars each.  So 12 * 6 = 72 dollars for dinner plates.  Bowls cost 5 dollars each, so 12 * 5 = 60 dollars for bowls.  Salad plates cost 4 dollars each, so 12 * 4 = 48 dollars for salad plates.  The total cost is 72 + 60 + 48 = 180.  The answer is 180. 
12 people means Avery needs 12 dinner plates, 12 bowls, and 12 salad plates.  The dinner plates each cost 6 dollars, so she will spend 12 x 6 = 72 dollars on dinner plates.  The bowls each cost 5 dollars, so she will spend 12 x 5 = 60 dollars on bowls.  The salad plates each cost 4 dollars, so she will spend 12 x 4 = 48 dollars on salad plates.  To find the total amount, add 72 + 60 + 48: 72 + 60 + 48 = 180.  The answer is 180 dollars. 
 Avery is buying 3 pieces of a place setting for each of the 12 people.  So she is buying 3 x 12 = 36 items.  Dinner plates cost $6 each, so 6 x 12 = 72, bowls cost $5 each, so 5 x 12 = 60, salad plates cost $4 each, so 4 x 12 = 48.  To find the total, I will add 72 + 60 + 48 = 180.  The answer is 180.

 Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.  So, half of that is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.  2 hours more than that is 5 + 2 = 7 hours.  The answer is 7. 
1.  First, we need to find out how much time it took Steve.  It took Steve 10 hours.  2.  Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.  3.  It took Anna 2 hours more than half Steve's time, so it took her 2 + 5 = 7 hours.  The answer is 7. 
 First, we can find out how long Steve's time takes.  If Steve worked for 10 hours, then we find half of it.  Half of 10 is 5.  Anna worked 2 hours more than that.  So Anna worked 5 + 2 = 7 hours.  The answer is 7.

After a week, they will eat 40 * 7 = 280 pounds of feed.  Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so the amount left is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds.  The answer is 20. 
5 pigs, each eating 4 pounds of feed twice a day, will eat a total of 5 x 4 x 2 = 40 pounds of feed a day.  In one week, which is 7 days, they will eat 40 x 7 = 280 pounds of feed.  Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed.  So there are 300 - 280 = 20 pounds of feed left.  The answer is 20. 
 Dexter started with 300 pounds of feed.  Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed twice a day, so each pig eats 8 pounds in one day.  For 5 pigs, that is 5 x 8 = 40 pounds of feed per day.  In one week, that would be 40 x 7 = 280 pounds of feed.  300 - 280 is 20.  The answer is 20. 
5 pigs eat 4 pounds of feed each, twice a day, so they eat a total of 5 x 4 x 2 = 40 pounds of feed per day.  There are 7 days in a week, so they eat a total of 40 x 7 = 280 pounds of feed.  He ordered 300 pounds of feed.  After giving 280 pounds to the pigs, he has 300 - 280 = 20 pounds of feed left.  The answer is 20. 
 Dexter started with 300 pounds of feed.  Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, twice a day, which is 4 x 2 = 8 pounds per day, per pig.  There are 5 pigs, so 5 x 8 = 40 pounds of feed per day.  Since there are 7 days in a week, 40 x 7 = 280 pounds of feed are consumed.  300 - 280 is 20.  The answer is 20.

 Let's start by identifying the ages of the siblings:

* The three sisters are all 16 years old. 
* One brother is 12 years old. 
* The other brother is the older brother, and since one of the brothers is half his age (12), that means the older brother is 2 x 12 = 24 years old. 

Now let's add up the ages of all the siblings:

* The three sisters: 3 x 16 = 48
* The two brothers: 12 + 24 = 36
* Total age: 48 + 36 = 84

The answer is 84. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step. 

There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.  Let's start with the sisters.  There are 3 sisters and they are all the same age, which is 16. 

Now, let's look at the brothers.  One of the brothers is 12 years old.  This is stated to be half the age of the older brother.  This means that the older brother is twice as old as the younger brother.  We can represent this as an equation:

Older brother's age = 2 x Younger brother's age
Older brother's age = 2 x 12 = 24

So, the older brother is 24 years old. 

Now, let's find the total age of all siblings.  We have 2 brothers and 3 sisters, so there are 5 siblings in total. 

The ages of the siblings are:
Brother 1: 12 years old
Brother 2: 24 years old
Sisters: 3 x 16 = 48 years old

To find the total age of all siblings, add the ages together:
12 + 24 + 48 = 84

From the medium t-shirts: 8 x 4 = 32 square feet. 
From the large t-shirts: 6 x 6 = 36 square feet. 
Total square feet needed: 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet. 

The answer is 101. 
 To find the total square feet of the quilt, we need to add the square feet of all the shirts used.  

The small shirts are 3 square feet each, and there are 11 of them.  So, the small shirts contribute 11 x 3 = 33 square feet. 

The medium shirts are 4 square feet each, and there are 8 of them.  So, the medium shirts contribute 8 x 4 = 32 square feet. 

The large shirts are 6 square feet each, and there are 6 of them.  So, the large shirts contribute 6 x 6 = 36 square feet. 

In total, the quilt will be 33 + 32 + 36 = 101 square feet.  The answer is 101.

[EXP] 891: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds, which is equal to 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.  A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, so it has 1. 5 times as many seeds.  1. 5 * 36 = 54 seeds.  In total, there are 36 + 54 = 90 sunflower seeds.  The answer is 90. 
3 dozen seeds is 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.  A large sunflower has 50% more seeds, which means it has 1. 5 times the seeds of a small sunflower.  So the large sunflower has 36 * 1. 5 = 54 seeds.  In total, there are 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.  The answer is 90. 
3 dozen seeds is the same as 3 * 12 = 36 seeds.  The large sunflower has 50% more seeds, which is the same as 36 + 36 * 0. 5 = 54.  So the total number of seeds is 36 + 54 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
3 dozen seeds means 3 x 12 = 36 seeds.  A large sunflower has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower, so it has 1. 5 times the number of seeds.  36 x 1. 5 = 54.  In total, there are 36 seeds from a small sunflower and 54 seeds from a large sunflower.  36 + 54 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
 A small sunflower has 3 dozen seeds.  3 dozen is 3 x 12 = 36 seeds.  The large sunflower has 50% more seeds than the small sunflower.  50% of 36 is 0. 5 x 36 = 18.  So the large sunflower has 18 more seeds than the small one.  36 + 18 = 54 seeds.  There are 54 seeds in the large sunflower.  In total, there are 36 + 54 seeds.  36 + 54 is 90.  The answer is 90. 
3 dozen = 3 * 12 = 36 seeds for the small sunflower.  For the large sunflower, 50% more is the same as 150% of 36, or 1. 5 times 36 = 54 seeds.  Together, they have 36 + 54 = 90 seeds.  The answer is 90.

[EXP] 894: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 140000, [output]:  The company produces 5000 chocolate bars per day.  In two weeks, the company will produce 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars.  The company sells each bar for 2 dollars.  So, it will earn 2 * 70,000 = 140,000 dollars.  The answer is 140,000. 
5000 bars are produced in a day.  Since there are 7 days in a week, in a week, 5000 x 7 = 35,000 bars are produced.  Since it is for 2 weeks, the total bars produced will be 35,000 * 2 = 70,000.  Each bar is sold for 2 dollars.  So the total money received will be 70,000 * 2 = 140,000.  The answer is 140,000. 
1 day = 5000 chocolate bars

2 weeks = 2 x 7 = 14 days

So, the company produces 5000 * 14 = 70,000 chocolate bars

Each bar is sold for $2.  So, total money = 70,000 * 2 = $140,000

The answer is 140,000. 
5000 bars per day.  There are 7 days in a week.  So the company produces 5000 * 7 = 35000 bars per week.  The company sells 35000 bars at 2 dollars each.  35000 * 2 = 70000 dollars.  This is per week.  The company does this for two weeks, so the total money is 70000 * 2 = 140,000.  The answer is 140,000.

[EXP] 895: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Jake buys 2 T-shirts.  The original price of each T-shirt is $8, so the total price of the 2 T-shirts is 2 x 8 = 16 dollars.  However, the deal is buy one get one 50% off, so Jake gets one of the T-shirts for half the price, or $4.  The total cost of the 2 T-shirts is then 8 + 4 = 12 dollars. 

The original price of the shoes is $40.  The shoes are 40% off, so we can calculate the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage:

$40 x 0. 40 = $16

So the discount is $16, and the new price of the shoes is $40 - $16 = $24. 

To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

12 dollars (T-shirts) + 24 dollars (shoes) = 36 dollars

The answer is 36.

[EXP] 898: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  To make 1 jar of the mixture, Tim needs:

* 2 pounds of passion fruit: 2 x 6 = 12 dollars
* 1. 5 pounds of jackfruit: 1. 5 x 8 = 12 dollars
* 2 pounds of special honey: 2 x 10 = 20 dollars

The total cost per jar is 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 dollars.  The profit per jar is 50 - 44 = 6 dollars. 

To sell 10 jars, the total cost is 10 x 44 = 440 dollars and the total profit is 10 x 6 = 60 dollars. 

The answer is 60. 
 To make 1 jar, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1. 5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey.  The cost of the ingredients is:
2 pounds of passion fruit = 2 x 6 = 12 dollars
1. 5 pounds of jackfruit = 1. 5 x 8 = 12 dollars
2 pounds of honey = 2 x 10 = 20 dollars
The total cost is 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 dollars. 

Tim sells each jar for 50 dollars, so his profit is 50 - 44 = 6 dollars per jar.  To make a profit for 10 jars, he needs to make 10 x 6 = 60 dollars.  The answer is 60. 
2 pounds of passion fruit will cost 2 * 6 = 12 dollars, 1. 5 pounds of jackfruit will cost 1. 5 * 8 = 12 dollars, 2 pounds of honey will cost 2 * 10 = 20 dollars.  In total, it costs 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 dollars.  For 10 jars, it will cost 44 * 10 = 440 dollars.  Each jar is sold for 50 dollars, so 10 jars will be sold for 10 * 50 = 500 dollars.  The profit is the amount sold minus the cost, so 500 - 440 = 60.  The answer is 60 dollars. 
 We need to first calculate the total cost of making 10 jars of the honey and jam mix.  To make 1 jar, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1. 5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of special honey.  So for 10 jars, the cost is:

2 pounds passion fruit * 6 dollars per pound = 12 dollars
1. 5 pounds jackfruit * 8 dollars per pound = 12 dollars
2 pounds honey * 10 dollars per pound = 20 dollars
Total cost = 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 dollars

To make 10 jars, the total cost is 44 dollars * 10 = 440 dollars. 

Tim sells each jar for 50 dollars, so the total revenue is 10 jars * 50 dollars per jar = 500 dollars. 

The profit is the revenue minus the cost: 500 - 440 = 60 dollars. 
The answer is 60. 
 First, we need to find out how much it costs Tim to make one jar of mix.  To make one jar, he needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1. 5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey.  So, in total, he needs 2 + 1. 5 + 2 = 5. 5 pounds of ingredients.  

For the passion fruit, he needs 2 pounds and it costs 6 dollars per pound, so that is 2 x 6 = 12 dollars.  For the jackfruit, he needs 1. 5 pounds and it costs 8 dollars per pound, so that is 1. 5 x 8 = 12 dollars.  For the honey, he needs 2 pounds and it costs 10 dollars per pound, so that is 2 x 10 = 20 dollars.  

In total, it costs 12 + 12 + 20 = 44 dollars to make one jar of mix.   Since he sells each jar for 50 dollars, his profit per jar is 50 - 44 = 6 dollars.  

To find out how much profit Tim makes selling 10 jars, we need to multiply the profit per jar by the number of jars he sells.  So, his total profit is 6 dollars per jar times 10 jars, which is 6 x 10 = 60 dollars.  The answer is 60.

In total, Matthew will earn 30 + 42 = 72 dollars if he agrees to the offer.  The answer is 72.

[EXP] 904: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day while Nate is away.  Since he is away for 14 days, the dog digs 6 * 14 = 84 holes in total.  After Nate comes home, the dog digs 6 new holes every night, but Nate fills in 9 holes during the day.  This means Nate doesn't fill in the 6 new holes dug by the dog, so he only fills in 9 - 6 = 3 holes every day.  Let's calculate how many days Nate will take to fill in all the holes:

84 holes / 3 holes per day = 28 days

Since we need to know the number of weeks, we can divide the number of days by 7:

28 days / 7 days per week = 4 weeks

The answer is 4 weeks.

* Alexandra raises $430. 
* Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750. 
* Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, and Sarah raises $300, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700. 

To find the total amount they raise, we add up the amounts each girl raises:

$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $700 (Maryam) = $1880

The answer is 1880. 
 Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, so Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750. 

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300, so Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700. 

The total amount of money they raised is the sum of the amounts raised by each girl: $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $1880. 

The answer is 1880.

[EXP] 911: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Aaron is 2 times as fast as Vanessa, so Vanessa must take 2 times as long to complete the same distance.  Since Aaron completed his part in 16 minutes, Vanessa took 2 times that, which is 2 x 16 = 32 minutes. 

The answer is 32. 
 Let's break this problem down step by step.  

Aaron ran 2 times slower than Vanessa.   Vanessa ran 4 miles, so Aaron ran 4/2 = 2 miles. 

Aaron took 16 minutes to complete his part of the race, but he ran 2 miles.  Vanessa must have taken twice as long to complete her part.   16 * 2 = 32. 

The answer is 32. 
 Aaron ran Aaron's part of race in 16 minutes.  Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.  Aaron ran 16 minutes for his part, but Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so her part is twice the rate and so her time will also be twice the time.  So Vanessa's time is 16 * 2 = 32 minutes.  The answer is 32. 
 Since Aaron ran twice as fast as Vanessa, to find Aaron's running distance, we can divide Vanessa's distance by 2: 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.  Since Aaron ran his part of the race in 16 minutes, we can set up a proportion to find Vanessa's running speed:

2 miles / 16 minutes = x miles / t

Where x is Vanessa's distance and t is her time. 

Cross-multiply: 16 x x = 2 x t
Divide both sides by x: 16 = 2t / x
Multiply both sides by x: 16x = 2t

Now we know that Vanessa's time is half of Aaron's time.  Since Aaron took 16 minutes, Vanessa took 16 x 2 = 32 minutes. 

The answer is 32.

200 feet of dock require 200 x 3 = 600 feet of line.  The caretaker already has 6 feet of line.  So he needs 600 - 6 = 594 more feet of line.  The answer is 594. 
 The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, so for 200 feet of dock, he needs 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line.  He already has 6 feet of line, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.  The answer is 594. 
200 feet of dock needs 3 feet of line for each foot of dock.  So the caretaker needs 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line in total.  He already has 6 feet.  So, he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.  The answer is 594. 
200 feet of dock means he needs 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line in total.  He already has 6 feet, so he must buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.  The answer is 594. 
200 feet of dock need 3 feet of line each, so in total it needs 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line.  Originally, the caretaker had 6 feet of line.  To find out how many more feet he needs, we need to subtract the original line from the total line required: 600 - 6 = 594.  The answer is 594.

The answer is 180. 
6 reservations a night, 2 days a week, so the restaurant gets 6 x 2 = 12 reservations a week.  Each reservation gives them a profit of (2 x 5) + 5 = 15 dollars.  12 reservations a week gives them a profit of 12 x 15 = 180 dollars a week.  The answer is 180. 
6 reservations a night for 2 days is a total of 6 x 2 = 12 reservations.  For each reservation, they get 2 meals at $5 each, which is 2 x 5 = 10 dollars, plus a $5 bottle of wine.  So the total amount made for each reservation is 10 + 5 = 15 dollars.  For 12 reservations, they make 12 x 15 = 180 dollars.  

The answer is 180. 
6 reservations a night means 6 x 2 reservations a week since they are open 2 days a week.  6 x 2 = 12 reservations a week.  12 reservations multiply by 2 meals per reservation is 24 meals per week.  24 meals at $5 each is 24 x $5 = $120.  12 reservations multiply by $5 bottle of wine per reservation is 12 x $5 = $60.  $120 + $60 is $180.

So each watermelon was sold for 100 / 50 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2 dollars. 
50 watermelons were bought for $80.  The vendor got a 25% profit.  That means he made an additional 25% of $80, which is 0. 25 x 80 = $20.  So the total amount he got was 80 + 20 = $100.  If he got $100 for 50 watermelons, then the price of each watermelon is $100 / 50 = $2.  The answer is 2. 
 The fruit vendor buys 50 watermelons for $80.  So, for each watermelon, the price is 80 / 50 = 1. 60 dollars. 
Prior to selling them, the fruit vendor is aiming for a profit of 25%.  This means the selling price per watermelon would be 1. 60 x (100% + 25%) = 1. 60 x 1. 25 = 2. 00 dollars.

400 is the original cost.  80% off means 20% of 400 is the discount.  20% of 400 is 0. 2 x 400 = 80, so the discount is 80.  So the radiator cost after discount is 400 - 80 = 320 dollars.  The mechanic took 3 hours at 50 dollars per hour, so he paid 3 x 50 = 150 for installation.  320 + 150 is 470.  The answer is 470. 
 400 dollars is the original price of the radiator.  Then we get 80% off.  To find 80% of 400, we multiply 400 by 0. 80.  400 x 0. 8 = 320.  So the price is 320 dollars.  Now we install the radiator and we need to pay the mechanic 3 hours * 50 dollars an hour.  3 * 50 = 150 dollars.  So in total Mark pays 320 + 150 dollars.  320 + 150 = 470.  The answer is 470.

[EXP] 918: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  If each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, we can set up an equation.  If we let c be the number of chickens and C be the number of cows, then we have 2c + 4C = 70.  We know that c + C = 20.  So 2c + 4(20 - c) = 70.  Simplifying, 2c + 80 - 4c = 70.  So -2c = -10, and c = 5.  The answer is 5. 
20 animals are either chickens or cows.  The total number of legs is 70.  

Legs per animal: 
- Chickens have 2 legs.  
- Cows have 4 legs. 

Let's call the number of chickens X and the number of cows 20 - X. 

Each chicken has 2 legs, so X chickens have 2 * X legs.  Each cow has 4 legs, so 20 - X cows have 4 * (20 - X) legs. 

Total legs = 2 * X + 4 * (20 - X)

We know the total legs is 70, so we can set up the equation:

2 * X + 4 * (20 - X) = 70

Simplifying the equation:

2 * X + 80 - 4 * X = 70

Combine like terms:

-2 * X = -10

Divide by -2:

X = 5

There are 5 chickens.  The remaining 20 - 5 = 15 animals are cows. 

The answer is 5. 
20 animals means 20 legs from the cows.  If chickens and cows have a total of 70 legs, that means the chickens must have 70 - 20 = 50 legs.  Cows have two legs each and chickens have 2 legs each, so we can set up the equation: 2x + 2*20 = 50, where x is the number of chickens.  The equation simplifies to 2x + 40 = 50.  Solving the equation, we get x = 5, which is the number of chickens.  The answer is 5. 
 Since 20 animals are all either chickens or cows, this means 20 animals have 70 legs.  For cows, we know each cow has 4 legs, so the number of cows is 70 - 4k, where k is the number of cows.  And this number of cows should be less than or equal to 20 animals, so 70 - 4k ≤ 20.  Therefore, we can solve the equation 70 - 4k = 20 to find k, which is 15.  So there are 15 cows.  And the remaining animals are chickens, so there are 20 - 15 = 5 chickens.  The answer is 5.

7 pizzas cut into 8 slices each is 7 * 8 = 56 slices in total.  Henry has 3 friends, so there are a total of 4 people to share the pizzas.  To find out how many slices each person gets, divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices per person.  The answer is 14. 
7 pizzas with 8 slices each = 7 x 8 = 56 slices of pizza.  4 people, including Henry, want to share the pizza equally.  56 slices shared by 4 people means 56 divided by 4.  56 ÷ 4 is 14.  The answer is 14 slices of pizza per person. 
 Voted result: 14

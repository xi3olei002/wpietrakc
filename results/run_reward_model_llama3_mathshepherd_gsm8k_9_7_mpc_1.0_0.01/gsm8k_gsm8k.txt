[EXP] 1: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.  Janet eats 3 eggs herself, and uses 4 for muffins.  3 + 4 = 7 eggs, so the remainder is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.  She sells these eggs for $2 each, so she makes 9 x 2 = 18 dollars.   The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 2 bolts of blue fiber is given.  It requires half the amount of white fiber.  So half of 2 is 1, so it requires 1 bolt of white fiber.  In total, it requires 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 70000, [output]:  Josh bought a house for $80,000.  Then he put in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  To find the new value of the house, multiply the original value by 3 (150% is 1. 5, or 3/2).  80,000 x 3 = 240,000.  So the house is now worth $240,000.  His cost was 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000.  The profit is 240,000 - 130,000. 240,000 - 130,000 is 110,000.  The answer is 110,000. 
[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 540, [output]:  James runs 3 sprints per day, and 3 days a week.  So he runs a total of 3 x 3 = 9 sprints per week.  Each sprint is 60 meters, so James runs a total of 9 x 60 = 540 meters per week.  The answer is 540. 
[EXP] 5: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Wendi gives 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. 15 + 25 = 40 cups.  If Wendi has 20 chickens and each chicken gets 3 cups of feed, then the chickens need 3 * 20 = 60 cups of feed.  They already had 40 cups, so they need 60 - 40 = 20 more cups of feed.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 6: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Kylar buys 16 glasses. 8 of them cost the regular price, which is 5 dollars each.  That is 5 x 8 = 40 dollars.  The other 8 glasses cost 60% of 5 dollars each. 60% of 5 is 3 dollars. 3 x 8 is 24 dollars.  So, Kylar needs to pay 40 + 24 dollars. 40 + 24 is 64.  The answer is 64. 
[EXP] 7: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 260, [output]:  We have to work backwards.  Since Seattle has 20 sheep, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, Charleston has 4 x 20 = 80 sheep.   Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so Toulouse has 80 x 2 = 160 sheep. 

In total, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 sheep.  The answer is 260. 
[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, Carla can download 2 GB/minute.  So to find out how long it will take to download the entire file, we need to divide the total file size (200 GB) by the download speed (2 GB/minute). 

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

So it will take Carla 100 minutes to download the file.  Now, 40% of the way through the download, Carla's download is interrupted by a Windows update.  In this case, 40% of the file is downloaded, which is:

(200 GB) x (0. 4) = 80 GB

So Carla has downloaded 80 GB before Windows forces a restart.  After the update, Carla has to start the download from the beginning.   This means she has to download 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB.  

Since Carla's download speed is 2 GB/minute, we need to divide the remaining file size (120 GB) by the download speed (2 GB/minute).  

120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes

It will take Carla 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.   So, in total, the new download time is 100 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (download interruption) + 60 minutes (resumed download) = 180 minutes

The answer is 180 minutes. 
[EXP] 9: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step! 

1.  John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.  This means he drives a distance of 3 x 60 miles = 180 miles. 

2.   He turns around and has 4 hours remaining for going home.   The first 2 hours are spent in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance. 

3.   In the next 30 minutes (0. 5 hours), he drives at 30mph.   This means he covers a distance of 0.  5 x 30 = 15 miles.  

4.    In the remaining 2.  5 hours, he drives at 80 mph.  This means he covers a distance of 2.  5 x 80 = 200 miles.  (Note that he's actually driving 2. 75 hours (2 hours 45 minutes) at 80 mph, but 2.  75 x 80 = 200).  

5.     Now we need to find the total distance.    He started 180 miles away, covered 15 miles in 0.   5 hours, and covered 200 miles in the remaining 2.  5 hours.   Therefore, he is 180 + 15 - 200 = -5 miles away from home. 
[EXP] 10: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 460, [output]:  Eliza gets $10 per hour from the first 40 hours she works. 40 * 10 = 400 dollars.  From the next 5 hours (45 - 40 = 5 hours), she gets an overtime pay of 10 * 1. 2 = 12 per hour. 5 * 12 = 60.  In total, she got 400 + 60 = 460.  The answer is 460. 
[EXP] 11: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 366, [output]: 3 months is involved here. 1st month has 60 downloads.  2nd month has 3 times as many downloads as the first, so it will have 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.  3rd month has downloads reduced by 30%, so 30% of 180 is (180 * 30) / 100 = 54. 180 - 54 is 126.  1st month had 60, 2nd month had 180, and 3rd month had 126.  60 + 180 + 126 is 366.  The answer is 366. 
[EXP] 12: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 694, [output]: 3 dozen donuts cost 68 dollars per dozen, so the donuts were 3 x 68 = 204. 2 dozen mini cupcakes cost 80 dollars per dozen, so the mini cupcakes were 2 x 80 = 160. 6 dozen mini cheesecakes cost 55 dollars per dozen, so the mini cheesecakes were 6 x 55 = 330.  The total cost is 204 + 160 + 330. 204 + 160 is 364, then 364 + 330 is 694.  The answer is 694. 
[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Carlos has to spend 90 dollars to plant the lemon tree.  Then he has to spend 3 dollars a year to water and feed the tree.  For the first year, he will spend 3 dollars, so he will lose 90 - 3 = 87 dollars.  After the first year, he will have 7 lemons to sell, which will earn him 7 x 1. 5 = 10. 5 dollars.   After the first year, he will have 87 - 10 = 77 dollars left.   In the second year, he again spends 3 dollars, so he will have 77 - 3 = 74 dollars left.  He will have 7 more lemons to sell, which will earn him another 10. 5 dollars, so he will be left with 74 - 10 = 64 dollars.  In the third year, he spends 3 dollars again, so he will be left with 64 - 3 = 61 dollars.  He will have 7 more lemons to sell, which will earn him another 10.  5 dollars, so he will be left with 61 - 10 = 51 dollars.   Notice that in the third year, he earned more money than he spent, so this is the year when he starts earning money.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we need to figure out how many she started with.  Let's break this down step by step.  

Let's say she started with x vacuum cleaners. 

She sold a third of x vacuum cleaners at the green house.  This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.  So, in total, she has sold x/3 + 2 = vacuum cleaners.  Now, she has x - (x/3 + 2) vacuum cleaners left.   
Now, she sold half of what was left at the orange house.   This means she sold (1/2)(x - (x/3 + 2)) vacuum cleaners.   

Since she now has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we set up the equation:

x - (x/3 + 2) - (1/2)(x - (x/3 + 2)) = 5

We can simplify this equation:

x - (x/3) - 2 - (1/2)x + 1/2(x/3) + 1 = 5

Combine like terms:

(3x - x)/3 - 2 + 1/2 = 5

(2x)/3 - 2 + 1/2 = 5

Now, let's solve for x. 

First, add 2 to both sides to get:

2x/3 - 1/2 = 7

Next, multiply both sides by 6 to get:

4x - 3 = 42

Now, add 3 to both sides to get:

4x = 45

Finally, divide by 4 to get:

x = 11. 25

So Melanie started with 11 vacuum cleaners.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 15: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% enrolled in contemporary dance.  20% of the initial 20 students is 20/100 * 20 = 4.  So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. 

Remaining students are 20 - 4 = 16. 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz.   25% of 16 is 16/100 * 25 = 4.   So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance. 

Total students in contemporary and jazz are 4 + 4 = 8.  There are 20 - 8 = 12 students left who enrolled in hip-hop.   The answer is 12/20 * 100 = 60%. 
[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 125, [output]:  Let's evaluate the profit for each option:

Option 1: Jewelry
Current price: $5,000
Expected increase: 2. 5% of $5,000 = $125
Total price at the end of the month: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
Profit: $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

Option 2: Electronic Gadgets
Current price: $8,000
Expected increase: 1. 2% of $8,000 = $96
Total price at the end of the month: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096
Profit: $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant would choose the jewelry option to maximize his profit, which would be $125.  The answer is 125. 
[EXP] 17: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  Both trains travel westward for 80 miles.  That means each train has traveled 80 miles.  

2.  Then, both trains travel north for 150 miles.   That means each train has now traveled a total of 80 + 150 = 230 miles.  So, each train has traveled a total of 230 miles in the two days.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 57500, [output]:  Jill is paid $20 per hour as a teacher, and works 35 hours a week.  So, she makes 35 x 20 = 700 dollars per week as a teacher.  As a cheerleading coach, she is paid $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week, so she makes 15 x 30 = 450 dollars per week as a coach.  700 + 450 = 1150 dollars per week.  She works 50 weeks per year.  So her annual salary is 1150 * 50 = 57500.  The answer is 57500. 
[EXP] 19: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 12 eggs make up one dozen. 3 eggs are eaten per omelet. 4 weeks is 4 x 7 = 28 days.  In a day, 1 omelet is eaten. 28 omelets are eaten in 28 days.  28 omelets for 3 eggs per omelet is 28 x 3 = 84 eggs. 84 eggs are eaten in 4 weeks. 84 eggs / 12 = 7 dozen.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 20: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Marissa walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in another hour.  So 4 + 2 = 6 miles in 2 hours.  This leaves 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.   If her average speed for the entire 12-mile hike is 4 miles per hour, then the total time taken should be 12/4 = 3 hours.  Since she took 2 hours to walk the first 6 miles, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.   The speed she should walk the remaining distance is 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 mph.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 21: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 10 liters of orange drink are two-thirds water, and 3/2 of 10 is 15.  Since 10 - 1 = 9 liters of orange drink are remaining, 2/3 of 9 = 6 liters are water. 15 liters of pineapple drink are three-fifths water, and 3/5 of 15 = 9 liters of water.   So, in the remaining 24 liters, there are 6 + 9 = 15 liters of water.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 22: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so Samantha's age is 6 years more than Raymond's age.  Samantha's age is 31, so Raymond's age is 31 - 6 = 25.  Raymond was 23 when his son was born, so his son was born 25 - 23 = 2 years ago.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday.  3 of them bought one DVD each, so that's 3 DVDs.  The next 2 bought 2 DVDs each, so that's another 4 DVDs.   So far, Billy has sold 3 + 4 = 7 DVDs.  The last 3 customers didn't buy any, so he didn't sell any more.  He sold 7 DVDs.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  The candle was burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.  That is 4 hours.  The candle melts 2 centimeters each hour.  So it melts 2 * 4 = 8 centimeters.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 25: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 25% of the original price is the discount. 25% as a decimal is 0. 25.  So the original price is the book's price (19. 50) + the 25% of the book's price. 

Let's say the original price is x.  Then 0. 25x is the discount, so x - 0. 25x is the price Kyle paid.   We know that's 19. 50.   So we need to solve the equation: 

x - 0.  25x = 19. 50


First, we subtract 0.  25x from both sides:

x = 19.  50 + 0.   25x


This simplifies to:

x = 19.  50 / (1 - 0.   25)


So x = 19.   50 / 0.  75


x = 26


So the original price of the book was 26 dollars.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Marie has 50 dollars in total.  The meal, milk, and apples cost:

$12 (meal) + (5 x $3) (milk) + (4 x $1. 5) (apples) = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33

She spent $33 on the meal, milk, and apples.  So she has $50 - $33 left to spend on pizza:

$50 - $33 = $17

Since each box of pizza costs $8. 50, she must have bought:

$17 ÷ $8. 50 = 2

So Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 243, [output]:  Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. 1 pair of shorts costs 16. 50, so 3 pairs of shorts will cost 3 x 16. 50 = 49. 50.  1 pair of pants costs 22. 50, so 3 pairs of pants will cost 3 x 22. 50 = 67. 50.  1 pair of shoes costs 42, so 3 pairs of shoes will cost 3 x 42 = 126.  In total, Mishka spent 49 + 67 + 126 = 242 dollars.  The answer is 242. 
[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.  This means she eats 60 servings in 60 days.  Since there are 15 servings in a carton, she will need 60/15 = 4 cartons.  Each carton costs 4 dollars, so in total she will spend 4 * 4 = 16 dollars.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 29: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 60 miles is the total distance of Henry's bike trip. 20 miles is the distance from the start to his first stop.  The total distance from the start to his second stop is 60 - 15 = 45.  But this is after traveling 20 miles already, so the distance travelled between his first and second stops is 45 - 20 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 104, [output]:  Let's first find the cost of the expensive pair of heels.  If the cheap pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much, then it costs 2 x 33 = 66.  Together, they cost 33 + 66 = 99.  The boots cost 5 dollars more than this, so the cost of the boots is 99 + 5 = 104.  The answer is 104. 
[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 109, [output]:  First, let's break down the problem.  Let's say Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.  The total of their ages is 7x + 11x = 18x.  We know this total is 162, so we can set up the equation 18x = 162.  Dividing both sides by 18, we get x = 9.  So Darrell's age is 7x = 7 * 9 = 63, and Allen's age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.  Now, 10 years from now, Allen's age will be 99 + 10 = 109.  The answer is 109. 
[EXP] 32: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]: 1. 1 friend says 80 jelly beans. 2.  The second friend says 20 more than half the first one. 20 more than half of 80 is 20 more than 40, which is 60.  3.  The third friend says 25% more than the first one.  25% of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20, so the third friend says 80 + 20 = 100.   The average of the three guesses is (80 + 60 + 100) / 3.  80 + 60 + 100 is 240, and 240 / 3 is 80.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 33: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  John takes care of 10 dogs each of which takes 0. 5 hours a day.  So he spends 10 x 0. 5 hours a day.  That is 5 hours a day.  Each week has 7 days.  So he spends 5 x 7 = 35 hours a week taking care of dogs.  The answer is 35. 
[EXP] 34: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  To solve this problem, we can let the number of silver coins be x.  Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is x + 30.  The total number of coins is 110, so we can write the equation x + (x + 30) = 110.  Simplify the equation by combining like terms:  2x + 30 = 110.  Subtract 30 from both sides:  2x = 80.  Divide both sides by 2:  x = 40.   So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.   To find the number of gold coins, add 30 to x:  40 + 30 = 70.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 35: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has.  Since Raymond has 40 jewels and Aaron has 5 more than half of Raymond's jewels, we can find Aaron's jewels by calculating (40/2) + 5.   This is (20) + 5 = 25.  Aaron has 25 jewels.  Now, we know Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.  So, we can find out how many jewels Siobhan has by subtracting 2 from Aaron's jewels.   (25) - 2 is 23.  Siobhan has 23 jewels.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Mike scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes.   In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than in the first 20 minutes.   25% of 4 is 1, so he scored 1 + 4 = 5 in the second 20 minutes.  In total, he scored 4 + 5 = 9 points.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 37: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so for 30 days, he will have 2 x 30 = 60 yogurts.  60 yogurts are 60 / 4 = 15 sets of 4 yogurts.  Each set costs 5 dollars, so he will spend 5 * 15 = 75 dollars.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  John has 13 lego sets and sells them for 15 dollars each.  So first, we find out how much money he earned.  13 * 15 = 195.  Then, he spends 8 video games for 20 dollars each.  That's 8 * 20 = 160.  So he had 195 - 160 = 35 dollars left.  But according to the problem, he had 5 dollars left.  So 35 - 5 = 30.  From here, it's clear that he sold 13 - 30/15 = 13 - 2 = 11 lego sets.   The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 60 miles a week and 3 days a week means John runs a total of 60/3 = 20 miles per day.  He runs 3 hours on the first day, so that is 3 * ? = 20 miles, which means he runs ? miles per hour. 3 * ? = 20, so ?.  = 20/3.  20/3 is 6. 333.  miles per hour on the first day. 

He runs half as much the other two days.  He runs 20 - 6 = 14 miles each of those days.  

John runs 6 * 1 = 6 hours on the first day, 1.  * 2 = 2  hours on the other two days, and 2  hours total.   So he runs a total of 6 + 2 + 2 = 10 hours in a week.  He runs 60 miles in 10 hours.  That is 60/10 miles per hour.  60/10 is 6.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 18, [output]: 1) Let's first find the speed Dana can skip, which is 3 mph. 2) Dana can run at a rate 4 times faster than she can walk, so if v is her walking speed, her running speed is 4v. 3) Dana's skipping speed is half as fast as her running speed, so her running speed is twice her skipping speed, which is 2 x 3 = 6 mph.  4) From this, we can find Dana's walking speed: running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1. 5 mph.  5) Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.  One-third of 6 hours is 2 hours, and two-thirds of 6 hours is 4 hours.  6) So Dana runs for 2 hours, at 6 mph, and walks for 4 hours, at 1 mph.   7) In 2 hours at 6 mph, Dana can travel 2 x 6 = 12 miles.  In 4 hours at 1 mph, Dana can travel 4 x 1 = 4 miles.   8) Adding this together, Dana can travel 12 + 4 = 16 miles in 6 hours.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 41: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.

[EXP] 44: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 48, [output]: 1 bag has 5 servings.  Each serving is 250 calories.  So the total amount of calories in the bag is 5 * 250 = 1250.  If you've already consumed 1800 calories and your target is 2000, you've got 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left to consume.  The bag has 1250 calories.  The ratio of the remaining calories to the total calories in the bag is 200 / 1250 = 1/6. 1/6 of the bag is 300g / 6 = 50g.  So the amount of grams you can eat is 50.  The answer is 50.

The answer is 197. 
[EXP] 48: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 800, [output]:  Let's first find the number of blue ties John bought.  The cost of blue ties per tie is $40, and he spent $200 on blue ties.  So, the number of blue ties is $200 / $40 = 5.  Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, the number of red ties is 5 * 2 = 10.   The price of a red tie is 50% more than the price of a blue tie.  So, the price of a red tie is $40 + (50% * $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.   The cost of 10 red ties is 10 * $60 = $600.  The cost of 5 blue ties is 5 * $40 = $200.  The total cost of ties is $600 + $200 = $800.  The answer is 800.

[EXP] 58: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 83, [output]: 5000 is the bridge's weight limit. 3755 pounds is the combined weight of the driver and empty truck.  The weight of all the boxes will be 15 x ? = ?.  The total weight of the truck, driver, and boxes cannot exceed 5000.  

First, we find out how much weight is left on the bridge's limit after adding the driver and the empty truck. 5000 - 3755 = 1245.  Then we set this equal to the weight of the boxes, which is 15 x ?.  15 x ? = 1245.  To find out how many ?'s, we divide both sides by 15.  ? = 1245 ÷ 15 = 83.  The driver and truck can carry 83 boxes.  Since they start with no boxes, they can have at least 83 boxes.  Therefore, they can have 83 boxes.  The answer is 83.

[EXP] 65: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Sophia has traveled 100 miles so far.  She needed to put in 4 gallons of gas to fill it up again.  Since her tank holds 12 gallons, the remaining capacity is 12 - 4 = 8 gallons.  How far can she drive with 8 gallons?  She knows that she travels 100 miles with 4 gallons.  So she travels 100 / 4 = 25 miles per gallon.   With 8 gallons, she can travel 25 x 8 = 200 miles.  So, in total, 100 + 200 = 300 miles.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 66: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:

Jim watches TV for 2 hours and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. 2 + 1 = 3 hours in total. 

Since he does this 3 times a week, we multiply the total hours by 3: 3 hours * 3 times a week = 9 hours a week.  He does this for 4 weeks, so we multiply by 4: 9 hours * 4 weeks = 36 hours.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 67: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 4 schools are attending the tournament. 4 schools have a girls' team, and 4 schools have a boys' team.  Each team has 5 players.

[EXP] 76: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Luke starts with the top level having 16 square footage.  The next level below will have half of that, or 16 / 2 = 8 square footage.  The level below that will have half of 8, or 8 / 2 = 4 square footage.  And the bottom level will have half of 4, or 4 / 2 = 2 square footage. 

To find the average square footage, we add up all the levels and divide by the total number of levels:

16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30

There are 4 levels.  To find the average, we divide the sum by 4:

30 / 4 = 7.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 77: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 180 days, Cecilia will have to feed the puppy 180 x 1 = 180 cups of dog food.  After the first 180 days, the puppy will continue to eat 2 cups of dog food every day. 1 year has 365 days, so for the remaining days in the year, she will need 365 - 180 = 185 days of 2 cups of dog food. 185 * 2 = 370 cups of dog food.  For the first 180 days, she needs 180 cups of food, and for the remaining 185 days, she needs 370 cups. 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food in one year.  Since each bag has 110 cups, she will need 550 / 110 = 5 bags.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 78: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information we know: Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.  If Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.  If Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.  To find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract David's amount from Raymond's amount: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100 pounds. 
[EXP] 79: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Vincent needs to buy 18 flowers.  We can divide 18 by 3 to see how many packages of 3 he can buy: 18 ÷ 3 = 6.  He can buy 6 packages of 3 flowers for a total of 6 x $2. 50 = $15.  

Now we need to find how much he would pay if he bought 18 flowers one by one, which is the same as dividing 18 by 2 to find how many packages of 2 he can buy: 18 ÷ 2 = 9. 9 packages of 2 flowers would cost 9 x $1 = $9.  The difference in cost is $15 - $9 = $6.   The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 80: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]: 100 - (30% of 100)

[EXP] 84: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 600, [output]:  We will solve this problem step by step.  There are 3 rose bushes.  Each has 25 roses.  So in total there are 3 * 25 = 75 roses.  Each rose has 8 thorns.   There are 75 roses, so in total there are 8 * 75 = 600 thorns.  The answer is 600. 
[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's first identify the information provided: The team played 22 games, and they won 8 more than they lost.  This information can be represented as:

 Wins + Losses = 22

We know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so let's represent the number of losses as x.  Then, the number of wins would be x + 8.  We can rewrite our initial equation:

x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 7

So the team lost 7 games.  To find the number of wins, we can use the stated relationship: Wins = Losses + 8.  Since the team lost 7 games, we can substitute x = 7:

Wins = 7 + 8
Wins = 15

The team won 15 games.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 87: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  The alarm rang 4 times when it first went off.  The second time it went off, it rang 4 * 3 = 12 times.  The third time it went off, it rang 12 / 2 = 6 times.  The alarm rang 4 + 12 + 6 = 22 times.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 88: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 9360, [output]:  Sylvie's initial annual salary is $600.  After 5 years of service, her salary increases by 10% of $600, which is $60.  So her new salary is 600 + 60 = 660.  After another 3 years of service, she will again receive a 10% increase.   10% of 660 is 66.  So, her new salary will be 660 + 66 = 726.  The answer is 726. 
[EXP] 89: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 8000, [output]:  Let's start with the information that Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's.  This means that if Harald sold 'x' copies, Marilyn sold 10*x copies. 

We also know that the total copies sold is 88,000.  Therefore, we can set up the equation:

10*x + x = 88,000

Combine like terms:

11*x = 88,000

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 8,000

So Harald sold 8,000 copies.  The answer is 8,000. 
[EXP] 90: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 24, [output]: 16 friends and 1/4 of them don't show up, so that means there are 16 - 16/4 = 16 - 4 = 12 actual guests.  Since the gift bag needs are . 75 per guest, the total number of gift bags needed would be 12 x . 75 = 9 gift bags.  Each gift bag costs 2 dollars, so Christina will spend 9 x 2 = 18 dollars.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 91: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 225, [output]:  Ted wants to feed 20 adult dinosaurs, who each eat 10 lbs of potato salad.  That is 20 x 10 = 200.  Then, there are also 5 child dinosaurs, who eat half as much as the adults.  Since an adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs, a child dinosaur eats 10/2 = 5 lbs.  5 child dinosaurs eating 5 lbs each is 5 x 5 = 25 lbs.  So in total, Ted needs to bring 200 + 25 = 225 lbs of potato salad to the picnic.  The answer is 225. 
[EXP] 92: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Since Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 2 more which is 4 + 2 = 6 pets.  Since Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.  In total, Cindy, Marcia, and Jan have 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 93: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's start by knowing that James is 10 and is 1 year younger than Corey, so Corey is 10 + 1 = 11.  Since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, Amy is 11 - 2 = 9.  Since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.  So Gerald ran it in 38 + 2 = 40 seconds originally.  Since his speed improved 10%, we can calculate his new time like this: 40 - (40 * 0. 10) = 40 - 4 = 36 seconds.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 95: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 348, [output]:  Let's think step by step.  We know the number of dogs.  There are 60 dogs.  We know that for every dog, there are 2 cats.  So the number of cats is 2 x 60 = 120.  The number of dogs + the number of cats = 60 + 120 = 180.  The problem tells us that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats.  This means that the number of rabbits = 180 - 12 = 168.   The question asks how many pets in total, so we add up the number of rabbits + dogs + cats.   168 + 60 + 120 = 348.  The answer is 348. 
[EXP] 96: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 2/5 of 200 Grade 5 students are boys. 2/5 * 200 is 80 boys. 200 - 80 = 120.  So there are 120 Grade 5 students that are girls. 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout.  2/3 * 120 = 80.  So there are 80 girls in the girl scout.  The girls who are not in the girl scout are 120 - 80 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 97: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Harry slept 9 hours last night. 2/3 of 9 is 9 * (2/3) = 6.  Harry slept 9 hours and James slept 6 hours.  9 - 6 is 3.  Harry slept 3 more hours than James.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 98: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Since the sauce started from canned tomatoes that lost half their volume, let's first find the original amount of canned tomatoes before they were cooked.  The canned tomatoes lost half their volume, so the original amount must be 2 times the amount of sauce.  2 x 32 = 64 ounces.  Each can is 16 ounces, so to find the number of cans Freda used, we divide 64 by 16.  64 ÷ 16 = 4.  Each can contains 3 tomatoes, so to find the total number of tomatoes, multiply the number of cans by 3.  4 x 3 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 99: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 30 cars were originally on the motorway.  5 cars did not go through the traffic jam, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars did go through the traffic jam.  In total, 20 + some number of cars went through the traffic jam.  The number of cars that went through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is unknown, and will be denoted by x. 

The number of cars that went through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes + the number of cars that went through the traffic jam in the remaining 15 minutes is 25.  So we can write the equation:

x + 20 = 25

To solve for x, we subtract 20 from both sides:

x + 20 - 20 = 25 - 20

x = 5

The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 58, [output]:  Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges. 2 * 40 is 80, so she has 80 potted plants. 18 new potted plants were added yesterday. 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants she has in total. 1 potted plant was given away from each of the 40 window ledges. 1 * 40 is 40 potted plants given away. 98 - 40 = 58.  The answer is 58. 
[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 175, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell.  If the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times and the second friend pressed it 1/4 more times, then the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 20/4 = 25 times. 

Then, let's find out how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell.   The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.   If the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, then the third friend pressed it 60 + 10 = 70 times. 

Finally, we can add up the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell to get the total number of times the doorbell rang.   The first friend pressed it 20 times, the second friend pressed it 25 times, the third friend pressed it 70 times, and the fourth friend pressed it 60 times.  So, the total number of times the doorbell rang is 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175 times.  The answer is 175. 
[EXP] 102: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total number of pages Solo has to read:

Science: 4 pages, Social Studies: 20 pages, History: 7 pages, Geography: 8 pages
Total pages: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday. 39 - 15 = 24 pages are left to read.  Since there are 4 more days, Solo needs to read 24 / 4 = 6 pages each day.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  There are 7 days in a week, but John has a weekend, so we can separate it into weekdays (Monday to Friday) and weekends. 

5 weekdays: John drinks 3 glasses of water per day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), so that's 5 x 3 = 15 glasses of water. 

Weekends (2 days): John doesn't drink water with dinner, so he drinks only 2 glasses of water on Saturday and Sunday, for a total of 2 x 2 = 4 glasses of water. 15 glasses of water for weekdays + 4 glasses of water for weekends = 19 glasses of water.  

The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 104: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 140, [output]:  Since the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can divide the total distance of 42 miles by 3 to find out how many times the fog bank needs to cover the distance: 42 / 3 = 14.  Since the fog bank needs to cover the distance 14 times, it will take 14 x 10 = 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.  The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 500, [output]: 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. 1/4 of the pieces are placed, so 1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces are placed. 1000 - 250 = 750 remaining pieces. 1/3 of the remaining pieces are placed, so 750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces are placed. 750 - 250 = 500 pieces left to be placed.  The answer is 500. 
[EXP] 106: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Amir eats 5 cookies. 3 times as many as Amir must be 3 x 5 = 15. 5 + 15 = 20.  They eat 20 cookies in total.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 72, [output]:  To find the total inner volume of the 3 boxes, we need to find the volume of one box and then multiply it by 3.  To find the volume of one box, we need to subtract the walls from the dimensions. 

Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches, and the walls are 1 inch thick.   So, the inner dimensions of the box are 4 inches by 5 inches by 3 inches.  The volume of the box is the product of these dimensions: 

4 * 5 * 3 = 60 cubic inches.  Now, we multiply this volume by 3 to find the total inner volume of all 3 boxes:

60 * 3 = 180 cubic inches.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Frankie watched TV after he finishes his homework every night.  On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night.  So he watched a total of 2 x 1 = 2 hours of TV.  On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show.  Since he watched 7 hours in all, we subtract the 2 hours on Monday and Tuesday from the total: 7 - 2 = 5 hours.  On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.  So that is 1. 5 hours so far.   On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes.   So that is 2  hours, for a total of 5.  7 hours.   Since we know the total hours is 7, Frankie must have watched 1 30-minute episode on Wednesday.  So the answer is 1. 
[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as he made last year, and ended up making 15 more than he intended.  Let's call the number of cookies he made last year x.  So this year, he meant to make 2x cookies, but actually made 2x + 15 cookies.  Let's use the information given about the total number of cookies: 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 (because 5 cookies were dropped)

2.  Solve for 2x + 15 - 5 = 110:  2x + 10 = 110.  Subtract 10 from both sides: 2x = 100.   Divide both sides by 2: x = 50

3.  The problem asks how many cookies Henry baked last year, which is represented by x.  So the answer is 50. 
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  If the person buys 10 gallons of gas and each gallon costs $3, the total cost will be 10 x 3 = $30.

[EXP] 111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Let's calculate the total number of fruit rolls both of them ate.  Beatrice's roll-ups are 2 wide and 24 long.   That is 2 * 24 = 48 fruit rolls.  Marcell's roll-ups are 3 wide and 14 long.  That is 3 * 14 = 42 fruit rolls.  Together they ate 48 + 42 = 90 fruit rolls.  To get the average, you divide the total rolls by 2.  90 / 2 is 45.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Julia is taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, so the number of liters of water taken on is equal to the number of 10-foot sections rowed, times 2.  Let's find the number of 10-foot sections rowed.  In 16 seconds, Julia rowed 20 feet.  So in 64 seconds, she will row 64 / 16 * 20 = 80 feet.  The number of 10-foot sections rowed is 80 / 10 = 8.  So she took on 8 * 2 = 16 liters of water by the time she reached shore.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 4 teachers in total use the whiteboard.  Each teacher uses it 2 times a day, so they use it 4 x 2 = 8 times a day in total.  If the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson, then the whiteboard is cleaned 3 x 8 = 24 times in a day.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Ryan plants 2 flowers a day.  So for 15 days, he planted 2 x 15 = 30 flowers. 5 did not grow, so he had 30 - 5 = 25 flowers.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1.  Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs in total. 
2.   His phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.   So, Brittany's phone can hold 1800 ÷ 6 = 300 photographs. 300 is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

Now, set up an equation to solve for the number of birds:  Number of birds = 300 ÷ 50. 

Number of birds = 6.  So, the photograph has 6 ducks in it.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 116: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 1st, Sasha has 10 boards that cost her $10 each. 10 * 10 is 100.  She also has 5 boards that cost her $16 each.  5 * 16 is 80.  So, in total she bought lumber worth 100 + 80 = 180.  The price of the lumber has gone up by 50%.  This means she can sell each 2x4x10 board for $15 and each 4x4x10 board for $24. 10 * 15 is 150. 5 * 24 is 120.  So she can sell her lumber for 150 + 120 = 270.  To find her profit, subtract what she spent from what she made: 270 - 180 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13.  Together, that is 7 + 13 = 20.  We know there are 120 total spoonfuls, and we can make 20 units with this ratio.   So, we can divide the total by 20 to find how many times we can use this ratio: 120/20 = 6.  Then, the number of spoonfuls of sugar is 7 out of the 20, so it is 6 * 7 = 42.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 118: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]:  John buys 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children.  So he buys 2 x 3 = 6 pairs of shoes.  Each pair costs 60 dollars.  6 x 60 = 360.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  There are 2 containers with 5 vehicles each initially. 2 x 5 = 10.  After more containers are brought in, there are 30 vehicles in total.  So, there must have been 30 - 10 = 20 more vehicles brought in.  The next day, containers were brought in with 5 vehicles each, so it must have been 20 / 5 = 4 more containers.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 4 years ago, Adrien's salary was 40000, and Lylah's was 30% less. 40000 - 40000 * 0. 3 = 40000 - 12000 = 28000. 4 years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. 40000 * 1. 4 = 56000.  Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage.  28000 * 1. 4 = 39200.  To find their total salaries, we add Adrien's and Lylah's salaries.  56000 + 39200 = 95200.  The answer is 95200. 
[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Since Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week, and a pad has 30 sheets of paper, he uses 2 x 30 = 60 sheets of paper a week.   Since there are 4 weeks in a month, he uses 4 x 60 = 240 sheets of paper a month.  The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so she brought a total of 5 + 8 = 13 fruits. 

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so he brought 5 * 2 = 10 apples. 

Kael also brought half the number of oranges than Morisette, so he brought 8/2 = 4 oranges.  In total, Kael brought 10 apples + 4 oranges = 14 fruits.  Morisette and Kael have 13 + 14 = 27 fruits in total.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 123: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.  Then for the next two days, she slept 2 hours less.  So she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.  6 * 2 = 12 hours.  Then for the remaining days she slept 1 hour more than those two days.  So 6 + 1 = 7 hours per day.  7 * 3 = 21 hours.  The total hours she slept is 8 + 12 + 21 = 41.  The answer is 41. 
[EXP] 124: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Rosie runs 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. 10 x 3 = 30 miles.  She runs 5 miles per hour afterwards for 7 - 3 = 4 hours. 5 x 4 = 20 miles. 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 125: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Jennie is helping with 60 letters.  She puts stamps on one-third of them.  One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20.  That means 20 letters got stamps.  Now there are 30 letters in the pile with stamps.  So before, there were 30 - 20 = 10.  This tells us how many letters were already stamped when she began.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 126: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Julia started with an unknown number of spoons, then bought a new package, then got 5 more from her husband, so in total she had (number of spoons she started with) + (new package she bought) + 5.  Then she used 3 spoons, leaving her with (number of spoons she started with) + (new package she bought) + 5 - 3 spoons.  Now, she has a total of 12 spoons, so (number of spoons she started with) + (new package she bought) + 5 - 3 = 12.  We don't know the number of spoons Julia started with, so let's call it x.  Then the equation becomes x + (new package she bought) + 5 - 3 = 12.  Simplifying, x + (new package she bought) + 2 = 12.  Substracting 2 from both sides, x + (new package she bought) = 10.   The new package she bought is the thing we're trying to figure out, so let's call it y.   So the equation is x + y = 10.   Since Julia had 12 spoons in the end, subtracting 5 spoons from her husband and 3 used, we know she had 12 - 5 - 3 = 4 spoons to start.  So x = 4.   Substituting x = 4, x = 4 + y = 10, so y = 10 - 4 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages means 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages. 38 chicken sausages + 44 fish sausages = 82 sausages.  The answer is 82.

The doctors charge $150 per hour, so the hospital spends 200 * 150 = $30,000.  The hospital charges $200 per hour, so the hospital earns 200 * 200 = $40,000.  The profit is 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000.  The answer is 10,000. 
[EXP] 131: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 60 elves were originally hired. 60/3 is 20, so 20 elves quit after being covered in vomit. 60 - 20 = 40. 10 more elves quit, so 40 - 10 = 30. 30 elves are left.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 132: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 940, [output]:  Joseph's expenditure in May was $500.  His expenditure in June was $60 less.  That means his expenditure in June was $500 - $60 = $440.  The total expenditure for 2 months is $500 + $440 = $940.  The answer is 940. 
[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  both Pam and Fred rode the roller coaster.  Pam rode the roller coaster 2 times and Fred rode it 4 times, so together they rode it 2 + 4 = 6 times. 6 times is 6 x 6 = 36 tickets spent on the roller coaster.  Then, after that, each of them rode the luge 2 times, so 2 + 2 = 4 times in total. 4 times is 4 x 6 = 24 tickets spent on the luge.   Total tickets used is 36 + 24 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 6 times that would be 6 x 4 = 24 miles on Tuesday. 4 + 24 = 28 miles so far. 41 - 28 is 13 miles. 13 miles is how far Walt walked on Wednesday.  The answer is 13.

[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]: 1. 2 subs: 2 x 7. 50 = 15. 00
2.  2 bags of chips: 2 x 1. 50 = 3. 00
3. 2 cookies: 2 x 1.  00 = 2.  00

The cost of the food is 15.  00 + 3.  00 + 2.  00 = 20.   00. 

Then, there is a 20% delivery fee, so 20. 00 * 0. 20 = 4. 00.  20. 00 + 4.   00 = 24.   00

Finally, we add a 5.   00 tip, so 24.   00 + 5.   00 = 29.

In the second test, Mark had 100 questions.  He has 6 hours to complete 5 questions per hour.  6 * 5 = 30.  So he completed 30 questions of the second test. 100 - 30 = 70 questions left.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 140: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  There are 12 blue gumballs.  There are 22 more pink gumballs than four times the number of blue gumballs.  So we need to find four times the number of blue gumballs and then add 22 to get the number of pink gumballs.  Four times 12 is 4 x 12 = 48.  There are 22 more pink gumballs than 48, so the number of pink gumballs is 48 + 22. 48 + 22 = 70.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 141: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20 cars are available. 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, so together that is 12 + 4 = 16. 16 cars are either automatic or manual, so 20 - 16 = 4 must be semi-automatic.  To find the percentage, we divide 4 by 20 and multiply by 100.  The answer is 20%. 
[EXP] 142: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 400, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

Let W be the number of worker bees, B be the number of baby bees, and Q be the number of queens.  We know there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so W = 2B.  We also know there are twice as many babies as queens, so B = 2Q. 

The total number of bees is 700, so W + B + Q = 700.  Substituting the equations for W and B, we get:

2B + B + Q = 700

This simplifies to 3B + Q = 700.  

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute that into the equation:

3(2Q) + Q = 700

Expanding the equation, we get:

6Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms:

7Q = 700

Divide both sides by 7:

Q = 100

Since B = 2Q, we can substitute Q into B:

B = 2(100)

B = 200

And finally, since W = 2B, we can substitute B into W:

W = 2(200)

W = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees!.  The answer is 400.

	- Cups: 3 dollars (non-food item, 10% tax)
	- Roach traps: 4 dollars (non-food item, 10% tax)

Let's calculate the tax for non-food items:
	- Light bulbs: 3 dollars * 10% = 0. 3 dollars = 30 cents
	- Cups: 3 dollars * 10% = 0. 3 dollars = 30 cents
	- Roach traps: 4 dollars * 10% = 0.  4 dollars = 40 cents

Now, let's add the prices and taxes together:
	- Milk and eggs: 2 + 3 = 5 dollars (no tax)
	- Total non-food items: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10 dollars
	- Total tax: 30 cents + 30 cents + 40 cents = 1 dollar
	- Total cost: 5 dollars (milk and eggs) + 10 dollars (non-food items) + 1 dollar (tax) = 16 dollars

The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 1st, let's find out how much Kim will spend on cleaning supplies for all 8 clients (3 existing + 5 potential). 8 clients will need 8 x 2 = 16 bottles of bleach, which will cost 2 x 16 = 32 dollars. 8 clients will need 8 x 1 = 8 packs of cloths, which will cost 5 x 8 = 40 dollars.  In total, Kim will have to spend 32 + 40 = 72 dollars on supplies.  Kim has a total income of 92 dollars each week.   Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses.  92 - 72 = 20.  The answer is 20.

And another one with 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece one, which is 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.  In total, there are 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.   The answer is 2125. 
[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours. 1/2 that many return in the next 6 hours. 1/2 of 30 is 15.  So 15 return in the next 6 hours.  Then she sees 2 times the bees leave that left in the first 6 hours.  2 times 30 is 60.  60 bees leave the hive during the next 6 hours.  Finally, 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours, but didn't return yet, come back to the hive.  So in total, 15 bees return in the last 6 hours.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 150: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook.  He has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so Dorothy must have 12 divided by 3 = 4 friends.  James has 4 times as many friends as Dorothy, so James has 4 x 4 = 16 friends.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 151: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's first calculate how long it takes Steve to get home from school.   Steve lives 3 miles from school.  There are 5280 feet in 1 mile, so Steve lives 3 x 5280 = 15,840 feet away.  He can bike at 440 feet per minute.  To find out how many minutes it takes him to get home, divide 15,840 by 440.  15,840 / 440 = 36.   Steve will get home in 36 minutes.   Let's do the same for Tim.  Tim lives 2 miles away.  Again, there are 5280 feet in a mile, so Tim lives 2 x 5280 = 10,560 feet away.   He can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute.   To find out how many minutes it takes Tim to get home, divide 10,560 by 264.   10,560 / 264 = 40.  Tim will get home in 40 minutes.  Since Steve will get home in 36 minutes and Tim will get home in 40 minutes, it will take the loser 40 - 36 = 4 minutes to arrive after the winner has arrived at their house.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 152: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire. 5 people came by with bicycles, and each bicycle has 2 tires, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 tires.  3 people came by with tricycles, and each tricycle has 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.  1 person came by with a unicycle, which has 1 tire.  So in total, 10 + 9 + 1 = 20 tires got inflated.  20 tires cost 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents.  500 cents is equal to 5 dollars.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 153: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Carl purchased 10 packs of cookies.  Each pack has 6 cookies.  So, Carl has a total of 10 x 6 = 60 cookies.

[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 48, [output]: 5

To solve this problem, we can start by identifying the events and the number of fries involved in each:

1.  Dave ate 14 fries. 
2.  The seagull gobbled down half the amount of fries that Dave ate, so the seagull ate 14/2 = 7 fries. 
3.  The three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so in total they ate 3 x 3 = 9 fries.  After the seagull and pigeons, the number of fries remaining is 14 + 7 - 9 = 12. 4.   The raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries, so he stole 12 * (2/3) = 8 fries.  Now there are 12 - 8 = 4 fries left.  5.   One ant carried off a french fry, then there are 4 - 1 = 3 fries left.  Finally, 5 fries are left.  

We know that 5 fries are left.  But we are trying to determine how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.  If we go back through the steps, noting how many fries were removed after each event, we see that the hypotenuse (the starting number of fries) minus all the removed fries equals the 5 fries remaining.  To solve, we can:

- Start with x, the number of french fries when Dave bought the pack.  
- After Dave ate 14, there are x - 14 fries left.  The seagull gobbled 7 fries, so after that, there are x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 fries left.  The pigeons ate 9 fries, so after that, there are x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 fries left.  The raccoon stole 8 fries, so after that, there are x - 30 - 8 = x - 38 fries left.   Finally, one ant ate one fry, leaving x - 38 - 1 = x - 39 fries behind.  We know there are 5 fries left, so that means:

x - 39 = 5

Solving for x, we get:  x = 44.  So there were 44 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.  The answer is 44. 
[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 272, [output]:  Kimo has 3 one-hour classes each on mondays, wednesdays, and fridays.  That is a total of 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 one-hour classes per week, or 9 hours per week.  On tuesdays and thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes each day.  That is a total of 2 + 2 = 4 classes, or 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week. 

So, in one week, he has 9 hours of one-hour classes and 8 hours of two-hour classes.  That is a total of 9 + 8 = 17 hours per week.  In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school.  So he would spend 16 x 17 = 272 hours going to school this semester.  The answer is 272. 
[EXP] 156: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 280, [output]:  Let's start by converting all the lengths into the same unit, feet.  

Each roll is 4 inches long, which is 1/3 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 4 inches is 1/3 of that).  

Rolls: 300 * 1/3 = 100 feet

Each croissant is 6 inches long, which is 1/2 feet (since 1 foot = 12 inches, 6 inches is 1/2 of that).  

Croissants: 120 * 1/2 = 60 feet

Each baguette is 2 feet long. 

Baguettes: 60 * 2 = 120 feet

Now, add up the total length:

100 + 60 + 120 = 280 feet

So, the total length of the baked goods will be 280 feet.  The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1400, [output]: 2 months means we need to calculate for 2 months. 2 months is the same as adding 1 month to itself, so we just need to calculate the order for 1 month and multiply it by 2. 1 month, the zookeeper will feed apes as follows:
- Monkeys: 200 bananas per month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas per month
- Baboons: 100 bananas per month

Total bananas needed per month = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 bananas

So the zookeeper needs to order 700 bananas per month. 2 months will be 700 x 2 = 1400 bananas.  The answer is 1400. 
[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's first figure out how much Blake ran.  Blake runs back and forth 15 times, so he runs a total of 15 * 2 * 100 = 3000 yards.  Now, let's figure out how much Kelly ran.  Kelly ran once back and forth to the 40 yard line and back, which is 80 yards.  She did that 34 times, so she ran a total of 80 * 34 = 2720 yards.   To find out who the winner is, we need to compare the number of yards ran by each person.  First, we subtract Kelly's distance from Blake's distance:

3000 - 2720 = 280

The winner ran 280 yards farther than the loser.  The answer is 280.

[EXP] 162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many fish Anakin caught.  He caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.  So Anakin caught a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.  Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.  Locsin caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so Locsin caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.   Locsin caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so Locsin caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.  In total, Locsin caught 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.  To find the total number of fish that they caught, we add the number of fish caught by each of them: 19 + 13 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 163: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 92, [output]: 20 + 20% of 20 = 20 + 4 = 24.  After 2 months, the price will be $24.  By 36 months, we have 18 intervals of 2 months.  So the price will increase 18 times.   Each time the price increases by 20% of the original price, which is $4.  18 * 4 = 72, so the total increase is 72.  Adding this to the original price of 20 we get 20 + 72 = 92.  So the price of a bag of marbles after 36 months is $92.  The answer is 92. 
[EXP] 164: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Firstly, let's figure out how much the doll cost.  The doll cost as much as 3 action figures.  If one action figure costs $5, then 3 action figures cost 3 x $5 = $15.  Since the doll costs the same as 3 action figures, the doll also costs $15.  One red car costs $4, so all the red cars together cost 5 x $4 = $20.   All together, the total cost of toys is $20 (for cars) + $15 (for doll) + 3 x $5 (for action figures) = $20 + $15 + $15 = $50.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Seth is twice as old as Brooke.  Let's assume Brooke's current age is x.  Then Seth's current age is 2x.  In 2 years, Seth will be 2x + 2 and Brooke will be x + 2.  The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (2x + 2) + (x + 2) = 28.   We can combine the terms and simplify the equation:  3x + 4 = 28.  Subtract 4 from both sides:  3x = 24.  Divide both sides by 3:  x = 8.   So Brooke is currently 8 years old, and Seth is currently 2x = 16 years old.   The answer is 16.

[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 150, [output]:  The hat costs 25 dollars. 3 times this amount is 3 x 25 = 75. 75 is the cost of the jacket.  To find the cost of the pants, we need to take the average of the costs of the hat and jacket.  To calculate the average, we need to add the costs together and divide by 2: 25 + 75 = 100, then 100 / 2 = 50.  So the pants cost 50 dollars.   To find the total cost of the uniform, we add together the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants: 25 + 75 + 50 = 150.  The answer is 150. 
[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1210, [output]: 80 spiders have 80 * 8 = 640 legs. 90 insects have 90 * 6 = 540 legs.  There are 3 invertebrates with 3 * 10 = 30 legs.  So in total, the number of legs is 640 + 540 + 30 = 1210.  The answer is 1210. 
[EXP] 173: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 51, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, and Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.  Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 x 8 = 16 years old.  Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old. 

The ages of the birds are: 8, 8, 16, and 19.  To get the total age, we add these numbers: 8 + 8 + 16 + 19 = 51.  The answer is 51.

Credit card: $200/month, 50% of which is $100, so $200 + $100 = $300.  12 months x $300/month = $3,600.   Additional debt for credit card. 

Mortgage: $500/month, 50% of which is $250, so $500 + $250 = $750.  12 months x $750/month = $9,000.  Additional debt for mortgage. 

Jessica pays a total of  $5,400 + $3,600 + $9,000 = $18,000 in a year.  The answer is 18,000. 
[EXP] 175: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 95, [output]: 60 potatoes. 60 potatoes to peel and cut up for potato salad.  Each pota.  5 seconds to cut each potato, so to cut 60 potatoes takes 60 * 5 = 300 seconds.  Each potato takes a minute and a half to peel, so to peel 60 potatoes takes 60 * 90 = 5400 seconds.  In total it will take Billy 5400 + 300 = 5700 seconds.  There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5700 seconds is 5700/60 = 95 minutes.  The answer is 95 minutes. 
[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  First, let's figure out how much it cost to make each gallon of lemonade.  It cost $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so $5 in total.  Each gallon produces 20 glasses, which they sell for $0. 50 each, for a total of $10 from each gallon.  Since they spend $5 and make $10, they make a profit of $5 per gallon.  We know they made a profit of $25 in total, so they must have made 25/5 = 5 gallons of lemonade.  Since it cost $3 for lemons per gallon, they spent a total of 5 * 3 = 15 dollars on lemons.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 177: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 80 were Japanese, and the rest were Chinese. 240 - 80 = 160. 160 were Chinese. 160 out of which 60 were boys.  So there are 160 - 60 Chinese girls. 160 - 60 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 178: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 350, [output]:  First, let's find out how much Zaid has left after spending on rent and car fuel.  He earns 6000 dollars a month.  He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, so he spends 1/4 * 6000 = 1500 dollars on rent.  He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, so he spends 1/3 * 6000 = 2000 dollars on car fuel.  That means he has 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500 dollars left. 

Then, he donates half of this amount to his favorite charity, so he donates 2500 / 2 = 1250 dollars to his charity. 

After donating 1250 dollars, he has 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars left.  He then gives his daughter 200 dollars and his wife 700 dollars, for a total of 900 dollars.  So he now has 1250 - 900 = 350 dollars left.  The answer is 350. 
[EXP] 179: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 122, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many crabs Monic has.  Since Bo has 40 crabs and Monic has 4 fewer, Monic has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.  Since Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic, Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.  To find the total number of crabs the three have, add up the number of crabs they have: 40 (Bo) + 36 (Monic) + 46 (Rani) = 122.  The answer is 122.

[EXP] 182: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Sandra orders 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. 200 pink calla lilies are 5 times the number of white carnations.  So, if x is the number of white carnations, 4x is the number of red roses and 5x is the number of pink calla lilies. 5x, which is the number of pink calla lilies, is 200.  So, 5x = 200.  Solving for x, we get x = 40.  There are 40 white carnations.   So, 4x = 4 * 40 = 160 red roses were ordered.  The answer is 160. 
[EXP] 183: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Yes!.  Let Mark's age be M.   Since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Jean's age is M + 2.   Two years ago Mark was M - 2.   The problem tells us that two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age.   Jan's age now is 30, so 2 years ago, Jan's age was 28.  So, we can set up this equation:

M - 2 = 5 + 28/2

The 28 divided by 2 is 14, so the equation becomes:

M - 2 = 5 + 14

M - 2 = 19

Add 2 to both sides:

M = 21

Since Mark is 21, Jean's age is 21 + 2 = 23.  The answer is 23.

The other team's legs are; 60 seconds, 57 seconds, 54 seconds, and 51 seconds.  So their total time for the relay is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.  The well-rounded team is 222 - 220 = 2 seconds faster than the less well-rounded team.  The answer is 2 seconds. 
[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]: 1) The chance that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3: There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of a total of 6 outcomes. 3/6 is 1/2 = 50%. 

2) The chance to roll two even numbers in a row:There are 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6).  The probability to roll the first even number is 3/6 = 1/2 = 50%.   To roll the second even number, there are now only 2 even numbers since one has been rolled.  The probability of this is 2/5 = 40%.  Since these two events are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 50% x 40% = 20%.  

3) The difference between 50% (rolling a number greater than 3) and 20% (rolling two even numbers in a row) is 50 - 20 = 30.  So the answer is 30%.

[EXP] 187: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents. 10 cages of hamsters received straw at 5 pieces each, which is a total of 10 x 5 = 50 pieces. 20 pieces were given to the rabbits. 160 - 50 - 20 = 90.  So the remaining 90 pieces of straw must be given to the rats.  Rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. 90 pieces must be equally divided among these 3 cages, so each cage gets 90 / 3 = 30 pieces of straw.  Rats are given 6 pieces each of straw.  To get the number of rats in each cage, we need to find how many rats it takes to divide 30 pieces evenly among them.  Rats are given 6 pieces each, so we need to find how many 6's fit into 30.  30 / 6 = 5.  So there are 5 rats in each cage.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 106, [output]:  Mandy owes Benedict 100 dollars to start with.  

After one month, she will owe 100 * (1 + 0. 02) = 102 dollars.  After another month, she will owe 102 * (1 + 0. 02) = 104. 04 dollars.  After the last month, she will owe 104.  04 * (1 + 0.  02) = 106.  08 dollars. 

So in total, Mandy owes Benedict 106.  08 dollars.  The answer is 106. 
[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 20 dollars per bag to buy and 2 dollars per bag to transport makes the total cost to purchase and transport each bag 20 + 2 = 22 dollars.  If the bags are sold for 30 dollars each and a profit of 400 dollars is made, then 30 - 22 = 8 is the amount of profit per bag.   400 / 8 = 50, so there were 50 bags sold.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 190: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]: 3 friends went to the fair and spent 20. 25 dollars on 3 tickets. 20. 25 / 3 tickets = 6. 75 dollars per ticket.  So, they spent 6. 75 * 3 = 20. 25 dollars on the tickets.  They also spent 4. 50 less on food.  So food costs 20. 25 - 4.  50 = 15.  75.  So, they spent 15.  75 dollars on food. 

They also went on 2 different rides, which cost 33 dollars per ride.   33 * 2 = 66.  00.   So they spent 66.  00 on rides.  

Total cost: 20.  25 (tickets) + 15. 75 (food) + 66.   00 (rides) = 102. 
[EXP] 191: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]:  John collects peaches for 3 hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.  John collects 2 peaches per minute.  To find how many peaches he collects, we multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches collected per minute: 180 * 2 = 360.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 192: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 3. 5 pounds of insects for each week for 10 ducks. 3. 5 * 10 = 35.  They need 35 pounds in total. 35 pounds for the whole week, and we want to know how much they need per day.  We have 7 days in a week, so we divide 35 pounds by 7 days.  35 ÷ 7 = 5.  So the ducks need 5 pounds of insects per day.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 193: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 91, [output]:  Tom starts with 50 trees. 

He plants 10 trees each year, but chops down 2 trees each year.  So the net addition of trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.  Since this happens for 10 years, he adds 8 * 10 = 80 trees.   So he has 50 + 80 = 130 trees. 30% of the trees die.  To find 30% of 130, we can find 10% of 130 (which is 13) and multiply by 3.  130 - 39 = 91.  The answer is 91. 
[EXP] 194: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Sue started with 18 pink flamingos.  Then on Saturday, 1/3 of the flamingos were taken back and painted.  1/3 of 18 is 6, so 6 flamingos were taken back.  Then 6 white flamingos were added to the front yard.  So there are 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.  Then on Sunday, 18 more pink flamingos were added.   So in total there are 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos.   There are 30 - 6 = 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 195: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Violetta is buying 5 crayons for $2 each. 2 x 5 = 10. 10 dollars will be spent on crayons. 20 - 10 = 10.  Violetta started with $20 and will spend $10.  Violetta will have $10 in change.  The answer is $10. 
[EXP] 196: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 1 pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.  So the cost of 1 pen is the sum of the costs of a pencil and an eraser.  A pencil costs $1. 20 and an eraser costs $0. 30.  So, 1 pen costs $1. 20 + $0. 30 = $1. 50.  We are asked how much 8 pens will cost.   The cost of 8 pens is 8 times the cost of 1 pen.  8 * $1.  50 = $12.   The answer is \$12. 
[EXP] 197: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 200 pounds of carrots are given to 40 restaurants. 40 restaurants each get 2 pounds of carrots. 40 x 2 = 80 pounds. 200 - 80 = 120 pounds. 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 198: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6277, [output]: 23786 people are living in Soda. 8417 of them are men, and 9092 of them are women. 8417 + 9092 = 17509.  The remaining people are kids.  So the number of kids is 23786 - 17509 = 6277.  The answer is 6277. 
[EXP] 199: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 320, [output]: 1.  Elaine started with 20 Pokémon cards. 

2.  After a month, she collected three times that number.  20 x 3 = 60.  So she collected 60 cards.  Adding those to the original 20, she now has 20 + 60 = 80 cards.  In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. 60 - 20 = 40.  So she collected 40 cards.  She now has 80 + 40 = 120 cards. 

3.   In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months.   The first two months combined is 80 + 40 = 120.  Twice that is 120 * 2 = 240.  So she collected 240 cards.   Adding these cards to the 120 she already has, she now has 120 + 240 = 360 cards.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 200: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7500, [output]:  Let's break this problem down:

Mark edits 1000 sentences per week.  He edits an equal number for each publisher, so he edits 500 sentences for each publisher.  Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so for 500 sentences, he gets 500 x 5 = 2500 cents.  Publisher B pays twice what Publisher A pays, so they pay 2 x 5 cents = 10 cents per sentence.  For 500 sentences, he gets 500 x 10 = 5000 cents.   The total amount he makes in a week is 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents.  The answer is 7500. 
[EXP] 201: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 55, [output]: 5 liters are in each pail and he gets 5 pails in the morning, so that is 5 x 5 = 25 liters in the morning. 6 pails in the afternoon, each with 5 liters, is 6 x 5 = 30.  25 + 30 = 55 liters in total.  The answer is 55. 
[EXP] 202: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 114,200, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  First, John got a one-time monetary reward of $5000, which is a bonus.   His regular salary is $2000 per week, and he works a full year.   In total, he made $2000 per week for 52 weeks in a year, so he made 2000 x 52 = 104,000. 

The 5% raise applies to his regular salary, not the one-time bonus.   So, his new salary is 1. 05 x 2000 = 2100 per week.  His gross income from his salary for the year is 2100 x 52 = 109,200.  In total, John made 109,200 + 5000 = 114,200.  The answer is 114,200. 
[EXP] 203: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 10 acres * 5 tons per acre = 50 tons of grapes. 50 tons of grapes * 2 barrels per ton = 100 barrels of wine.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 204: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Let's start with the sandwiches: 5 days a week, 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, so that's 5 x 2 = 10 slices of cheese.  Then, for the omelets: he ate omelets for 3 days, with one slice of cheese more than the sandwich, so that's 3 x (2 + 1) = 9 slices of cheese.  Then, for the big dish of macaroni and cheese, he used 8 slices of cheese.  Now, let's sum them all up: 10 + 9 + 8 is 27 slices of cheese.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 205: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 98, [output]:  We need to find out how many blue and red pens Janet bought first. 6 bags of blue pens with 9 pens in each bag will be 6 x 9 = 54 pens. 2 bags of red pens with 6 pens in each bag will be 2 x 6 = 12 pens. 54 blue pens and 12 red pens are 54 + 12 = 66 pens.  Janet now has 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens.  22 + 10 = 32.  The total number of pens Janet had initially were 32 green and yellow pens. 66 blue and red pens were added to this total.  32 + 66 = 98.  The answer is 98. 
[EXP] 206: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 98, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1.  Mr.  Bert allows students to remove the lowest  score.   Brinley  has 5 scores so far: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.   The lowest score is 71.   She will remove this score. 

2.   The average will be calculated on 4 scores.  The remaining scores are: 89, 92, 100, and 86.    The sum of these scores is: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367. 

3.    She needs an average of 93.  There are 4 scores, so the total needed is 4 x 93 = 372. 

4.  Since the sum of the remaining scores is 367, she needs an additional score to get to 372.  372 - 367 = 5.  Therefore, she needs a score of at least 5 to get an average of 93.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 207: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 860, [output]: 25 kilometers x 5 times a week = 125 kilometers a week. 4 weeks will be 4 x 125 = 500 kilometers. 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each will be 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers. 3 weeks will be 120 x 3 = 360 kilometers.  500 + 360 is 860 kilometers.  The answer is 860. 
[EXP] 208: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2600, [output]:  Since we know that each chocolate bar weighs 40g, and each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar, which is 20g.  There are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples.  So the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000g.  The total weight of the candied apples is 80 * 20 = 1600g.  To find the total weight, add the weights of the chocolate bars and the candied apples: 1000 + 1600 = 2600g.  The answer is 2600. 
[EXP] 209: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 76, [output]:  Rose started with 4 cakes on Monday.  Tuesday, she bought 3 times as many, which is 4 x 3 = 12.  Wednesday, she bought 5 times as many as Tuesday, which is 12 x 5 = 60.  So she bought 4 + 12 + 60 cakes in total.   4 + 12 + 60 is 76.  The answer is 76. 
[EXP] 210: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 145, [output]: 20 dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each. 
First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates: 6 x 6000 = 36,000. 
Then, 20 dozen cups cost 36,000 - 1200 = 34,800. 
Finally, we need to find the cost of one cup.  There are 12 cups in a dozen, so 20 dozen is 20 x 12 = 240 cups.  The total cost is $34,800, so the cost of one cup is $34,800 ÷ 240 = $145.  The answer is $145. 
[EXP] 211: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's first calculate how much Sara wants to buy:
The jacket is 30 dollars. 2 pairs of shoes are 20 x 2 = 40 dollars.  In total, she needs 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  She already has 10 dollars saved up.  She will need 70 - 10 = 60 dollars more.  She earns 5 dollars each time babysitting, so to find how many times she needs to babysit, we can divide 60 by 5:
60 divided by 5 is 12.  She needs to babysit 12 times to earn 60 dollars.  She earns 4 dollars each time mowing the lawn.  To figure out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we can divide 60 by 4:
60 divided by 4 is 15.   She needs to mow the lawn 15 times to earn 60 dollars.  She does not need to mow the lawn.   She only needs to babysit the kids.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 212: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Jerry collects 42 eggs.  If the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, then the total number of eggs can be written as:

3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

where x is the number of red chickens and x + 2 is the number of white chickens (since there are two more white chickens than red chickens).  Rearranging the equation and solving, we get:

3x + 5x + 10 = 42
8x + 10 = 42
8x = 32
x = 4

So Jerry has 4 red chickens.  The number of white chickens is x + 2, which is 4 + 2 = 6.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 213: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  The park is a rectangle, so we can find the perimeter of the park first.  The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the park.  To find the perimeter, we add up all the sides: 2*(1. 5) + 2*(6) = 3 + 12 = 15 miles.  Since Gary walks at 3 miles/hour, we can divide the total distance by the speed: 15/3 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 214: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]: 1.  Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store on the first day.  On the next day, she counts 50 more customers than the first day, so she counts 100 + 50 = 150 customers.   The total number of customers by the third day was 500, so the third day, she must have counted 500 - 100 - 150 = 250 customers.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 215: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 4 minutes ago, the small pool had some amount of water, let's call it x.  The big pool had twice as much water, so it had 2x. 4 minutes ago, the combined amount of water in both pools was (x) + (2x) = 3x gallons. 

Now, the big pool has 4 times as much water as the small pool.  Let's say the small pool has y gallons of water now.  Then, the big pool has 4y gallons of water.  The total amount of water in both pools now is (y) + (4y) = 5y gallons. 

Since 4 minutes have passed, both pools have had their leaks emptying at 4 gallons per minute.  So, in 4 minutes, the small pool has lost 4 gallons and the big pool has lost 8 gallons.  So, the combined amount of water lost by both pools is 12 gallons. 

Let's set up an equation to model this situation.   The combined amount of water lost from the two pools in 4 minutes is the difference between the total amount of water now and the total amount of water 4 minutes ago.  So, we can write an equation: 

5y - 3x = 12

We can solve this equation to find the amount of water in the small pool y.  Let's subtract 3x from both sides: 

5y = 12 + 3x

Then, divide both sides by 5: 

y = (12 + 3x) / 5

We don't have enough information to find the exact value of x or y, but we can find the relative amount of water in each pool.   We can plug in the information given: 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.   So, the big pool had 2x and the small pool had x.   The total amount of water in both pools was then 3x.  Since 4 minutes later, the big pool had 4 times as much water as the small pool, the big pool must have 4y and the small pool must have y.   

Now, we can set up an equation using the total amount of water 4 minutes ago: 

3x = y + (2x)

Combine like terms: 

3x = x + y

Subtract x from both sides: 

2x = y

Now, we can plug this back into our first equation: 

y = (12 + 3x) / 5

Substitute y with 2x: 

2x = (12 + 6x) / 5

Multiply both sides by 5: 

10x = 12 + 6x

Subtract 6x from both sides: 

4x = 12

Divide both sides by 4: 

x = 3

Now, y is 2x, which is 6.  The small pool now has 6 gallons of water.  

The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 216: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 44, [output]:  Lori wants to buy a pair of shoes and a matching belt that costs 320 + 32 = 352 dollars.  She makes 8 dollars an hour.  To find out how many hours she needs to work, divide the total amount by her hourly wage: 352 / 8 = 44.  The answer is 44. 
[EXP] 217: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 220, [output]: 10% of $2000 is $200.  So Janeth has to return $2000 + $200 = $2200.  After 12 months, she paid $165 * 12 = $1980.  $2200 - $1980 = $220.   The answer is $220. 
[EXP] 218: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  There are 4 roses in the vase.  There are 7 more dahlias than roses, so there are 4 + 7 = 11 dahlias.  4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 219: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  First we need to find Adrian's age and Zack's age. 3 times Harriet's age is Adrian's age, and Harriet is half of Zack's age.  Since Harriet's age is 21, Adrian's age is 3 x 21 = 63.  Since Harriet is half of Zack's age, Zack's age is 2 x 21 = 42.   So their ages now are 21, 42, and 63.   In three years, they will be 24, 45, and 66.   To find the average, we add the three ages and divide by 3.  24 + 45 + 66 = 135.  135 divided by 3 is 45.  So the average of their ages in 3 years is 45.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 220: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 54, [output]: 4 students scored a total of 251 points.  Naomi scored 68 points.  So far, that is 68 points.  Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.  Half of 68 is 34, so Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44.  So far, 68 + 44 = 112 points.  Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so she scored 68 + 17 = 85.  So far, 112 + 85 = 197 points.   Since the total points are 251, Jojo must have scored the rest of the points: 251 - 197 = 54.  The answer is 54.

To go to Rochester by bus will take 6 days.   It takes half as many days to go by car, half of 6 is 3 days.  To go by bus and then car will take 6 days plus 3 days, 6 + 3 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 227: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 33, [output]: 1. 
Let's calculate the number of cards James has.  
He originally had 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type.  So in total he had 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.  After losing some water type cards, he had 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.  After buying more grass type cards, he had 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.   So in total he has 30 + 34 + 32 = 96 cards. 
2.  
To find the percentage chance that a card will be a water type, divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards.  
The total number of cards is 96.  
The number of water type cards is 32.  So the chance is 32 ÷ 96 = 0. 33.  Rounded to the nearest integer, the answer is 33%.

Kalinda can complete 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can complete half that, which is 2 pieces per minute.  Together they complete 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.  To find the number of minutes it will take to complete, we divide the total number of pieces by the number of pieces they complete per minute: 360 ÷ 6 = 60.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the answer is 1 hour. 
[EXP] 230: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]: 120 baby watermelons were produced originally.  30% of them were ready for harvest, so 30% * 120 = 36 were taken home. 120 - 36 = 84 are left after the first harvest.  3/4 of the remaining were ready to be harvested 2 weeks later, which is 3/4 * 84 = 63. 84 - 63 = 21 melons were not ready after 2 weeks.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 231: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 276,000, [output]: 12 * 20,000 = 240,000.  Then, he will pay a 10% tax, which is 10/100 * 240,000 = 24,000.  So, he pays 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000.  After paying the registration fee for each of the 12 cars, he will pay 12 * 1,000 = 12,000.  So, the total he pays is 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000.  The answer is 276,000. 
[EXP] 232: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 1.  Kylie collects 5 more than Robert.  So Kylie has 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday. 2.  On tuesday, Kylie collects twice as many shells as she did on Monday.  So Kylie has 2 * 25 = 50 shells on tuesday.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 233: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 75, [output]: 50 ants are found. 50 ants is half as many as bugs.  To find the number of bugs, we do 50 * 2 = 100.  There are 100 bugs and 50 ants in the garden. 100 + 50 = 150.  The answer is 150. 
[EXP] 234: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 1/3 of the penguins jump in the ocean, so that's 1/3 of 36, which is 12 penguins. 1/3 of the penguins go inside the cave to eat, so that's 1/3 of 36, which is 12 penguins again. 12 out of the sunbathing penguins go into the ocean and 12 go into the cave. 12 + 12 = 24. 36 - 24 = 12.  There are 12 penguins still left sunbathing.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 235: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]:  First, let's find out how many tomatoes Steve and his girlfriend eat per day.  Steve eats 6 tomatoes.   His girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats because Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.   Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes, his girlfriend eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes.   In total, they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes.  Next, we need to find out how many tomatoes they need for a week.    They eat 9 tomatoes per day and they need to know how they will last for a week.    9 tomatoes * 7 days = 63 tomatoes.   Next, we need to know how many tomatoes 1 vine can produce in a week.   It can produce 3 tomatoes per week.   So, we need to know how many 3's it would take to equal 63.  63 / 3 = 21.  Steve would need 21 vines.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 236: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total number of slices needed by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices per friend: 20 friends * 4 slices per friend = 80 slices.  Then, divide this number by the number of slices per pizza: 80 / 8 = 10 pizzas.  John needs to order 10 pizzas.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 237: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Ram buys 25 pens and each one becomes 1/5 of a new pen. 25 pens become 25/5 = 5 new pens.  He still has the 25 pens he bought.  So in total, he has 25 + 5 = 30 pens.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 238: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Johnny started with an allowance of 20 dollars and added an extra 10 dollars, so he had a total of 20 + 10 = 30 dollars.  Then, this sum tripled, so it became 30 * 3 = 90 dollars.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 239: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  We are given that Jessa is 20 years old.  We can find Joan's age by adding 5 years to Jessa's age, since Joan is 5 years older than Jessa.  So, Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25.  Then we can find Mary's age by subtracting 2 years from Joan's age, since Mary is 2 years younger than Joan.   So, Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23.  Now we can add up their ages.  Jessa's age is 20, Joan's age is 25, and Mary's age is 23.  20 + 25 + 23 = 68.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 240: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 280, [output]: 30% of the 1000 students went out of the hall through exit A, so 30% of 1000 is 0. 30 * 1000 / 100 = 300 students.  There are 1000 - 300 = 700 students remaining. 

Of the remaining 700 students, 3/5 went out of the hall through exit B.  700 * 3/5 = 420 students. 700 - 420 = 280 students remaining.  These 280 students went out through exit C.  The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 241: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  John has 54 candies.  This is 2 times what Robert has, so Robert has 54 / 2 = 27 candies.   James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has 27 + 6 = 33.  John has 54, but James has 33.  To find out how many more John has, we subtract 33 from 54.  54 - 33 = 21.   The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 242: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Dolly has 2 books.  Pandora has 1 book.  They read each other's books as well.   Dolly will read Pandora's book, so Dolly reads 2 + 1 = 3 books.  Pandora will read Dolly's 2 books, so Pandora reads 1 + 2 = 3 books.  In total, they will read 3 + 3 = 6 books.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 243: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Mike was a pen pal with 5 people initially. 5 - 2 = 3, so after stopping being penpals with 2 of them, he has 3 penpals left.  He gets 2 letters from each of them, which is 2 * 3 = 6 letters in total.  He also writes 2 letters to each of his 3 penpals, which is 2 * 3 = 6 letters as well.  So he writes 6 + 6 = 12 letters.   Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes a total of 5 * 12 = 60 pages a week.  He can write a page every 6 minutes, so it takes him 6 minutes to write a page.  60 pages multiplied by 6 minutes per page is 360 minutes.  To convert this to hours, divide by 60: 360 / 60 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 244: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. 15 minutes per day for 30 days is 15 * 30 = 450 minutes. 450 minutes were used by the daily calls with his boss. 450 minutes were used from the allowed minutes. 300 extra minutes were used. 450 + 300 = 750 minutes were used. 1000 - 750 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 245: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Griffin started with 24 fries.  Only after a series of events will we know how many fries he had at the end.  

Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin.  24 - 5 = 19 fries left. 

Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle.  Kyle took 5 fries, so Billy took 5 x 2 = 10 fries.  19 - 10 = 9 fries left.  

Ginger gave Griffin some fries, but we don't know how many until the end, so we don't know how many Griffin had left after that.  

Colby took 3 less than the number of fries Kyle took.  Kyle took 5 fries, so Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries.  9 - 2 = 7 fries left.   

Ginger must have given Griffin enough fries so that 7 fries plus the fries she gave would be 27.  So Ginger must have given 27 - 7 = 20 fries.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 246: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  We are told that the difference in the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  So let's say the number of fish in both aquariums is x.  Then, the number of snails in the first aquarium is 4, and the number of snails in the second aquarium is 32.   We can write an equation: 32 - 4 = 2x.  This simplifies to 28 = 2x.   Solving for x, we have x = 14.  This means there are 14 fish in each aquarium.  So the answer is 14. 
[EXP] 247: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 27000, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1. 6 hours per day and she needs it done 4 times a week, so that's a total of:
    6 hours/day × 4 days/week = 24 hours/week

She needs it done for 5 weeks, so that's a total of:
    24 hours/week × 5 weeks = 120 hours

2.  At $250 per hour, the total cost would be:
    120 hours × $250/hour = $30,000

3.   However, she gives Jean a 10% discount, so we'll calculate the discount first:
    10% of $30,000 = $3,000

4.  To find the new price, subtract the discount from the original cost:
    $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Therefore, Jean paid $27,000.  The answer is $27,000. 
[EXP] 248: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96. 96 dollars were spent in total.  To split the cost evenly with her two parents, each person will have to pay 1/3 of the total cost. 96 / 3 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 249: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]: 1st, we need to find out how many pounds of onions the chef bought. 1 bag has 50 pounds, and the chef bought 4 bags. 50 x 4 = 200 pounds of onions. 1 pound of onions costs 1. 5 dollars, so the total cost is 200 x 1. 5 = 300.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 250: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 5,600, [output]:  First, let's find out how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday.  Since she ate 4 times as many cookies on Monday as her sister, she must have eaten 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.  On Tuesday, she must have eaten twice as many as her sister, so 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.  So Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.  Her sister ate 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.   To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we multiply her number of cookies by 200 calories per cookie.  Sue's total calories is 200 * 46 = 9200.  Her sister's total calories is 200 * 18 = 3600.   To find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we subtract sister's calorie count from Sue's calorie count.  9200 - 3600 = 5600.   The answer is 5600. 
[EXP] 251: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

We have 3 classes, and each has 20 students.  The total number of students in the school is 3 x 20 = 60 students. 

The school is 50% boys and 50% girls. 50% of 60 students is 30 students. 30 students are boys. 

Let's calculate the number of boys in the first and second classes.  There are 20 students in each class, and we know the number of girls in each class: the first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls.  So, the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5, and the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8.  

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13.  We know that the school has 30 boys, so the number of boys in the third class is 30 - 13 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 252: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  Travis had 61 apps originally.  He deleted 9 apps, so he had 61 - 9 = 52 apps.  He then downloaded 18 more, so he had 52 + 18 = 70 apps.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 253: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 73, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Rick killed 10 wolves and 15 cougars the previous night, for a total of 10 + 15 = 25 animals.  Today, he killed three times as many wolves as cougars, so if the number of cougars is x, then the number of wolves is 3x.  He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night, so x = 15 - 3 = 12.  The number of wolves is then 3x = 3 * 12 = 36.   The total number of animals killed today is the number of wolves plus the number of cougars, so 36 + 12 = 48.  The total number of animals killed is then the number of animals killed the previous night plus the number of animals killed today, so 25 + 48 = 73.  The answer is 73. 
[EXP] 254: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]: 3 * 4 = 12.  12 + 6 = 18.  Bill started on the 3rd floor and went to the 18th floor.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 255: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 84, [output]: 1.  Start with Mitchel, who went 30 times.  Anne went 30% less, which is 30 - 30% * 30 = 30 - 9 = 21.  Robert went 4 times as much as Anne, which is 4 * 21 = 84.  The answer is 84. 
[EXP] 256: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 192, [output]: 10 stalls initially have 20 cows each.  So there are a total of 10 x 20 = 200 cows.  Mr.  Sylas buys 40 cows making the total 200 + 40 = 240 cows.   240 cows are distributed equally among 20 stalls.  So each stall will have 240 / 20 = 12 cows.  Since we are asked to find the number of cows in 8 stalls, the answer will be 8 x 12 = 96. 
[EXP] 257: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 100 pennies have 100 cents = 1 dollar. 40 nickels have 40 * 5 = 200 cents = 2 dollars.  20 dimes have 20 * 10 = 200 cents = 2 dollars.  40 dollar bills have 40 * 1 = 40 dollars. 

So in total, Brady has 1 + 2 + 2 + 40 = 45 dollars in his piggy bank.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 258: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5600, [output]: 10-foot sections are each 400 pounds. 1 section is 400 pounds, and since the redwood is 200 feet tall, there are 200 / 10 = 20 sections.  So the weight of the entire tree without termite damage would be 400 * 20 = 8000 pounds.  Since 30% of the wood was eaten by termites, 100 - 30 = 70% of the wood remains.   To find out how much the tree weighs now, we multiply 8000 by the fraction 70/100.  That is (8000 * 70) / 100 = 5600 pounds.  The answer is 5600. 
[EXP] 259: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 8 books at 50 cents each is 8 x 0. 5 = 4 dollars. 4 + 2 is 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 260: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168, [output]:  Let's start with the information that Andrea has 52 apples.  Since she has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.   Since Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.  In total, Andrea has 52 apples and 24 bananas, which is 52 + 24 = 76 fruits.  The answer is 76. 
[EXP] 261: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]: 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen cookies.  Since cookies are always sold in dozens, that means Carla needs 2 cups of flour for every 12 cookies.  

Today, Carla is making 36 cookies.  This is 36 / 12 = 3 dozens.  So she will need 3 times the flour.  3 x 2 = 6 cups of flour for today's cookies.  Tomorrow, she will need 2 dozen cookies.  So she will need 2 times the flour.   2 x 2 = 4 cups of flour for tomorrow's cookies. 

In total, Carla needs 6 cups of flour for today's cookies and 4 cups of flour for tomorrow's cookies.   6 + 4 = 10 cups of flour.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 262: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 62, [output]: 9,300 pennies is the total amount.  We need to find two thirds of this amount.  To find two thirds, we can multiply 9,300 by 2/3.  2/3 * 9,300 = 6,200.  This is the amount of pennies we are looking for.   Since each penny is worth 1 cent, this amount is worth 6,200 cents.  To find the dollar amount, we can divide 6,200 cents by 100.   6,200 / 100 = 62.  The answer is 62. 
[EXP] 263: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 270, [output]:  Maddison started with 5 boxes, each having 50 marbles. 5 x 50 = 250.  After getting 20 marbles from her friend, she had 250 + 20 = 270 marbles.  The answer is 270. 
[EXP] 264: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Since Ferdinand has half the number of trees as Chris, Ferdinand has 6 / 2 = 3 trees.  Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees as Ferdinand.   Since Ferdinand has 3 trees, twice that is 3 * 2 = 6.  5 more than that is 6 + 5 = 11.  So Harry has 11 trees.  There is a difference of 11 - 3 = 8 trees between Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 265: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 400, [output]:  Carmen has 100 dollars.  Samantha has 25 more than Carmen, so Samantha has 100 + 25 = 125 dollars.   Daisy has 50 more than Samantha, so Daisy has 125 + 50 = 175 dollars.  To find out how much all three girls have combined, we need to add up their totals.  That is, 100 + 125 + 175 = 400.  The answer is 400. 
[EXP] 266: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 9500, [output]:  Mrs.  Cruz wants to spend 400,000 dollars.  The selling price of the house is 350,000.  The brokerage fee is 5% of 350,000, so that is 5/100 x 350,000 = 17,500.  The transfer fee is 12% of 350,000, so that is 12/100 x 350,000 = 42,000.  The total fee is 17,500 + 42,000 = 59,500.  The total price of the house is 350,000 + 59,500 = 409,500.  Mrs.  Cruz went 409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500 dollars beyond her budget.   The answer is 9,500. 
[EXP] 267: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 118000, [output]:  Mr.  Tan's house was sold for 400 000.  He paid transfer fees that amount to 3% of the selling price.  To calculate 3% of 400 000, first convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.   3/100 = 0. 03.   Multiply 0. 03 * 400 000 = 12 000.  He also paid a brokerage fee of 5% of the selling price.   Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100.    5/100 = 0.  05.    Multiply 0.  05 * 400 000 = 20 000.  So in total, the fees he paid are 12 000 + 20 000 = 32 000.  He also paid 250 000 for the remaining loan amount of the house.  To find his net proceeds, subtract the total fees and loan from the selling price.    400 000 - (32 000 + 250 000) = 400 000 - 282 000 = 118 000.   The answer is 118 000. 
[EXP] 268: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 91, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  

First, the oil takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees.  Then it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees.  To find 40% of 20 minutes, multiply 20 by 0. 4, which is 8.  So it takes 20 + 8 = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.  After heating the oil, it takes 5 minutes less than 28 minutes to cook the chicken.  So it takes 28 - 5 = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.   In total, it takes 20 minutes to heat up the oil plus 23 minutes to cook the chicken, which is 20 + 23 = 43 minutes.  The answer is 43. 
[EXP] 269: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1375, [output]: 50 newspaper ads for 5 dollars each will be 50 * 5 = 250 dollars. 15 television ads for 75 dollars each will be 15 * 75 = 1125 dollars. 250 + 1125 = 1375. 1375 dollars were spent on all the ads.  The answer is 1375. 
[EXP] 270: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 16 balls are originally.  Half of the balls are golf balls. 16 / 2 = 8.  There are 8 golf balls.  Half of the golf balls are blue.  8 / 2 = 4.   There are 4 blue golf balls.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 271: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 762, [output]:  Mary has 3 bags of M&Ms.  The first bag had 300 M&Ms.  The second bag had 12 more than the first, so it had 300 + 12 = 312 M&Ms.  The third bag had half the number of M&Ms as the first, so it had 300 / 2 = 150 M&Ms.   To get the total number of M&Ms, add up all the number of M&Ms in each bag: 300 + 312 + 150 = 762 M&Ms.  The answer is 762. 
[EXP] 272: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each.  So in total he has 2 * 3 = 6 bedrooms.  Each bedroom has 2 windows, so in total there are 6 * 2 = 12 windows in bedrooms.  There are also 4 windows in each house not connected to bedrooms.  So that is 2 * 4 = 8 more windows.  Now we have to add the 12 windows in bedrooms and the 8 windows not connected to bedrooms.   So there are 12 + 8 = 20 windows.  Finally, there are 2 houses.  That means 2 * 20 = 40.  So, there are 40 total windows between both the houses.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 273: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  First, calculate the total cost of the items:
$4. 20 (cocoa) + $9. 45 (laundry) + $1. 35 (pasta) = $15.  00 (total cost)

Mother paid $20, so she has $20 minus the cost of the items:
$20 - $15.  00 = $5.  00 (change)

The cashier will give the mother $5 in change.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 274: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]: 1800 is the total number of stitches in the sweater. 900 is used for the body. 1/10 of 900 is 90, which is used for the collar. 2 times the stitches for the collar is 180, which is used for the rosette.  900 + 90 + 180 = 1170. 1800 - 1170 is 630, which is left for the two sleeves. 630 / 2 = 315.  The answer is 315. 
[EXP] 275: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3200, [output]: 20 packets of tomato seeds cost 20 x 40 = 800 dollars. 80 packets of celery seeds cost 80 x 30 = 2400 dollars. 800 + 2400 is 3200. 3200 dollars were used to buy the seeds.  The answer is 3200. 
[EXP] 276: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 138, [output]: 54 lines are in his solo song.  The first scene has twice the number of lines as the solo song, so that is 2 * 54 = 108.  Only a third of those lines are his, so 108 / 3 = 36 lines are his.  The second scene has six more lines than the solo song.  So it has 54 + 6 = 60 lines.  Four-fifths of those lines are his, so 4/5 * 60 = 48 lines are his.  Adding them all together, 54 (solo) + 36 (first scene) + 48 (second scene) = 138 lines are his lines.  The answer is 138. 
[EXP] 277: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 80 cards in total. 2/5 of them had the letter A, which is 80 * 2/5 = 32 cards. 32 cards already accounted for, so there are 80 - 32 = 48 cards remaining. 1/2 of the remaining had the letter B, which is 48 * 1/2 = 24 cards. 24 cards already accounted for, so there are 48 - 24 = 24 cards remaining. 5/8 of the rest had the letter C, which is 24 * 5/8 = 15 cards. 15 cards already accounted for, so there are 24 - 15 = 9 cards remaining.  These 9 cards have the letter D.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 278: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 30 small holes require 30 x 3 = 90 minutes, and 15 large holes require 15 x 10 = 150 minutes. 90 + 150 is 240. 240 minutes is equal to 240 / 60 = 4 hours.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 279: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  We don't know the current ages of Mico and Marco, but we know their total is 20.  Let's call their current ages m and n.  Then m + n = 20. 

In 10 years, their ages will be m + 10 and n + 10.  The sum of their ages will be:
(m + 10) + (n + 10) = m + n + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40

They started with a sum of 20, so the sum of their ages will still be:
20 + 20 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 280: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let’s start by saying that Ruby’s current age is R and Sam’s current age is S.  Since Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, we can write an equation: 

R = 6*S.  Now, after 9 years, Ruby will be R+9 years old, and Sam will be S+9 years old.   According to the problem, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam at that time.  

So, we can set up an equation based on this information: 

R+9 = 3*(S+9).  

Now we can substitute R = 6*S into the equation: 

6*S+9 = 3*(S+9) 

First, distribute the 3 to the terms inside the parentheses: 

6*S+9 = 3S+27 

Now move all the terms to one side of the equation: 

6*S - 3S = 27 - 9 

Combine like terms: 

3*S = 18 

Divide by 3 to solve for S: 

S = 6 

So Sam is currently 6 years old.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 281: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 20 popsicles at 25 cents each will be 20 x 0. 25 = 5 dollars.  4 ice cream bars at 50 cents each will be 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars.  In total, Peter paid 5 + 2 = 7 dollars.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 282: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2450, [output]: 70 spots for 1 cobra is twice as many as a mamba, so 70 / 2 = 35 spots for a mamba. 40 cobras will have 40 * 70 = 2800 spots and 60 mambas will have 60 * 35 = 2100 spots. 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots in total.  Half of that is 4900 / 2 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
[EXP] 283: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 195, [output]: 12 team members + 3 coaches = 15 people. 2 guests for each team member will be 2 x 12 = 24 guests. 15 people + 24 guests = 39 people.  For each pizza, 3 people are served. 39 people will need 39/3 = 13 pizzas. 13 pizzas will cost 13 x 15 = 195 dollars.  The answer is 195. 
[EXP] 284: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]: 25 inches is the total length of the necklace. 8 topaz gemstones are 8 inches long. 25 - 8 = 17. 17 inches are left to be filled with sterling silver beads. 17 inches is equal to 17 * 4 = 68 quarter inches, or 68 beads.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 285: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]:  Alani wrote 20 stories in the first week.  Then she wrote 2 times as many in the second week, which is 2 x 20 = 40.  Altogether, she wrote 20 + 40 = 60 stories.  Braylen wrote 40 stories in the first week.   Then he wrote 2 times as many in the second week, which is 2 x 40 = 80.   Altogether, he wrote 40 + 80 = 120 stories.   Margot wrote 60 stories in the first week.   Then she wrote 2 times as many in the second week, which is 2 x 60 = 120.   Altogether, she wrote 60 + 120 = 180 stories.  So in total, they wrote 60 + 120 + 180 = 360 stories.   The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 286: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Ann's brother is twice her age, which is 2 x 9 = 18.  So her brother is 18 years old.  3 years later, he will be 18 + 3 = 21.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 287: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Kelly has 5 quarters, which is 5 x 25 cents = 125 cents. 2 dimes is 2 x 10 cents = 20 cents. 125 cents + 20 cents = 145 cents. 145 cents minus 55 cents (for the pop) is 145 - 55 = 90 cents.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 288: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  A 76-star flag has three rows of 8 stars, which is 8 * 3 = 24.  It has 2 rows of 6 stars, which is 6 * 2 = 12.  So far, there are 24 + 12 = 36 stars.  To find the number of 5-star rows, subtract the number of stars accounted for by the 8 and 6-star rows from 76.   76 - 36 = 40.  Then, divide the remaining stars by 5.  40 / 5 = 8.   The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 289: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 2000 is the maximum weight the trucks can carry.  Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.  We need to know how many trucks are needed to carry 80 flagstones.  First, we need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.  That would be 80 x 75 = 6000.  Then we divide 6000 by 2000 to find out how many trucks we need.   6000 / 2000 = 3.   So we need 3 trucks.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 290: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour. 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours.  The slow lane car is traveling at half the speed, so it is traveling at 30 miles/hour.  480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.   The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 291: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 390, [output]:  Ali has 22 medals.  Izzy has 5 less, so Izzy has 22 - 5 = 17 medals.  Together, they have 22 + 17 = 39 medals.  The problem states that they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting, so the number of medals given out is 10 times larger than 39.  39 * 10 = 390.  The answer is 390. 
[EXP] 292: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 4 adults will get 4 * 6 = 24 chocolate bars. 8 packets of 5 chocolate bars will have 8 * 5 = 40 chocolate bars.  After giving 24 to the adults, 40 - 24 = 16 chocolate bars will be left for the children.  Since the children will get the rest, there are 8 children, and 16 chocolate bars are to be shared equally, each child will get 16 / 8 = 2 chocolate bars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 293: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Susan earns 5 dollars for every 10 minutes.  From 8 a. m.  to 11 a.   m.   is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.  She pauses for 30 minutes.  So, she works 180 - 30 = 150 minutes.  Susan earns 5 dollars for every 10 minutes, so she earns 5 * (150 / 10) = 5 * 15 = 75 dollars.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 294: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 83, [output]:  Mike has 21 points.  Jim has 3 less points than Mike, so Jim has 21 - 3 = 18 points.   Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so Tony has 2 x 21 = 42 points.   Their total before the extra points were distributed is 21 + 18 + 42 = 81 points.   

In the 4th round, anyone with over 20 points gets an extra point.  Mike and Tony both have over 20 points, so they each get an extra point.  So Mike now has 21 + 1 = 22 points and Tony has 42 + 1 = 43 points.  Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point.  Their new points are 22, 18, and 43.  The total points after the extra points have been distributed is 22 + 18 + 43 = 83.  The answer is 83. 
[EXP] 295: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 15 oranges are initially bought.  The oldest son is 8 and the youngest is half of that, so the youngest is 8 / 2 = 4. 8 and 4 are the ages of the sons.  The oldest son will wash 8 oranges, and the youngest will wash 4 oranges.  They will wash a total of 8 + 4 = 12 oranges. 15 - 12 = 3 oranges are left unwashed.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 296: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 370, [output]:  Darren started with 100 pushups, 50 squats, and 20 dumbbell presses on the first day.  On the second day, he did:
* 20 more pushups than on the first day, which is 100 + 20 = 120 pushups
* 10 fewer squats than on the first day, which is 50 - 10 = 40 squats
* Doubled the number of dumbbell presses, which is 20 x 2 = 40 dumbbell presses

The total number of activities for the first day is 100 + 50 + 20 = 170.  The total number of activities for the second day is 120 + 40 + 40 = 200.  The total number of activities for both days is 170 + 200 = 370.  Therefore, Darren did a total of 370 activities in the two days.  The answer is 370. 
[EXP] 297: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 5 members of the household eat rice every meal, which means they eat it twice a day. 5 members x 2 meals = 10 people eat rice every day.  They each eat 0. 2 kg of rice, so they eat a total of 10 x 0. 2 = 2 kg of rice per day.  Since there are 7 days in a week, the total rice consumption per week is 7 x 2 = 14 kg.  We want to know how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last.  Divide the number of kg in the bag by the weekly consumption to get the number of weeks it will last.  42 / 14 is 3.  The answer is 3 weeks. 
[EXP] 298: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 55, [output]:  Sam had to sell 120 crates in a week.  Two days, Monday and Friday, he was closed.  So he had to sell for 5 days instead of 7. 20 crates were sold on the weekend.  For the 5 working days, he sold 15 + 12 + 18 = 45 crates.  In total, for the whole week, he sold 20 + 45 = 65 crates.  He was off his target by 120 - 65 = 55 crates.  The answer is 55. 
[EXP] 299: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 500, [output]:  Carmen initially bid $200.  After the first other bidder, the price rose to 200 + 50 = 250.  Then Carmen bid.  The next person bid, the price rose to 250 + 50 = 300.  Then Carmen bid again.  The next person bid, the price rose to 300 + 50 = 350.  Then Carmen bid one more time.   The desk cost $350 after the last bidder, so that is what Carmen paid.  The answer is 350. 
[EXP] 300: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31800, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  We need to find the total distance John travels in a day. 30 miles to work and back is 60 miles.  He does this 5 days a week. 5 x 60 is 300 miles.  

2.   So, the total distance per week is 300 miles and John goes 50 weeks a year.   So, the total distance per year is 50 x 300 = 15000 miles. 

3.   John gets charged $2 per mile. 15000 miles at $2 per mile is 15000 x $2 = $30000.  That would be the total cost if there were no bonus.  

4.     There is also an additional $150 bonus per month.   Since there are 12 months in a year, the total bonus per year is 12 x 150 = $1800.  

5.    Finally, the total cost per year is the total cost without bonus plus the bonus: 30000 + 1800 = $31800.  The answer is $31800. 
[EXP] 301: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]:  On Sunday, Peter exercised for 23 minutes.  On Monday, Peter exercised for 16 minutes.  So he exercised for 23 + 16 minutes on Sunday and Monday combined.   That is 23 + 16 = 39 minutes.  He wants to exercise for twice this amount of time, so he will need to exercise for 2 * 39 = 78 minutes on Tuesday.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 302: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 8, [output]: 1 piece of paper.  The reason is that a single piece of paper can be folded to have both sides used, like in the example you gave.  page 1 is printed on the left back, page 2 is printed on the left front, and then, perhaps page 32 is printed on the right back, and page 31 is printed on the right front.  This use of both sides of the paper is an example of a fold.  Hence, only 1 piece of paper is required.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 303: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Annika started with 50 dollars.  She spent half of it on food and snacks.  Half of 50 is 50 / 2 = 25.   So she spent 25 dollars on food and snacks.  Then, she spent an additional 10 dollars on rides, for a total of 25 + 10 = 35.  So she has 50 - 35 dollars left.  50 - 35 is 15.   The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 304: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1300, [output]:  Let's first find out how many books she sold in the first year.  Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she did in the current year, and this year she sold 45 books, then she sold 45 x 2 = 90 books in the first year.  In total she sold 45 + 90 = 135 books in the first year and the current year.   She had 250 books originally and there are 50 unsold, so she sold 250 - 50 = 200 books.   That means the remaining books were sold in the second year: 200 - 135 = 65. 65 books were sold in the second year at 20 dollars each, so she earned 65 x 20 = 1300 dollars in the second year.  The answer is 1300. 
[EXP] 305: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3200, [output]:  Watson works a 10-hour shift each day, for 5 days a week.  That is 10 x 5 = 50 hours in a week. 

He earns $10 per hour, so in one week he earns 50 x 10 = 500 dollars. 

Additionally, he got a $300 bonus each week.  So his total earnings per week is 500 + 300 = 800 dollars. 

In April, there are 4 weeks.  So Watson earned 4 x 800 = 3200 dollars.  The answer is 3200. 
[EXP] 306: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 20 people arm wrestled. 80% of 20 is (20 * 80) / 100 = 16. 16 people he beats. 20 - 16 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 307: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  A bakery produces 60 loaves of bread.  Two-thirds of the loaves, or (2/3) * 60 = 40, are sold in the morning.  That leaves 60 - 40 = 20 loaves.  Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening.  So half of 20 is 10.  That means the afternoon sold 10 loaves.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 308: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.  Sandy loses as much weight in a week as Joey does in 4 weeks, so Sandy loses 8/4 = 2 pounds per week.  To lose the same amount of weight (8 pounds), Sandy will need 8 / 2 = 4 weeks.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 309: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's start by finding the discount for the ice cream.  The original price is $13 and the sold price is $11.  The discount is $13 - $11 = $2 for one tub of ice cream. 

For 2 tubs of ice cream, the discount will be $2 * 2 = $4. 

For the packet of milk, the original price is unknown, but since it's discounted by $0. 5, the sold price must be the original price minus the discount.  The discount for one packet of milk is $0. 5.  

Since you are buying 4 packets, the total discount for the packet of milk will be $0.  5 * 4 = $2.  

To find the total discount, add the discounts for ice cream and milk: $4 + $2 = $6.  So, you will save $6 by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 310: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break it down:

* An extra arm every 3 days, means that in 15 days, Helena will grow:
15 / 3 = 5 extra arms

* An extra leg every 5 days, means that in 15 days, Helena will grow:
15 / 5 = 3 extra legs

Adding them up, Helena will grow 5 extra arms and 3 extra legs, for a total of 8 new limbs.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 311: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2050, [output]:  First, we find out the cost of the flight ticket:

The cost of a business suit is $100. 5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 x 100 = 500.  The flight ticket is 700 more than this, so it is 700 + 500 = 1200. 

Then, we find the total cost of the things Theo bought:

6 business suits for 100 each is 6 x 100 = 600. 3 suitcases for 50 each is 3 x 50 = 150.   The cost of the flight ticket is 1200.   So the total cost is 600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950. 

Theo has $6000 to spend on this trip.  He wants to save $2000 for the trip, so he can use $6000 - 2000 = 4000.  Subtract the cost of the things he bought from this, and he has $4000 - 1950 = 2050 dollars left for gifts.  The answer is 2050. 
[EXP] 312: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 91, [output]: 5 people in the family, 3 people eat 3 eggs each day.  So the 3 people eat 3 * 3 = 9 eggs in a day.  The rest of the family eats 5 - 3 = 2 people, and each eats 2 eggs.  So the rest of the family eats 2 * 2 = 4 eggs.  Total eggs consumed per day is 9 + 4 = 13.  In a week, the family will eat 7 * 13 = 91 eggs.  The answer is 91. 
[EXP] 313: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Let's work backwards.  Quinn is 30, so Jane is 30 - 3 = 27 years old since she's 3 years younger.  Trent is 27 + 5 = 32 years old since he's 5 years older than Jane.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 314: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120000, [output]:  First, find out how old Noah is currently.  Cera is 46, and Noah is half the age Cera is six years ago.  Therefore, six years ago, Cera was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.  Since Noah is half the age Cera was six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.  Now, Noah is 20 + 6 = 26 years old. 

Second, calculate the population of Chile six years ago.  The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah six years ago.  So, population = 3000 * 20.  Population = 60000.  This is half the population of Chile now. 
 
Third, find out the population of Chile now.   The population of Chile six years ago was half the population of Chile now.  So, the population now is double the population six years ago.   Therefore, population now = 2 * 60000 = 120000.  The answer is 120000. 
[EXP] 315: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 30, [output]: 105 is the total number of players.  Let's start by identifying the number of players on the defense.  Let's call this number "d". 

The number of players on the offense is twice as many as the number of players on the defense, so it is 2d. 

The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it is d/2. 

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the number of players on the offense, defense, and special teams:

105 = 2d + d + (d/2)

Combine like terms and solve for d:

105 = 5d/2

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

210 = 5d

Divide both sides by 5:

42 = d

So, the number of players on the defense is 42.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 316: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 2 families with 6 people is 2 * 6 = 12 people. 3 families with 4 people is 3 * 4 = 12 people.  So in total there are 12 + 12 = 24 people.  8 people can't come due to illness, so we need to subtract that.  24 - 8 = 16.  Then 1/4 of 8 (which is 2) have previous commitments, so we need to subtract those too.  16 - 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 317: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 156, [output]:  Solomon started with a store of 50 marbles. 20 more marbles were added, so now there are 50 + 20 = 70 marbles.  Then his father gave him more marbles.  His father gave him (2/5) * 20 = 8 marbles.  So now there are 70 + 8 = 78 marbles.  Each marble weighs 2kg.  So the total weight is 78 * 2 = 156 kg.  The answer is 156 kg. 
[EXP] 318: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many cubic feet of water the pool holds.  To do this, we need to multiply the length, width, and depth.  

Length = 6 feet
Width = 4 feet
Depth = 5 feet

The formula for volume of a rectangular prism is: Length x Width x Depth.  So the pool holds:
6 x 4 x 5 = 120 cubic feet

The pool holds 120 cubic feet.   It cost 10 cents per cubic foot to fill.  So the cost will be:
120 cubic feet x 10 cents/cubic foot = 1200 cents

To convert cents to dollars, we can divide by 100:
1200 / 100 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 319: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 123, [output]: 30 boys are in the classroom.  There are 3 times as many girls as boys.  So the number of girls is 30 * 3 = 90.  The number of nongendered children is 1/10 the number of boys, so it is 30 / 10 = 3.  The total number of children is 30 + 90 + 3 = 123.  The answer is 123. 
[EXP] 320: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  From the problem, the ratio of the electric poles to the electric wires is 1:3, so for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.  If there are 45 electric wires, and we divide 45 by 3, we get 15.  Therefore, there would be 15 * 1 = 15 electric poles required.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 321: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  At the beginning of the party, there are 25 + 15 = 40 people.  After some people left, 1/4 of 40 people left.  1/4 of 40 is 10 people who left.  So there are 40 - 10 = 30 people left. 22 of these 30 people are men, so that means the number of women left is 30 - 22 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 322: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Since the book costs $4, the magazine costs half as much, which is $4/2 = $2.  The pen costs $1 less than the magazine, so it costs $2 - $1 = $1.  The answer is $1. 
[EXP] 323: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many pencils Jam has. 2 loose pencils plus 3 boxes full of pencils makes a total of 26 pencils.  Since a box of pencils is not specified, let's represent the number of pencils in each box by a variable, say x.  Then, Jam has 3x + 2 pencils.  Since this is equal to 26, we can set up the equation:

3x + 2 = 26

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives us:

3x = 24

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 8

So Jam has 8 pencils per box.   She has 3 boxes full of pencils, so she has 3x = 24 pencils.  Adding the 2 loose pencils, Jam has 26 pencils in total. 

Now, we want to find the total number of pencils Jam and Meg have in total.  Jam has 26 pencils.  Meg has 46 pencils.  Together, they have 26 + 46 = 72 pencils.  To find how many boxes are needed, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in a box.   Jam and Meg have 72 pencils in total, and 8 pencils per box.  So, the total number of boxes needed is:

72 ÷ 8 = 9

So, Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 324: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  Shannon needs to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.  For every 13 degrees, she adds an ice cube.  So, to lower the temperature by 65 degrees, she needs 65 / 13 = 5 ice cubes. 
2.   Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker.   So, 5 ice cubes will make the coffee 5 * 12 = 60 milliliters weaker. 
3.   Then, she adds 15 milliliters of cream.  This will also make the coffee weaker. 

To find the total weakening of the coffee, she should add 60 milliliters of weakening from the ice cubes and 15 milliliters from the cream.   So, she will have a total of 60 + 15 = 75 milliliters weaker iced coffee.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 325: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 5 people leave with 7 new records. 2 old records are traded for 1 new record.  So, the 5 people traded 7 * 2 = 14 old records.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 326: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 224000, [output]: 2/5 of the total number of employees is 2/5 of 100 = 40. 40 is the number of junior programmers, so 100 - 40 = 60 is the number of senior programmers.  Junior programmers are paid $2000 per month, so the total paid to junior programmers is 40 x 2000 = 80,000.  Senior programmers are paid $400 more, so they are paid $2400 per month.  The total paid to senior programmers is 60 x 2400 = 144,000.   The total paid to all programmers is the sum of the two: 80,000 + 144,000 = 224,000.  The answer is 224,000. 
[EXP] 327: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Let's break down the problem step by step. 

1.  Some people got on a bus at the terminal.  Let's call the number of people who got on at the terminal x.  The total number of people initially on the bus is x. 

2.   At the first bus stop, 5 more people got in.   So the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is x + 5. 

3.   At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in.  This means the number of people who got down is subtracted from the total, while the number of people who got in is added.   So the total number of people after the second stop is (x + 5) - 7 + 8. 
   (x + 5 - 7) + 8 = x - 2 + 8
   x - 2 + 8
   x + 6
4.  If there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop, then the total number of people after the second bus stop should be 20.   We found in step 3 that x + 6 = 20.     
x + 6 = 20
x = 20 - 6
x = 14

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 328: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Oscar started with 24 lollipops.  He ate 2 on his way to school, so he has 24 - 2 = 22 lollipops left.  Then he gave 14 lollipops to his friends, which leaves him with 22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.  He then bought twice as many lollipops as he gave away, so he bought 2 x 14 = 28 lollipops.  8 + 28 = 36.  Then he ate 3 more that night, leaving him with 36 - 3 = 33.  Finally, he ate 2 more in the morning, leaving him with 33 - 2 = 31.  The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 329: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 60% of the phone is charged already.  To fully charge, it needs to reach 100% charged.  So it needs to gain 100% - 60% = 40% more charge.  Each 3 minutes it gains 1 percentage point, so 40% is 40/1 = 40 times 3 = 120 minutes. 120 minutes = 120 / 60 = 2 hours.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 330: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Erin has 7 lollipops originally.  Her mother gives her 10 more, so Erin now has 7 + 10 = 17 lollipops.  After giving 3 lollipops away to Ella, Erin has 17 - 3 = 14 lollipops left.  The answer is 14.

[EXP] 332: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8400, [output]:  Let's calculate the total earnings for each job. 

Job A:
* Hourly wage: $15
* Hours worked: 2000 hours/year
* Annual salary: 2000 hours x $15/hour = $30,000
* Tax rate: 20%
* Taxes: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
* Take-home pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
* Annual salary: $42,000
* Property tax: $6,000
* Net income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
* Tax rate: 10%
* Taxes: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
* Take-home pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

Now, let's compare the take-home pay for both jobs:

* Job A: $24,000
* Job B: $32,400

To find the difference in take-home pay between the two jobs, subtract the take-home pay of Job A from the take-home pay of Job B:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

So, Nick will make $8,400 more per year at Job B compared to Job A.  The answer is 8400.

[EXP] 337: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Maria started with 8 shares of stock valued at $8 each.  So her initial investment was 8 shares x $8 per share = $64.  The stock price increases by 50% the first year so now each share is worth $8 + ($8 * 0. 5) = $12.  So 8 shares are now worth 8 x $12 = $96.   In the second year, the stock decreases 25% so now each share is worth $12 - ($12 * 0. 25) = $9.  So all 8 shares are now worth 8 x $9 = $72.   The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 338: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Luke ate 2 hot dogs.  Thomas ate 3 times more hot dogs than Luke.  That means Thomas ate 2 x 3 = 6 hot dogs.

[EXP] 339: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 60, [output]: 200 students are divided into 3 groups. 2 of them are equal in number, and the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups.  If we let x be the number of students in one of the middle-sized groups, then the smallest group has x - 10 students.  The other middle-sized group also has x students, since both are equal in number. 

The total number of students is the sum of the students in each group:

200 = x + x + (x - 10)

Combine like terms:

200 = 2x - 10

Add 10 to both sides:

210 = 2x

Divide both sides by 2:

105 = x

So the number of students in one of the middle-sized groups is 105.  The smallest group has 105 - 10 students, or 95.  The answer is 95. 
[EXP] 340: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's break this problem down!

Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, let's say the number of cows is x.  Then the number of chickens is 2x. 

Since there are 60 animals in total, the total number of cows and chickens is 60.   So we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 20

So there are 20 cows and 40 chickens.  A cow has 4 legs and a chicken has 2 legs.  So the total number of legs is:

20 cows x 4 legs/cow = 80 legs
40 chickens x 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

Add the legs together:

80 + 80 = 160 legs

The answer is 160.

[EXP] 342: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 260, [output]:  Let's break down the information we have:

* The pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad. 
* The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. 
* The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird.  If the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the yellow snake will weigh 50 + 10 = 60 pounds, and the red bird will weigh 50 - 20 = 30 pounds. 


So the weights are:

- Blue beetle: 50 pounds
- Green toad: 50 pounds
- Red bird: 30 pounds
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds

The total weight of the animals is 50 + 50 + 30 + 60 = 190 pounds.  Adding the weight of the container (20 pounds), the total weight is 190 + 20 = 210 pounds.  The answer is 210.

[EXP] 349: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 1) Let's find the money they used to make per day:

They sold 10 tractors per day, and each tractor made $100. 10 x 100 = 1000.  So they made $1000 per day selling tractors. 
2) Let's find the money they make now:

They sell 5 silos per day, and each silo makes $220. 5 x 220 = 1100.   So they make $1100 per day selling silos. 
3) To find the percentage difference, first find the difference: 1100 - 1000 = 100.  That's an increase of $100 per day.  Then, find the percentage: (100/1000) x 100 = 10%.  Therefore, they make 10% more per day now.  The answer is 10%. 
[EXP] 350: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2640, [output]:  To solve this problem, let's first find out how much Madeline spends on each item per month.  Food costs $25 per week, so per month it costs 4 * 25 = 100.  Treats cost $20 per month.  Medicine costs $100 per month.  So monthly total amount = 100 + 20 + 100 = 220.  Then we need to multiply this by 12 months per year: 12 * 220 = 2640.  The answer is 2640.

She wants to play 1 round of mini-golf (5 dollars), buy 5 dollars in arcade tokens and ride the go-karts twice (2 x 10 = 20 dollars).  In total, that will cost 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.  So, she has 90 - 30 = 60 dollars left.  She can now invite friends who will share the remaining 60 dollars.  How many friends can she invite?.  One friend will spend 60/1 = 60 dollars.   Each friend will spend 60/ friend's number = x.   We know that x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x + x will be 60.   The sum of x's = 60.   So, 10 x 6 = 60.  Morgan can invite 6 friends.

[EXP] 360: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Billy started with 10 dollars.  He buys candy.  Candy costs $1. 50 per pound.   Let's solve the problem step by step. 

First, we will find out how much Billy spent on candy:
10 - x = y (where x is the amount spent on candy and y is the amount of money left)

Then we find out how much money he has left for gumballs:
y/2 = z (where z is the amount of money he has left for gumballs)

Then we find out how much money he spent on gumballs:
z = q * . 05 (where q is the number of gumballs)

We are given q = 40, so we can find z:
z = 40 * . 05 = 2

Now we can plug this back into our second equation:
y/2 = 2

So y = 4

Now we can use the fact that 10 - x = y:
10 - x = 4
- x = -6
x = 6

So Billy spent 6 dollars on candy, which is equal to 6/1. 50 = 4 pounds.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 361: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Let's start with what we know: Carver is 45 years old.  We know that Carver is 5 years less than twice his son's age, so we can set up an equation:

2x - 5 = 45

where x is the age of his son.  We can solve for x by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50
x = 25

So Carver's son is 25 years old.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 362: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  The train goes from the first city to the second city 75 miles.  From the second to the third city it goes 100 miles.  To go from the third city back to the first city, it goes 75 + 100 - 50 = 125 miles.  So it goes 75 + 100 + 125 = 300 miles each day.  It goes this trip 3 times a day, so in total it goes 3 * 300 = 900 miles each day.   Then, since the train needs service every 18,000 miles, we can divide 18,000 by 900 to find out how many days it takes for the train to go 18,000 miles. 

18,000 / 900 = 20

So the train goes 20 days between services.  The answer is 20.

Four times 3 is 12.  12 - 5 = 7, so 7 were kicked out for shoplifting.  Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale.  3 * 7 = 21.  3 + 7 + 21 = 31 people were kicked out for those reasons.  But 50 people were kicked out in total, so the number of people kicked out for other reasons is 50 - 31 = 19.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 369: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Let's start with what we know: Erin has 14 points after scoring some more, and now she has 3 times more points than Sara, who has 8 points.  Since Sara has 8 points, 3 times 8 is 24.  So Erin has 24 points now.  But we are told that she scored 14 points recently, so before she scored those 14 points, she must have had 24 - 14 = 10 points.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 370: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1198, [output]: 44 seniors need awards.  Each senior will get a picture frame that costs $20.  That is 44 * 20 = 880 dollars for the picture frames.  The logo for each frame will cost an additional 20% of the cost, which is 20% x $20 = $4 per frame.  The total cost of the logos is 44 * 4 = 176 dollars.   So the total cost for the picture frames and logos is 880 + 176 = 1056 dollars.   2 seniors will also get pins that cost $5 each, so that is 2 * 5 = 10 dollars.   1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will receive cords that cost $12 each.   1/4 of 44 is 11.   So 11 officers need cords, which will be 11 * 12 = 132 dollars.  To find the total cost of the senior gifts, we add up all the costs: 1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198.  The answer is 1198.

[EXP] 372: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 1.  The store sold 14 pairs on Friday. 
2.  The next day, they sold double that number of shoes.  Double of 14 is 14 * 2 = 28. 
3.  On the last day, they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before.  The day before, they sold 28 shoes.  So they sold half of 28.  Half of 28 is 28 / 2 = 14.  
4.  In total, they sold 14 on Friday, 28 on Saturday, and 14 on Sunday.  The total number of shoes sold is 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 shoes.  However, 6 shoes were returned.  So the net number of shoes sold is 56 - 6 = 50.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 377: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  There are originally 40 pupils in the class.  Half of the class likes blue, so half of 40 likes blue. 40 / 2 is 20, so 20 pupils like blue.  There are 40 - 20 = 20 pupils remaining.  One-fourth of 20 likes green, so 20 / 4 = 5 pupils like green.  The rest of the pupils like yellow, so 20 - 5 = 15 pupils like yellow.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 378: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 56 dollars is the amount Lucy made from selling apples on monday.  We don't know how many apples she picked that day, but we can find out by dividing 56 dollars by 4 dollars per apple. 56/4 = 14, so Lucy sold 14 apples on monday. 

On tuesday, Lucy picked 12 apples. 

On wednesday, Lucy picked double the number she picked the day before.  The number she picked the day before was 12.  So on wednesday, she picked 12 * 2 = 24 apples. 

The total number of apples she picked is 14 (on monday) + 12 (on tuesday) + 24 (on wednesday). 14 + 12 + 24 is 50.  The answer is 50.

[EXP] 383: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 350, [output]:  Axel has 50 silver pesos and 80 gold pesos.  So he has 50 + 80 = 130 pesos in total.  Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel, which is 2 x 50 = 100.  She also has 40 more gold pesos than Axel, so 80 + 40 = 120 gold pesos.   In total, Anna has 100 + 120 = 220 pesos.  Axel and Anna together have 130 + 220 = 350 pesos.  The answer is 350. 
[EXP] 384: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Millie spends 18 dollars to buy supplies.  Then she sells lemonade.  There are 3 pitchers of lemonade.  Each pitcher holds 12 cups.  So she has 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.   She sells each cup of lemonade for 1 dollar.   So she will make 36 dollars.   To buy the supplies was 18 dollars.   36 - 18 is 18.   She makes 18 dollars.  Then she works for an hour and she makes even more.   She sells 4 cups per hour.  So in one hour, she makes 4 dollars.    She makes 1 dollar profit per cup.   1 dollar per cup * 4 cups per hour = 4 dollars profit per hour.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 385: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 12. 8 hectares is the number of hectares he had left after selling 3/5 of his land.  So, we need to find the total number of hectares he had at first. 

Let's assume the total amount of land Mr.  Ruther had is x hectares. 

Selling 3/5 of the land means he sold 3/5*x hectares of land.  Then, he had 2/5*x hectares of land left.  

Since he had 12. 8 hectares left after selling 3/5 of his land, we can set up the equation:

2/5*x = 12. 8

To solve for x, multiply both sides by 5 and divide by 2:

(x) = (12. 8 * 5)/2

x = 32 

So, Mr.  Ruther had 32 hectares of land initially.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 386: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 52 members are originally in the choir. 50% are boys, so 50 / 100 * 52 = 26 are boys.  The remaining are girls, so 52 - 26 = 26 are girls.  The choir decides to perform with just its female members, so there are 26 girls.  On the day of the performance, half the people can't make it, so 26 / 2 = 13.  26 - 13 = 13 girls performed.   The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them, so 13 + 3 = 16 people sang in the performance.  The answer is 16.

Dasha bought ride tickets to buy 9 rides.  Each ride costs 2 tickets at 2 dollars per ticket.  So Dasha spent 9 * 2 * 2 dollars on tickets, which is 36 dollars.  David spent 30 dollars.   David saved 36 - 30 dollars.   36 - 30 = 6.  David saved 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 391: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  To find out how many inches of ribbon can be used for each gift bow, first we need to find the total number of gift bows that Monica needs to make.  There are 6 gifts to wrap for her family, 4 gifts to wrap for her friends, and 2 gifts to wrap for her teachers.  This makes a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.   Since Monica wants to make a bow for each gift, she needs to make 12 bows.  There are 144 inches of ribbon available.  So how many inches of ribbon can be used for each gift bow?  We can use the division operation to find this out.  144 ÷ 12 is 12.  This means each gift bow can be made with 12 inches of ribbon.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 392: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have.  The ratio is 5:6, which means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6.  We can write the ratio as an equation: B = 5x, S = 6x, where B is the number of popsicles Betty has and S is the number of popsicles Sam has, and x is a constant. 

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, so we can set up the equation:

B + S = 165

Substituting the expressions for B and S from the ratio, we get:

5x + 6x = 165

Combine like terms:

11x = 165

Divide both sides by 11:

x = 15

Now that we have found x, we can find the number of popsicles that Betty and Sam have:

B = 5x = 5(15) = 75

S = 6x = 6(15) = 90

To find the number of popsicles that Sam has more than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles they have:

S - B = 90 - 75 = 15

So, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 393: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 60 dollars a month for cable.  He gets Netflix for 10 dollars.  For Hulu and Disney Plus, he pays 10 + 10 = 20, and gets a 20% discount.  20% of 20 is 4, so the discounted price is 20 - 4 = 16.  The total cost for streaming is 10 + 16 = 26 dollars.   To save money, we need to know how much he saves by switching from cable to streaming.  60 - 26 dollars.  That is 34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 394: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Carol spent 4 hours writing a song, half that much time recording it, so 4 / 2 = 2 hours.  4 + 2 = 6 hours in total.  She spent 90 minutes editing, which is 1. 5 hours.  1. 5 hours is what percentage of 6 hours? Let's first convert 6 hours to minutes: 6 * 60 = 360 minutes. 1. 5 hours is 90 minutes.  90 minutes is what percentage of 360 minutes? 90 / 360 = 1 / 4, which is 25%.  So Carol spent 25% of her total work time editing.  The answer is 25%. 
[EXP] 395: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 92, [output]:  Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in the shelving system. 6 * 6 is 36, so the total number of books is 36.

[EXP] 396: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]: typeName the variables:
 Erica started with 20 cards. 
 Her dad brought 2 boxes, each with 15 cards, so that is 2 x 15 = 30 cards. 
 20 + 30 = 50, so Erica has 50 cards.  She gave out 24 + 5 = 29 cards, so she has 50 - 29 = 21 cards left. 
 Then, she received 17 cards, so now she has 21 + 17 = 38 cards.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 397: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 12 is the total number of slices. 1/3 goes to Bill and 1/4 goes to Mark. 1/3 * 12 = 4 slices go to Bill.  1/4 * 12 = 3 slices go to Mark.  So Bill and Mark get 4 + 3 = 7 slices.  Then Jenny eats 2 slices.   In total, 7 + 2 = 9 slices are taken.  So there are 12 - 9 = 3 slices left.   The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 398: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Mark starts with 50 dollars in his bank account.  He earns 10 dollars per day.  We need to figure out how many days it will take him to save enough money to buy the bike, which costs 300 dollars. 

First, we subtract the amount he already has from the amount he needs:

300 - 50 = 250

This means he needs to save 250 dollars more. 

Now, we divide the amount of money he needs to save by the amount he earns per day:

250 / 10 = 25

So, it will take Mark 25 days to save his money and buy the bike.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 399: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 1/3rd of 90 spiders is 90/3 = 30 millipedes.  Twice the number of millipedes is 30 x 2 = 60, and then minus 12 is 60 - 12 = 48. 90 spiders, 30 millipedes, and 48 stink bugs. 90 + 30 + 48 = 168 bugs.  The answer is 168. 
[EXP] 400: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  We know that Erica's age is 30.  Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, Beth's age is 30 + 5 = 35.  And since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, Alice's age is 35 + 7 = 42.  The difference between Alice's age and Erica's age is 42 - 30 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 401: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 1 glass is 8 ounces, so 2 glasses are 2 x 8 = 16 ounces of milk. 1 ounce is 3 calories, so 16 ounces is 16 x 3 = 48 calories.  The answer is 48.

He works for 6 days every week, so in a year he works 6 * 48 = 288 days.  If he gets paid $50 every day, he earns $50 * 288 = $14,400.  The answer is $14,400. 
[EXP] 403: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Mark needs to make a quadruple batch of brownies.  Quadruple 3 cups of flour is 3 x 4 = 12 cups.  Quadruple 1 cup of milk is 1 x 4 = 4 cups.  Mark needs 12 cups of flour and 4 cups of milk.  To buy flour, Mark will need to buy 12/2 = 6 bags of 2-cup bags, so 6 bags of flour.  To buy milk, Mark will need to buy 4/2 = 2 bottles of 2-cup bottles, so 2 bottles of milk.  The difference is 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 6 - 2 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 404: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 81, [output]:  Since Mel uses the air conditioner for 8 hours a day, and each hour uses 900 watts, he uses 8 * 900 = 7200 watts per day.  If he reduces the time by 5 hours, he now uses 3 hours a day. 3 * 900 is 2700 watts per day, so he saves 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts per day.  In 30 days, he will save 4500 * 30 = 135,000 watts.  Since there are 1000 watts/kilowatt, he will save 135,000 / 1000 = 135 kilowatts.  The answer is 135.

Then Allan bought 60 more cannolis and 40 fewer corns.  So the number of cannolis is now 40 + 60 = 100, and the number of corns is 80 - 40 = 40.  So the total number of corns and cannolis is 100 + 40 = 140.  The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 408: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2000, [output]:  Elliott started with a goal of 10,000 steps.  He finished half of that, which is 5,000 steps, on his walks to and from school and another 1,000 steps going for a short walk. 5,000 + 1,000 is 6,000.  So he has 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left.  After his jog, he only has 2,000 steps left.  So he must have taken 4,000 - 2,000 steps during his jog. 4,000 - 2,000 is 2,000.  The answer is 2,000. 
[EXP] 409: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 1.  There are 45 pages in the book. 1 page has 200 words, so there are 45 * 200 = 9000 words in the book. 

2.  Toby can read 300 words in 1 minute, so 9000 words will take him 9000 / 300 = 30 minutes to read. 30 minutes to read + 10 minutes to get to the airport = 40 minutes.  

3.  Toby has 60 minutes before he needs to leave. 60 - 40 = 20.  Toby will be 20 minutes early.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 410: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168000, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  In May, they hired 40 employees and paid each of them $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek.  So they paid each employee 40 hours * $15 = $600 per week.   So total for the month of May, they paid 40 employees * $600 = 24000 dollars.  In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 of 40 employees, or 10 employees.  This left 40 - 10 = 30 employees.   They still paid each employee $600 per week, but now there were 30 employees left.  So in June, they paid 30 employees * $600 = 18000 dollars.  To find the total amount paid in the two months, we need to add the amount paid in May and June: 24000 + 18000 = 42000.  The answer is 42000.

To get the discounted price, we need to find 70% of the original price.  70% of 20 dollars is (20 * 70) / 100 = 14 dollars.  If the price is 14 dollars, Misha is getting 4 blouses for 14 * 4 = 56 dollars.  The answer is 56. 
[EXP] 416: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 350, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:
Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees. 
Her sister gathers twice as many, so her sister gathers 2 x 30 = 60 apples from the tallest trees. 
The total number of apples gathered from the tallest trees is 30 + 60 = 90. 
Joanne gathers half as many apples as she gathers from the tallest trees from the shortest trees, so she gathers 30/2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees.  Her sister gathers three times this amount, so her sister gathers 3 x 15 = 45 apples from the shortest trees.  
The total number of apples gathered from the shortest trees is 15 + 45 = 60.  
The total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees is 90 + 60 = 150.  
The problem states that the sisters have gathered a combined total of 500 apples.  To get the number of apples gathered from the average trees, subtract the total number of apples gathered from the tallest and shortest trees from the total combined: 500 - 150 = 350.  
This is the number of apples the sisters gathered from the average trees.  But we need to find out how many Joanne gathered, since the problem asks for the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees.  Joanne gathered half of the total, so she gathered 350/2 = 175 apples from the average trees.  The answer is 175. 
[EXP] 417: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 56, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that there are 304 bumps.  Camels have two humps each, so the number of camels can be calculated by dividing the total number of bumps by 2:  304 / 2 = 152.  This means there are 152 camels.  To find the number of dromedaries, we can subtract the number of camels from the total number of heads:  180 - 152 = 28.  Since dromedaries have one hump each, and each head corresponds to one camel or one dromedary, the number of dromedaries is equal to the number of heads minus the number of camels.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 418: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3140, [output]:  Tom's trip lasted 14 days.  The first 4 days he traveled 200 km each day.  4 x 200 km is 800 km.  Then he traveled 30% of the distance of the first 4 days over the next two days.  30% of 800 km is 240 km.  So over the next two days, he traveled 240 km.  On the next day, he didn't travel at all.  The last 7 days, he traveled 300 km each day.  7 x 300 km is 2100 km.   In total, Tom traveled 800 km + 240 km + 0 + 2100 km = 3140 km.  The answer is 3140. 
[EXP] 419: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  We know Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches.  We know his locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker, so Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.  We know Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, so Timothy's locker is 2 * 20 = 40 cubic inches.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 420: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3000, [output]:  Stanley was at an elevation of 10,000 feet and the comb fell 4,000 feet, so the comb is at an elevation of 10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000.  Stanley's brother Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet.   So Oliver must climb 6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 feet to reach Stanley's comb.  The answer is 3,000. 
[EXP] 421: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17000, [output]:  Mr.  Josue initially had 5000 dollars.  The first bank gave him 4000 dollars.   If the second company gave twice as much as the first bank, that means it gave him 2 x 4000 = 8000.   His total now is 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000.  The answer is 17000 dollars. 
[EXP] 422: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 50 cats were originally on the rock. 4 boats took away 5 cats each, so that is 4 x 5 = 20 cats taken. 50 - 20 = 30 cats remaining. 3/5 of those remaining cats ran away, which is 30 x 3/5 = 18 cats.  30 - 18 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 423: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 284, [output]:  First, we calculate the cost of the first 6 months. 6 months for $8 a month is 6 x 8 = 48.  Then, there are 8 months at the normal rate of 12 per month.  8 x 12 = 96.   In total, the cost for the first 14 months is 48 + 96 = 144.  The service increased its price to 14 dollars a month after 14 months.   To find the total cost for 2 years (24 months), we need to calculate the cost for the last 10 months (24 - 14 = 10).  10 months for 14 dollars each month is 10 x 14 = 140.  So, the total cost for 2 years is 144 + 140 = 284.  The answer is 284. 
[EXP] 424: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

1.  Tattered jeans cost $28. 
2.  Jogger jeans cost $6 less than tattered jeans, so jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22. 
3.  However, the problem also states that jugger jeans and tattered jeans were both on sale, so Cole saved a total of $6.  
4.  Since Cole saved 1/3 of the savings from the jogger jeans, the amount he saved from the jogger jeans is 1/3 of $6, which is $2.  The rest of the savings, which is $6 - $2 = $4, is from the tattered jeans.  Since he saved $4 from the tattered jeans, and they were originally $28, they actually cost $28 - $4 = $24.  So the jogger jeans cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 425: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 570, [output]: 4 buses can hold 4 x 60 = 240 employees. 6 minibusses can hold 6 x 30 = 180 employees.  10 minivans can hold 10 x 15 = 150 employees.  In total, 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees can join the day trip.  The answer is 570. 
[EXP] 426: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Since Lillian built 3 bird feeders whereas bought 3, she has a total of 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.  Three bird feeders she built attract 3 x 30 (20 + 10) = 90 birds, and 3 store-bought bird feeders attract 3 x 20 = 60 birds.  In total, she can expect to see 90 + 60 = 150 birds in her garden each day.  The answer is 150. 
[EXP] 427: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]: 0 problém, let's analyze the problem step by step!

1.  The bagel costs $4. 
2.  The soup costs 25% more than the bagel, so we need to find 25% of $4 to add to the bagel's price: $4 (bagel) + $1 (25% of $4) = $5 (soup).  So soup costs $5. 3.   The cake is half the price of the bagel: $4 (bagel) / 2 = $2 (cake). 4.  To find the total cost, we add the prices together: $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.  The answer is $11. 
[EXP] 428: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 150, [output]: 50 dollars is left after buying a ticket to the amusement park.  He went there with 50 dollars in cash.  But that's after buying the ticket.  The ticket cost 100 dollars.  So he must have had 100 + 50 = 150 dollars initially.  Now, we know that he sold the cards for 1. 5 each.   So he started with a whole number of cards to make 150.  When you divide 150 by 1. 5, you get 100.  But he only kept 1/3 of his cards.  This means he had 3 * 100 = 300 cards initially.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 429: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 36 guests were supposed to attend and have 1 hotdog each.  The caterer prepared enough for half of them to have 2 hotdogs.  Half of 36 is 18.  So, for 36 guests, the caterer prepared 36 + 18 = 54 hotdogs. 

40 guests showed up instead.  Each guest wanted a second hotdog, so the total number of hotdogs required is 40 * 2 = 80.  However, the caterer only had 54 hotdogs.   So, 80 - 54 hotdogs were needed, which is 26 hotdogs.  These 26 hotdogs went to the first 26 guests, leaving no hotdog for the remaining 14 guests.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 430: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Indras has 6 letters in her name.  Half of 6 is 6/2 = 3. 4 more letters than that would be 4 + 3 = 7 letters.  So her sister's name has 7 letters.  The answer to Indras' name is still 6 letters and the answer to her sister's name is 7 letters. 
[EXP] 431: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 132, [output]:  Let's first calculate the cost of the order without the 20% discount.  A set of pot and pans is $120, a set of mixing bowls is $20, and 5 utensils at $5 each is 5 * 5 = 25.  In total, the order is $120 + $20 + $25 = $165.  A 20% discount is like having $33 removed from the total.  $165 - $33 is $132.  The answer is 132. 
[EXP] 432: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Dora has a total of 2 + 16 = 18 dollars.  The total cost of the items is 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 dollars.  Dora needs 19 - 18 = 1 dollar to buy the items.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 433: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.  Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, so he slew 3/4 * 100 = 75 dragons.  Prince Walter slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, so he slew 2 * 75 = 150 dragons.  Finally, Prince Bruce slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, so he slew 1/5 * 150 = 30 dragons.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 434: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 15 gallons were divided into 5 containers, so each container had 15 / 5 = 3 gallons of gas.  Since Josey needed 1/4 of a container, she needed 3 * 1/4 = 3/4 gallons.  There are 8 pints in a gallon, so 3/4 * 8 = 6 pints.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 435: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 40 cents for chips and 75 cents for candy bars.  George spent 5 dollars.  Let's first convert the 5 dollars to cents.  Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, George spent 5 x 100 = 500 cents. 

He had 1% of his money left, which means he spent 99% of his money.  99% of 500 cents is 99 / 100 x 500 = 495 cents.   Since he got 3 bags of chips (40 cents each), he spent a total of 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.  

That leaves 495 - 120 = 375 cents.  Since candy bars cost 75 cents each, we divide 375 by 75 to get the number of candy bars he bought. 375 / 75 = 5.   George bought 5 candy bars.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 436: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Ray started with 25 lollipops.  He kept 5 for himself, so he has 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops left.  Since he shared the remaining 20 lollipops equally with 4 friends, each friend received 20 / 4 = 5 lollipops.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 437: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 15, [output]: 20 ounces of cake are cut into 8 pieces.  That means each piece is 20 / 8 = 2. 5 ounces.  Rory and her mom each have one piece, so 2 pieces are gone.  That leaves 8 - 2 = 6 pieces.  The remaining cake weighs 6 x 2. 5 ounces = 12. 5 ounces.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 438: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Sitti had 34 oranges.  Juris had 22 oranges.  So in total they had 34 + 22 = 56 oranges.  They are sharing them with 6 friends, in addition to themselves.   So there are 6 + 2 = 8 people.   If they divide the 56 oranges equally, they will divide 56 ÷ 8 = 7 oranges among themselves.  This will be the number of oranges each person will get.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 439: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Antoine needs 4 pounds of onions because he wants to double the recipe.  For the onions, he will spend 4 x 2 = 8 dollars.  For the beef stock, he needs 2 boxes, so 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.   In total, he will spend 8 + 4 = 12 dollars.   The soup serves 6 people.  The cost per serving is 12 / 6 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 440: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Wayne is staying at a hotel, and Bernadette is staying at her high-rise apartment.  The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes 4 times longer than the drive from Wayne's hotel.  The drive from Wayne's hotel takes 4 minutes.  So, the drive from Bernadette's apartment will be 4 x 4 = 16 minutes.  They want Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.  So Bernadette should leave 5 minutes before Wayne leaves.  Wayne can leave 4 minutes before the event, so Bernadette should leave 9 minutes (5 + 4) before the event.  Bernadette should leave 9 minutes before Wayne leaves.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 441: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 98, [output]: 1 yard is 3 feet.  So the length of Billie's room in feet is 3 x 3 = 9 feet.  Since the area of the room is 360 square feet, we can calculate the width of the room by dividing the area by the length.  360 / 9 = 40, so the width of the room is 40 feet.  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2 * (length + width).  In this case, the perimeter is 2 * (9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98 feet.  The answer is 98. 
[EXP] 442: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's list the amount of beads each sister has:
* Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads + 2 packs of clear beads = 1 x 20 + 2 x 20 = 60 beads
* Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads + 4 packs of red beads = 3 x 20 + 4 x 20 = 100 beads

To find out how many more beads Margareth has, we subtract Elizabeth's beads from Margareth's beads:
100 - 60 = 40

So Margareth has 40 more beads than Elizabeth.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 443: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 49, [output]:  Marcus's house starts at 40 degrees.  For 3 hours, it warms up by 5 degrees per hour, for a total of 15 degrees. 40 + 15 = 55.  Then, the window is open for 30 minutes, and it cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes. 30 / 10 = 3, so 3 * 2 = 6 degrees. 55 - 6 is 49.  The answer is 49. 
[EXP] 444: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 59, [output]:  Let's first find the total time it took Jon.   
The swim took Jon 40 minutes, the bike ride took 1 hour 20 minutes which is 80 minutes, and the run took 50 minutes.  So Jon's total time is 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes. 

Now let's figure out how long it took James.  The swim took James 10% less than Jon's time.  10% less than 40 minutes is 40 - (10/100*40) = 36 minutes.  The bike ride took James 5 minutes longer than Jon's time which is 85 minutes.   The total time it took James for the swim and bike ride is 36 + 85 = 121 minutes.  Since Jon finished 10 minutes ahead of James, the total time it took James also has to be the same as Jon's total time minus 10 minutes.  That is 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.   So the run took James 160 - 121 = 39 minutes.   The answer is 39 minutes. 
[EXP] 445: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Movie C was 1. 25 hours, which is 1. 25 * 60 = 75 minutes.  Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie  C, so Movie  B was 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.  Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B.  One-fourth of 80 is 80 / 4 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 446: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 1/2 a bail of hay is needed for every mile.  Since the horse runs for 30 minutes, at 32MPH, that is 30 / 60 * 32 = 16 miles.  16 miles requires 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.   Each bail of hay costs $3, so Michael will spend 8 * 3 = 24 dollars.  Michael started with 6 * 5 = 30 dollars in his wallet and spent 24, so he has 30 - 24 = 6 dollars left.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 447: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs that were in cases.   1 dozen is 12, so 4 dozen is 4 x 12 = 48 eggs.  She also uses 2 loose eggs.  So in total she uses 50 eggs.  Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so she can make 50/5 glasses of eggnog.  50/5 is 10.   The glasses are poured into trays that each hold 5 glasses of eggnog.  So Rozanne can put out 10/5 trays of eggnog.  10/5 is 2.   The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 448: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Joey started with 214 points.  He scored 26 points, so now he has 214 + 26 = 240 points.  Marcy had 225 points initially and scored 10 more points, so she now has 225 + 10 = 235 points.  To find out the difference between Joey and Marcy, we subtract Marcy's points from Joey's points: 240 - 235 = 5.  So Joey is winning by 5 points.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 449: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 539, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576.  After selling 17 at a flash sale for $20 each, he got 17 x 20 = 340 dollars.  

He has 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers left.  These were sold to the department store for 25 dollars each. 31 x 25 = 775 dollars. 

Total money the salesman got from selling sneakers is 340 + 775 = 1115 dollars.  The initial cost was 576 dollars, so the profit is 1115 - 576 = 539 dollars. 

The answer is 539.

[EXP] 451: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4, [output]: 12 + price of popcorn + 3 = 20. 20 - (12 + 3) = 20 - 15 = 5.  But the problem says you saved 2 dollars, so the correct calculation is 12 + price of popcorn + 3 = 20 - 2, which is 18. 18 - 12 - 3 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 452: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11050, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

The total cost of filling 20 balloons was $900.  So the cost of filling 1 balloon is $900 ÷ 20 = $45. 

Two days later, the cost of each balloon increased by $20, so the new cost of filling 1 balloon is $45 + $20 = $65. 

Now, we need to find the cost of filling 170 balloons after the price increase.  The cost of filling 1 balloon is $65, so the cost of filling 170 balloons is $65 * 170 = $11,050.  The answer is $11,050. 
[EXP] 453: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  The car drove 60 mph for 2 hours. 60 * 2 = 120 miles.  Then it drove 30 mph for 1 hour.  30 * 1 = 30 miles.  In total, it drove 120 + 30 miles. 120 + 30 is 150 miles.   The time it took is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.  To get the average speed, we divide the distance by the time. 150 / 3 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 454: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6400, [output]:  Jenna has 8 sapphires.  She trades 3 for 2 rubies.  So she now has 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires and 2 rubies.  The value of the rubies is 2 x $1200 = $2400.  And the value of the remaining 5 sapphires is 5 x $800 = $4000.  In total, the value of all her jewels is $2400 + $4000 = $6400.  The answer is $6400. 
[EXP] 455: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day.  To find the total number of apples they eat together each day, you multiply 4 by 2: 4 x 2 = 8.  So they eat 8 apples per day.  In 30 days, they will eat 8 x 30 = 240 apples.  The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 456: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1920, [output]:  To find the volume of soil needed, multiply the length, width, and height of each raised bed. 2 * 8 * 2 = 32 cubic feet. 10 raised beds is 32 * 10 = 320 cubic feet.  320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet per bag = 160 bags of potting soil.  Each bag costs 12 dollars, so 160 bags will cost 160 * 12 = 1920 dollars.  The answer is 1920. 
[EXP] 457: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]:  There are originally 15 red cards.  There are 60% more green cards.  60% of 15 is 0. 60 * 15 = 9.  So there are 9 more green cards than red cards.  15 + 9 = 24 green cards.  Yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards, so yellow cards are also 15 + 24 = 39.  In total, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards of all colors.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 458: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 50 fairies were initially flying above the nearby forest. 1/2 that is 25 fairies flew in, so there are now 50 + 25 = 75 fairies. 30 fairies flew away, so there are 75 - 30 = 45 fairies remaining.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 459: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  First, let's find the total number of puppies.  Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies.  Brandon's dog has 12 puppies.   Therefore, 8 + 12 = 20 puppies in total.  Now, we add the number of spotted puppies.  Jennifer's dog has 3 with spots.  Brandon's dog has 4 with spots.   Therefore, 3 + 4 = 7 puppies with spots.   To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100:

(7/20) * 100 = 35

So, 35% of the puppies have spots.  The answer is 35. 
[EXP] 460: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 1. 1-pound box of sugar cubes: for 2 boxes, we have 2 x 1 = 2 pounds. 2.  12-pound bag of carrots: for 4 bags, we have 4 x 12 = 48 pounds.  3.  75-pound bale of hay: for 42 bales, we have 42 x 75 = 3150 pounds.  4.  65-pound sack of oats: for 20 sacks, we have 20 x 65 = 1300 pounds. 

Adding together the weights of all the items, we get 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3500 pounds.  Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, we need to know how many 2250-pound loads are needed to fit all the feed. 3500 / 2250 = 1. 55 demand a second truck.  1. 55 can't be carried in a truck, so we round up to 2 trips.  The answer is 2.

[EXP] 466: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Miss Maria had 6 decks with 25 basketball cards in each deck, so she had 6 * 25 = 150 basketball cards.  She also had 5 boxes with 40 baseball cards in each box, so she had 5 * 40 = 200 baseball cards.  In total, she had 150 + 200 = 350 cards.  She gave away some cards, so she must have given away 350 - 50 = 300 cards.  Her students got 10 cards each, so we have to divide 300 by 10 to get the number of students.  300 ÷ 10 = 30 students.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 467: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  First let's calculate how much Becky paid. 
Becky paid 20 apples for 45 cents each, which is 20 x 45 cents = 900 cents = $9.  With a 1 dollar discount, Becky paid $9 - $1 = $8. 

Now, let's calculate how much Kelly paid. 
Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, which is 20 x 50 cents = 1000 cents = $10.  With a 10% discount, Kelly paid 10% of $10 which is 10% x $10 = $1.  So Kelly paid $10 - $1 = $9.  To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we find $9 - $8 = $1.  The answer is $1. 
[EXP] 468: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1200, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  Each room has:

* 2 sheets
* 1 comforter
* Twice as many pillow cases as sheets: 2 x 2 = 4 pillow cases
* Twice as many towels as pillow cases: 2 x 4 = 8 towels

So, for each room, there are 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 pieces of laundry.  For 80 rooms, there will be 15 * 80 = 1200 pieces of laundry.  The answer is 1200.

The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 474: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  A remora is a type of fish that attaches to a shark.  The problem says there are 2 remoras, each 6 inches long, attached to a 10-foot shark.  First, we need to convert the length of the shark from feet to inches.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so the shark is 10 x 12 = 120 inches long.  The remoras are 6 x 2 = 12 inches long.  To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is the combined length of the remoras, we can divide the length of the remoras by the length of the shark, then multiply by 100: (12 / 120) * 100 = 10%.  The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 475: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]: 3/4 of the students have a desktop computer. 1/4 do not.  So the 20 students that do not have desktop computers are 1/4 of the total.  If 1/4 are 20 students, then the total number of students is 20 * 4 = 80.  The answer is 80.

The answer is $15,400. 
[EXP] 481: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Ben has 4 tubes of blue paint and 3 tubes of yellow paint, so the total number of tubes of paint Ben has is 4 + 3 = 7.  Jasper has half as many tubes of blue paint as Ben, so Jasper has 4 ÷ 2 = 2 tubes of blue paint.  Jasper has three times as many tubes of yellow paint as Ben, so Jasper has 3 x 3 = 9 tubes of yellow paint.   Therefore, the total number of tubes of paint Jasper has is 2 + 9 = 11.  The answer is 11.

[EXP] 484: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Gabriel has 20 songs on his player.  Luri has 3 times as many songs, so Luri has 3 x 20 = 60 songs on his player.  To find out how many songs each can add to their player, we need to find the capacity of their players (100 - the number of songs already on the player).  For Gabriel, that is 100 - 20 = 80.  For Luri, that is 100 - 60 = 40.  To find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we need to subtract the number of songs he can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.  80 - 40 = 40.  The answer is 40.

[EXP] 488: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Uncle Ben has 4 horses.  Each horse eats 5 pounds of oats twice a day, so that's 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per horse per day.  For all horses, that's 4 * 10 = 40 pounds of oats per day.  For 5 days, that's 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.   One bag contains 50 pounds of oats, so Uncle Ben needs 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 489: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 2/3 of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, so the number of Pomeranians is 2/3 * 27 = 18. 1/3 of these 18 Pomeranians are girls, so the number of girl Pomeranians is 1/3 * 18 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 490: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: -10, [output]:  Let's first add all the temperatures: -48 + 21 + -3 = -30.  To find the average, we divide by the number of countries. 3 countries so we divide by 3.  -30 ÷ 3 = -10.  The answer is -10. 
[EXP] 491: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 8-year-old child wants to buy a toy car which costs 12 dollars.  He already has 4 dollars.  So he needs to save 12 - 4 = 8 more dollars.  He promises to save 2 dollars daily.  To calculate how many days he will take to save the remaining amount, we can divide 8 by 2. 8 / 2 = 4.   So it will take him 4 days to save the remaining amount of money.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 492: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Jaime will be able to place 2 * 24 = 48 eggs. 64 - 48 = 16 eggs, which are left after placing the full trays.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 493: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Sally bought one small pizza that costs $8. 1 family-size pizza costs 3 times as much, so it costs 8 * 3 = 24.  In total, she spent 8 + 24 = 32 dollars.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 494: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 2 packs of razors are being bought, and each pack comes with 4 razors.  So, Heather is buying a total of 2 * 4 = 8 razors. 

Each pack costs 4 dollars, so 2 packs will cost 2 * 4 = 8 dollars.  With the buy one get one free deal, she'll only be paying for one pack, which is 4 dollars.  After using the 2 dollar coupon, she'll be paying 4 - 2 = 2 dollars in total.  That's 200 cents. 

To find the price of each individual razor, we need to divide the total cost by the number of razors. 200 cents / 8 razors = 25 cents per razor.  The answer is 25 cents. 
[EXP] 495: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 21, [output]: 9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall. 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.  The total height of the 9 cheerleaders who are 64" tall is 9 x 64 = 576 inches.   Since the 10th cheerleader is 60" tall, the total height of all 10 cheerleaders is 576 + 60 = 636 inches. 

However, we need to find the height of the human pyramid in feet.  We need to convert the height from inches to feet.  There are 12 inches in 1 foot.  So 636 inches is equal to 636 / 12 = 53 feet.  



We are building the human pyramid.  It has 4 girls at the base.   Then 3 more above the base.  Then 2 more above those.  Then the shortest girl, 60" tall, is at the top.  We can add the heights as follows:
The base: 4 * 64" = 256"
The middle layer: the 3 girls above the base are 3 * 64" = 192"
The next layer: the 2 girls above the middle layer are 2 * 64" = 128"
The top layer: the 1 girl above the next layer is 60" tall
Total height of the pyramid: 256" + 192" + 128" + 60" = 636"
This is the same as we found before: 636" is the same as 53 feet.  The answer is 53.

The answer is 200. 
[EXP] 497: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 38, [output]:  There is no problem to solve about trees or cars, so let's start fresh.  Brett is 14 years old.  In 4 years, his sister Angela will be three times as old as he is now.  So in 4 years, Brett will be 14 + 4 = 18 years old.   And Angela will be 3 times 18, or 3 x 18 = 54 years old.  So if Angela will be 54 years old in 4 years, she is currently 54 - 4 = 50 years old.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 498: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 112, [output]:  Paul drives his car twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  So for each day, he spends 6 + 2 = 8 dollars.  For two weeks, he spends the 8 dollars for 14 days.   8 x 14 = 112.  The answer is 112. 
[EXP] 499: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Ashley brought 5 boxes with 10 oranges each, so in total she brought 5 x 10 = 50 oranges.  Brianne brought 20 more than Ashley, so she brought 50 + 20 = 70 oranges.  Together, they have 50 + 70 = 120 oranges.   One pie needs 3 oranges, so they can make 120 / 3 = 40 pies.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 500: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the total cost for each venue when X guests attend:

**First venue:**

* Flat fee: $200
* Food for X guests: $5 x X

Total cost = $200 + 5X

**Second venue:**

* Food for X guests is already included, so we only need to consider the $25 per person charge. 
* Total cost = 25X

For the two venues to be equal in cost, we set up the equation:

$200 + 5X = 25X

Subtracting 5X from both sides:

200 = 20X

Dividing both sides by 20:

10 = X

So, the venues would be equal in cost when 10 guests attend.  Mark needs 10 guests to attend for the two venues to be equal in cost.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 501: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's start by letting Bodhi's insect collection equal the variable "x". 

Since David found half of what Bodhi found, David's insect collection is equal to x/2.  Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily's insect collection is equal to x/2 + 7. 

The total number of insects collected by the three of them is 43.  This is equal to the sum of Lily, David, and Bodhi's insect collections.  

So, we can set up the equation: 

x + (x/2) + (x/2 + 7) = 43 

Combine like terms:

x + x/2 + x/2 + 7 = 43 

Simplify by combining the like terms:

3x/2 +7 = 43 

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x/2 = 36 

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

3x = 72 

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 24 

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find Lily's insect collection.  Lily found 7 more than David, and David found half of what Bodhi found.  Bodhi found 24 insects, so David found 24/2 = 12 insects.  Lily found 12 + 7 = 19 insects. 

The answer is 19.

2.  The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.  Twice the width of the rug is 2 x 8 = 16 feet.  The length of the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 505: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start by breaking down the problem:

Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total:

* 2 packs of strawberry gum
* 1 pack of grape gum
* 1 pack of green apple gum

She paid a total of $7 for all the packs. 

Let's say the cost of a pack of strawberry gum is x.  Since she bought 2 packs, the total cost of the strawberry gum is 2x.  She also paid $2 for the grape gum, and half as much for the green apple gum, which is $1. 

The total amount she paid is the sum of the costs of all the packs:
2x + 2 + 1 = 7

Combining like terms:
2x + 3 = 7

Subtract 3 from both sides:
2x = 4

Divide both sides by 2:
x = 2

So, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 506: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1,600, [output]: 24 dollars is available to buy wood. 2 x 4 piece of wood costs 4 dollars and 2 x 8 piece of wood costs 6 dollars.  The cheapest wood Frederick can buy is a 2 x 4 because it costs 4 dollars and 4 dollars is less than 6 dollars.  The maximum number of sticks Frederick can get from a 2 x 4 is 200.  He can buy as many 2 x 4's as his money can buy.  24 / 4 is 6, so he can buy 6 2 x 4 pieces of wood.   Each 2 x 4 gives 200 sticks. 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.  The answer is 1200. 
[EXP] 507: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]: bootstrapcdn.  Each dog has 4 legs, and each pair of snowshoes is needed for 2 legs.  So each dog needs 2 pairs of snowshoes.  In total, Mario needs 6 dogs times 2 pairs of snowshoes per dog = 12 pairs of snowshoes.  Each pair of snowshoes costs 12 dollars, so 12 pairs cost 12 x 12 = 144 dollars.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 508: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Janet takes 2 bus trips per day and 5 days a week, so she takes 2 x 5 = 10 bus trips per week. 10 bus trips at $2. 20 each will be 10 x 2. 20 = 22 dollars per week. 22 dollars is how much it would cost her if she didn't buy a weekly pass.  Since she got a weekly pass for $20, she saved 22 - 20 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 509: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm has.  Since the farm has 30 cows, the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows.   The zoo has 20 sheep and the farm has half as many, so the farm has 20 / 2 = 10 sheep. 

The farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep, so in total, it has 30 + 10 = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep, so in total, it has 60 + 20 = 80 animals.  The total number of animals is the sum of the farm and the zoo.  40 + 80 = 120.   The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 510: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: <|reserved_special_token_63|>

Let's say Sophia bought x amount of onions and potatoes.  Since Rose bought 4 times as many, she bought 4x onions and potatoes. 

We are told that Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 12 (onions) and 4x = 4 (potatoes)

Now we can solve for x.  For the onions, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 12/4
x = 3

So Sophia bought 3 onions.  

For the potatoes, we divide both sides by 4:

x = 4/4
x = 1

So Sophia bought 1 potato.  In total, Sophia bought 3 onions and 1 potato.  The answer is 4.

[EXP] 514: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Julie started with 500 dollars. 20% of 500 is 0. 20 * 500 = 100.  So she spent 100 dollars on clothes. 500 - 100 = 400 is what she has left.  Then 25% of 400 is 0. 1/4 * 400 = 100.  So she spent 100 more. 400 - 100 = 300 dollars.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 515: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 90000, [output]:  Let's assume the cost of the lot is x dollars. 

Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x.  Together, the cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, so we can set up the equation: x + 3x = 120,000. 

Combine like terms: 4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4: x = 30,000

So the cost of the lot is $30,000, and the cost of the house is 3x = 3(30,000) = $90,000.  The answer is 90,000. 
[EXP] 516: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Tara bought 8 packs of 5 bags, so she bought a total of 8 x 5 = 40 bags. 40 bags for $4 each is a total of 40 x 4 = 160 dollars.  She sold each bag for $8, so 40 bags at $8 each is 40 x 8 = 320 dollars.   So her profit came from selling $320 worth of bags, which was bought for $160.  Her profit is 320 - 160 = 160.  The answer is 160. 
[EXP] 517: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 375, [output]:  Joe throws 25 punches per minute. 5 rounds of 3 minutes each means a total of 5 x 3 = 15 minutes.  In those 15 minutes, he threw 25 punches per minute.  So in total he threw 25 x 15 = 375 punches.  The answer is 375. 
[EXP] 518: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  Suzanne made 36 cookies.  Josh made one-fourth of that, so he made 36 / 4 = 9 cookies.  
Since Kelsie made 2 times more cookies than Josh, she made 9 * 2 = 18 cookies.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 519: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 4 x 10 = 40. 6 x 20 = 120. 40 + 120 = 160.  Ali gives his sister half of 160, so he gives 160 / 2 = 80 to his sister. 160 - 80 = 80, so he has 80 dollars remaining.  3/5 of 80 is 48. 80 - 48 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 520: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 280, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!


Rob takes 2 hours or 120 minutes to shingle a house.  Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob, so first we calculate double Rob's time.  Double Rob's time is 120 * 2 = 240 minutes. 


Royce takes 40 minutes more than this, so we add 40 to 240.  240 + 40 = 280.  The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 521: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 63, [output]:  For each grandchild, Martha will need:

* 1 hat: 2 skeins
* 1 scarf: 4 skeins
* 1 sweater: 12 skeins
* 1 pair of mittens: 1 skein
* 1 pair of socks: 2 skeins

Total skeins for each grandchild: 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, the total number of skeins she will need is: 21 skeins per grandchild x 3 grandkids = 63 skeins

The answer is 63. 
[EXP] 522: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 39, [output]:  Chris had 100 math problems. 12 were completed on Monday. 3 times the number of problems he completed on Monday means he completed 3 * 12 = 36 problems on Tuesday. 12 + 36 = 48 problems were completed on Monday and Tuesday. 100 - 48 = 52 math problems remained. 1/4 of 52 is 13.  So 13 problems were completed on Wednesday. 52 - 13 = 39 math problems remain.  The answer is 39. 
[EXP] 523: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]: 1.  Tony can pick 6 quarts in an hour
    2.  Bobby picks one less quart than Tony.  So Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts in an hour. 
    3.  Kathy can pick twice as much as Bobby.  So Kathy can pick 5 x 2 = 10 quarts in an hour. 4.   Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy.   So Ricky can pick 10 - 2 = 8 quarts in an hour. 
    5.  Combining the work of Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky in an hour
         - Tony can pick 6 quarts
         - Bobby can pick 5 quarts
         - Kathy can pick 10 quarts
         - Ricky can pick 8 quarts
       - That is 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 524: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 74, [output]: 200 loaves of bread were baked initially.  93 loaves were sold in the morning, leaving 200 - 93 = 107 loaves.  Then, 39 loaves were sold in the afternoon, leaving 107 - 39 = 68 loaves.  After receiving 6 loaves back from the grocery store, they had 68 + 6 = 74 loaves of bread left.  The answer is 74. 
[EXP] 525: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jackson starts with 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips. 36 / 6 = 6 rows of red tulips. 24 / 8 = 3 rows of blue tulips. 6 + 3 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 526: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 12, [output]: 27 cups of raisins are in the bag.  A batch of oatmeal cookies takes 3/4 cup of raisins.  So for each batch, 3/4 cup of raisins are taken.  To find out how many batches of cookies can be made, we need to divide 27 cups of raisins by 3/4 cup.  We can do this by inverting 3/4, which is 4/3.  27 x (4/3) = 36.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 527: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]: 1.  First, find out how many kilowatts per day the device will consume.  Since it's a new device adding to her daily consumption, we add 2 kilowatts per hour to her original 12 kilowatts per hour. 12 + 2 = 14. 

2.   Calculate her daily consumption, including the new device, in dollars: 14 kilowatts per hour * $1. 50 per kilowatt per hour = $21 per day.  Since it's a weekly bill, we multiply by 7 days: $21 * 7 = $147 per week.  Before the device, her consumption was 12 kilowatts per hour, which is equally $18 per day or $126 per week.  Find the difference between these two weekly bills: $147 - $126 = $21.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 528: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 1 person can paint half a house in 5 days. 1 person can paint 1/2 / 5 = 1/10 of a house per day.  

To paint the whole house, 10/10 of a house needs to be painted.  

If 1 person can paint 1/10 of a house in a day, then 5 people can paint 5 x 1/10 of a house in a day = 1/2 of a house in a day. 

So to paint the whole house (1), it will take 1 / (1/2) = 2 days. 2 days consist of 2 x 24 = 48 hours.  The answer is 48 hours. 
[EXP] 529: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 172, [output]:  Ophelia has 20 sofas.  Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than Ophelia, so Jenna has 20 - 2 = 18 sofas.  Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, so we need to find out how many chairs Ophelia has.  Let's call that number x.  Jenna's chair number is 3 times that, so 3x.  Ophelia has 2 fewer chairs, so we can write: x - 2 = 3x Jenna has 18 sofas, and Ophelia has 20, so the total number of sofas is 20 + 18 = 38 Latex math equation:  x - 2 = 3x Latex math equation: x = 6 So Ophelia has 6 chairs and Jenna has 3 * 6 = 18 chairs.  Together they have 38 sofas and 6 + 18 = 24 chairs.  The total number of Sofas and chairs is 38 + 24 = 62.  The answer is 62. 
[EXP] 530: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Tom started with 48 dollars. 4 dollars went to the CD. 48 - 4 = 44 dollars left. 44/4 = 11.  Tom could have bought 11 more CDs.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 531: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 36, [output]: 8 weeks in total. 4 hours per week for most of the weeks.  
For the occasion where Josh spent 5 hours for 2 consecutive weeks, it will be 5 * 2 = 10 hours.  There was another week where he spent 6 hours. 10 + 6 = 16 hours in those 2 extra non-4 hour weeks. 

Multiply 4 hours per week by 6 weeks (most of the 8) to get 4 * 6 = 24 hours. 24 for the regular weeks plus 16 hours for the irregular weeks gives a total of 24 + 16 = 40 hours.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 532: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 66, [output]: 48 people are riding the bus originally.  After 8 get off, there are 48 - 8 = 40 left.  Then, 5 times as many people get on (5 x 8 = 40), so then there are 40 + 40 = 80 people.  On the second stop, 21 get off.   So there are 80 - 21 = 59 left.   Then, 3 times fewer people get on than the number who got off.  21 ÷ 3 = 7, so 7 people get on.  Then there are 59 + 7 = 66 people.  The answer is 66. 
[EXP] 533: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Jame will be 27 in 5 years.  That means he is 27 - 5 = 22 years old now. 

In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age in 8 years.  That means his cousin's age in 8 years will be 2 * (Jame's age in 8 years) - 5. 

First, calculate Jame's age in 8 years: 22 + 8 = 30. 

Now, calculate his cousin's age in 8 years: 2 * 30 - 5 = 55 - 5 = 50.  So his cousin will be 50 in 8 years.  If his cousin is 50 in 8 years, then he is 50 - 8 = 42 years old now. 

To find the difference between their ages, subtract 22 from 42: 42 - 22 = 20.  

The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 534: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Errol paid $400 less for the printer than the computer.  The computer cost $1,100.  So the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700.   The total cost for the entire set was $2,400.   If the computer cost $1,100 and the printer cost $700, then the 2 monitors must have cost $2,400 - ($1,100 + $700).  Simplifying, this is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600.  Since there are 2 monitors, each monitor must have cost $600 ÷ 2 = $300.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 535: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]: 20 kids went out on the school trip.  They were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.  Let's assume both groups contain 10 kids.  The boys brought back 60 shells each.  Since there are 10 boys, they brought back 10 x 60 = 600 shells.  The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.  The number of shells brought by the boys is 600, so the amount the girls brought is 600 + (4 x 600) = 600 + 2400 = 3000.   Since there are 10 girls, they brought back 3000 / 10 = 300 shells each.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 536: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Nick had twice as many candies as George. 2 times G = N, where G is the number of candies George had, and N is the number of candies Nick had.  George ate 5 candies, so now George has 3 candies left.  2G - 5 = 3.  We need to find G first.  Add 5 to both sides to get 2G = 8.   Dividing both sides by 2, we get G = 4.  So Nick had 2 times 4 candies.  2 x 4 = 8.   The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 537: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  We need to figure out how old Alyana is first.  Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny.  Chenny is 10, so Alyana is 10 - 4 = 6.  If Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, then Anne is 6 + 2 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 538: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 188, [output]:  The first book is 31 mm thick.  The second book is 50 mm thick.   The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so the third book is 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick.  The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so the fourth book is 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.  The total thickness is 31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm.  The answer is 188. 
[EXP] 539: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Emma starts with a monthly goal of 72 vlogs.  In the first three weeks she made a total of 18 + 21 + 15 = 54 vlogs.  So she still needs to make 72 - 54 = 18 vlogs to complete the 72 vlogs per month.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 540: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 35, [output]: 50 dollars is the initial dinner bill.  To find out the additional 20% tip, I need to calculate 20% of 50. 20% is 1/5. 50 * 1/5 = 10.  So the additional tip is 10 dollars.  The total amount I ended up paying is 50 + 10 = 60 dollars.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 541: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 39, [output]: 18 dollars is shared among 3 boys, so each boy gets 18/3 = 6 dollars.  Then the eldest had 6 dollars.  After adding 5 more, he had 6 + 5 = 11 dollars.  He added 10 dollars more, so he had 11 + 10 = 21 dollars.   Then he spent 8 dollars, so he had 21 - 8 = 13 dollars.   After tripling this amount, he now has 13 * 3 = 39 dollars.  The answer is 39. 
[EXP] 542: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 30 days in April are divided into two halves - first half (1-15) and second half (16-30). 

To determine how much Elvis needs to save per day in the second half to hit his target, we first need to determine how much he has to save per day in the first half to hit his target. 1125 divided by 15 days = 75 dollars per day to save in the first half.  Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, he needs to save 2 * 75 = 150 dollars per day in the second half.  The answer is 150. 
[EXP] 543: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  First, let's calculate the total cost of the fruit:

* 3 apples at $1. 50 each = 3 x $1. 50 = $4.  50
* 5 oranges at $0.  80 each = 5 x $0.  80 = $4.  00
* 6 peaches at $0.  75 each = 6 x $0.  75 = $4.  50
* Total cost = $4.  50 + $4.   00 + $4.   50 = $13.  00

She gave $20, so she received a change of:

$20 - $13.  00 = $7.  00

The answer is $7. 
[EXP] 544: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  For each task, Jairus gets $0. 8 and Jenny gets $0. 5.  If Jairus finished 20 tasks, he will get  20 * $0. 8 = $ 16.   If Jenny finished 20 tasks, she will get  20 * $0. 5 = $ 10.  To find out how much more Jairus got than Jenny, subtract Jenny's total from Jairus's total: $16 - $10 = $6.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 545: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Jeff and Brad are trying to divide 100 dollars between them.  The amount Brad gets is B and Jeff gets 4B.  Since they are dividing all the money, B + 4B = 100.  Simplifying gives 5B = 100. 5B / 5 = 100 / 5, so B = 20.  Jeff gets 4B, which is 4 x 20 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 546: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Jeff walks 3 miles each way for each workday, so he walks 3 + 3 = 6 miles each day.  He has to work 5 times a week, so the total miles he walks is 5 * 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 547: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130, [output]: 26 letters in the full alphabet, for a total of 2 x 26 = 52 letters. 13 letters in half the alphabet. 52 + 13 = 65 letters.  She writes this all again, adding another 65 letters. 65 + 65 = 130.  The answer is 130. 
[EXP] 548: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 81, [output]:  The first round, Ali called 3 families. 

The second round, each of the 3 families he called the 3 other families they know. 3 x 3 = 9. 

The third round, each of the 9 families called the 3 other families they know. 9 x 3 = 27.  

The fourth round, each of the 27 families will call 3 other families they know. 27 x 3 = 81.  The answer is 81. 
[EXP] 549: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Mark lost 10 pounds per month, for 3 months.  So he lost a total of 10 x 3 = 30 pounds.  He now weighs 70 pounds, which is 30 pounds less than his initial weight.  To find his initial weight, add 30 pounds back to 70 pounds.  70 + 30 = 100.   The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 550: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 398, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information given: Jonathan has some toys and he needs 2 more to make a set that is five times larger than James's set. 80 toys make James's set.  So, the set Jonathan needs is 5 * 80 = 400.  Jonathan needs 2 more than he already has to make this set.  Let's say he has x toys.  Then, x + 2 = 400.  To find x, we subtract 2 from both sides: x = 400 - 2.  x = 398.  So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.  The answer is 398. 
[EXP] 551: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 27, [output]: 5 notebooks at $1. 50 each will cost 5 x 1. 50 = $7. 50.  2 pens at $0.  25 each will cost 2 x 0.  25 = $0.  50.  1 calculator at $12 each will cost $12.  1 geometry set at $10 will cost $10.  The total amount of money before discount is $20.   The discount is 10%, so we need to find 10% of $20, which is (0.  10 x $20) = $2.  After discount, the amount of money Daniel needs to spend is $20 - $2 = $18.   The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 552: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Carly started with a $50 bill.  She bought 5 hamburgers for $4 each, so that is $4 * 5 = $20.  She bought 10 packs of potato fries at 30 cents each, so that is 30 * 10 = $3.  And she bought 5 cans of fruit drinks for $2 each, so that is 2 * 5 = $10.   In total, she spent $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.   If she gives the $50 bill, she will get 50 - 33 = 17 dollars back.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 553: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 450, [output]: 30% of $1000 is $300. 30% of $1000 is a commission on the first $1000 she sold. 10% of the remaining amount is a commission on the amount sold over $1000.  Since $2500 - $1000 = $1500 was sold over $1000, the additional commission is 10% of $1500, which is $150.  The total commission is $300 (on the first $1000) + $150 (on the remaining $1500).  The answer is $450. 
[EXP] 554: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 92, [output]: 1. 2 cases of water have 24 bottles each, so he started with 2 x 24 = 48 bottles. 2 bottles are needed for each of the 70 guests, so he needs 2 x 70 = 140 bottles. 140 - 48 = 92 bottles are needed.  The answer is 92. 
[EXP] 555: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 54, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

When the water is cold, Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes.  When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long.  To find how long it takes for Ray to swim a mile on a warm day, first find twice as long as 16 minutes:

2 x 16 = 32 minutes

Then, add 2 minutes:

32 + 2 = 34 minutes

To find out how much longer Ray takes to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day:

On a cold day, Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile.  For 3 miles, it would be:

3 x 16 = 48 minutes

On a hot day, Ray takes 34 minutes to swim a mile.  For 3 miles, it would be:

3 x 34 = 102 minutes

So, Ray takes 102 - 48 = 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.  The answer is 54. 
[EXP] 556: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

1. 2 dollars per hour, for 5 hours a day, is 2 * 5 = 10 dollars a day. 
2. 10 dollars a day for 4 days a week means he makes 10 * 4 = 40 dollars a week. 
3.  He wants to save 80 dollars, so we need to find out how many weeks it will take him to save that amount.  To do that, we'll divide 80 dollars (the amount he wants to save) by 40 dollars (the amount he makes in a week).  

80 ÷ 40 = 2 

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save 80 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 557: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  We know that the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs thrice as much as the foot-long fish sub.  The foot-long fish sub cost $40.   So, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub costs 3 x $40 = $120. 

In total, the cost for lunch today is $40 (for the foot-long fish sub) + $120 (for the six-inch cold-cut combo sub) = $160.  The answer is $160. 
[EXP] 558: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]: 21 buttons are in the bag. 7 buttons had 2 holes each, so that is 7 x 2 = 14 holes.  The rest of the buttons, which are 21 - 7 = 14 buttons, had 4 holes each. 14 x 4 = 56.  14 holes from the 7 buttons with 2 holes and 56 holes from the 14 buttons with 4 holes in total makes 14 + 56 = 70.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 559: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 24 is Timothy's locker size. 24 / 2 = 12 is Zack's locker size. 12 / 4 = 3 is Peter's locker size. 

The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 560: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how much coffee Octavia drinks.  She drinks half the daily recommended cups.  Let's call the daily recommended cups "x".  Octavia drinks x/2 cups.  Her husband Juan drinks 10 times as much coffee as she does, so he drinks 10*(x/2) = 5x cups. 

The doctor asks Juan to reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups.  How many cups does he have to reduce?  He currently drinks 5x cups and needs to reduce to 4 cups.  To find out by how many cups he must reduce, we subtract 4 from 5x.  5x - 4.  First, let's find out the value of x.   We know Octavia drinks x/2 cups, and we know this is half the daily recommended amount.   If Octavia drinks x/2 cups, then the daily recommended amount is 2*(x/2) = x cups.   Now we can plug x into our equation.   We know Juan needs to reduce his intake from 5x cups to 4 cups.   Substitute x for x/2*(2) = x.  5x - 4.   Just subtract 4 from 5x to see how many cups Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake.  5x - 4.  That's the answer. 
[EXP] 561: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that is 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters. 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that is 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs. 30 hamsters and 15 guinea pigs is a total of 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 562: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]: 1.  We know Mark weighs 150 pounds.  Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, so Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.   Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 130 x 2 = 260 pounds.  We have the weights of the three friends: 150, 130, and 260.  The average is the sum of these weights divided by 3: (150 + 130 + 260) / 3.  To add these numbers, we first need to add 150 and 130: 150 + 130 = 280.  Then we add 260 to that: 280 + 260 = 540.  Finally, we divide the sum by 3: 540 / 3 = 180.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 563: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

Initially, the angle from the ground to the sun is the same as the angle of the pyramid (32 degrees). 

The sun moves 5 degrees per hour, and it moves for 10 hours.  So, it will move a total of:

5 degrees/hour × 10 hours = 50 degrees

The sun will move 50 degrees straight upward, so the new angle from the ground to the sun will be:

32 degrees (initial angle) + 50 degrees (movement) = 82 degrees

The answer is 82 degrees. 
[EXP] 564: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  The 4-year-old is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.  James has 2 sons, so he needs 12 + 8 = 20 candles.  One pack of 5 candles costs 3 dollars, so he needs 4 packs (20/5 = 4). 4 packs for 3 dollars each will be 4 x 3 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 565: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 240, [output]:  In the first week, Judy read for 7 nights (since she read each night before going to sleep).  Each night, she read for 15 minutes.  So in the first week, she read for a total of 7 x 15 = 105 minutes.  If it takes her 1. 5 minutes to read 2 pages, then for each minute, she reads 2 / 1. 5 = 4 / 3 pages.   So in the first week, she read 105 x (4 / 3) = 140 pages. 

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.  In two weeks, she read 140 + 100 = 240 pages.  

The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 566: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 12 sandwiches originally.  Cody ate 1/3 of them, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 sandwiches.  Trevor ate 1/4 of them, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 sandwiches. 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches. 12 - 7 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 567: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Shiloh is 44 years old today.  In 7 years, he will be three times as old as his nephew.  First, let's figure out how old Shiloh will be in 7 years.   He will be 44 + 7 = 51 years old.   At that time, his nephew will be 51 / 3 = 17 years old.  Since that is 7 years in the future, his nephew is 17 - 7 = 10 years old now.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 568: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Sharon got $5 initially.  For the next three teeth, she got $1 dollar each, so she got 1 x 3 = 3 dollars more.  So, in total, Sharon has 5 + 3 = 8 dollars.  For each of the last two teeth, she got half the amount of the previous three teeth, which is 3/2.   Since she got that for 2 teeth, she got 3/2 x 2 = 3 more dollars.   So then, she has 8 + 3 = 11 dollars in total.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 569: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 175, [output]:  Richie scored 80 goals.  According to the question, he scored 20 more than Mark and 45 more than Anna.  So Mark must have scored 60 and Anna must have scored 35.  Then the total is 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.  The answer is 175. 
[EXP] 570: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Liam made $63.  Mitchell made 21 x 4 = 84.  Mitchell made $84 - $63 = $21 more.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 571: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Peter started with $70.  He will spend for a week, and the first 4 days (sunday to wednesday) he spent $5 each.  5 x 4 = 20.  After spending 20, he had 70 - 20 = 50 dollars left.  The rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures for $2 each.  There are 3 more days (thursday to saturday).  He has 50 dollars left, so he can buy 50 / 2 = 25 plastic action figures.  He already got 4 wooden action figures, so in total he will have 4 + 25 = 29 action figures.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 572: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 308, [output]:  Let's start by adding up the costs.  Spaying the kitten cost 200 dollars, so we add that to our total.  Then Leah's 3 vaccines each cost 20 dollars, so we multiply 20 by 3 to get 60.  60 + 200 is 260.  Then the kitten broke 4 vases that cost 12 each, so we multiply 12 by 4 to get 48.  260 + 48 is 308.  The answer is 308. 
[EXP] 573: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Ford grows 40 roses weekly.  There are 4 weeks in a month, so he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses in a month.  The total roses ordered by the shops every week are 20 + 15 + 30 = 65.  Therefore, Ford has to supply 65 roses every week.  For a month, it's 65 * 4 = 260 roses.  Ford grows 160 roses, so he lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 574: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 600, [output]:  Katina has 3000 dollars.  She removes 100 dollars every month, so in one year she removes 12 x 100 = 1200 dollars.  After one year she is left with 3000 - 1200 = 1800 dollars.  After the second year, she removes another 1200 dollars, so she will be left with 1800 - 1200 = 600 dollars.  The answer is 600. 
[EXP] 575: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. 1 loaf of bread costs $3. 00 and makes 10 sandwiches.  So the cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is 1 loaf * $3. 00 = $3. 00. 
2.  The truck spends $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.   This is a fixed cost.  
3.   For 10 sandwiches, the revenue is 10 sandwiches * $7.  00 per sandwich = $70.  00. 
4.   Total cost for the 10 sandwiches is the cost of bread ($3. 00) plus the cost of cheese and condiments ($30.   00).  This is $33.   00.  
5.    Net profit is revenue ($70. 00) minus total cost ($33.  00).   This is $70. 
[EXP] 576: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]: 64 crayons were originally. 3 boxes of 64 each is 3 * 64 = 192 crayons. 8 crayons are melted to make a muffin.  Since 192 crayons are melted into 192/8 = 24 muffins, Kate can sell 24 muffins for 24 x 1. 50 = 36 dollars.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 577: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11232, [output]: 1.  Find the total square footage of the bedroom:

18 ft.  * 12 ft.  = 216 sq.  ft. 

2.  Calculate the cost of the carpet:

216 sq.  ft.   * $12 / sq.  ft.  = $2592

3.   Calculate the cost of the padding:
The padding is $2 per square foot.    Multiply the total square footage by the cost per square foot:

216 sq.   ft.    * $2 / sq.   ft.  = $432

4.    Calculate the cost of removing the old carpet:
The contractor charges $4 per square foot.     Multiply the total square footage by the cost per square foot:

216 sq.   ft.    * $4 / sq.   ft.  = $864

5.     Calculate the cost of installing the new carpet:
The contractor charges $34 per square foot. 
[EXP] 578: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total number of birds Mack saw over the week:

Day 1 and 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds
Day 4 and 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total birds = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds

There are 7 days in a week.  To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

Average birds per day = Total birds / Number of days
= 280 birds / 7 days
= 40 birds/day

So, Mack saw an average of 40 birds per day.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 579: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

Starting value = 20

Half of the starting value = 20 / 2 = 10

Plus half the starting value: 20 + 10 = 30

Divided by 5: 30 / 5 = 6

The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12: 6 x (20 - 12) = 6 x 8 = 48

The final value of the number train is 48.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 580: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  There are originally 5 cards with the boy.  His brother has 3 fewer cards, so he has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.  In total, they have 5 + 2 = 7 cards.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 581: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 500, [output]:  The temperature is off by 468 - 450 = 18 degrees.  18 / 450 is 18 ÷ 450 = 0. 04, or 4%.  The original temperature was 520.  To find the adjusted temperature, multiply 520 by (1 + 0. 04).   520 × (1 + 0.  04) = 540.  The answer is 540. 
[EXP] 582: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 215, [output]: 2 movies.  The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. 1 hour = 60 minutes and there are 30 minutes left, so 60 + 30 = 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long. 2 hours = 120 minutes and there are 5 minutes left, so 120 + 5 = 125 minutes.  To find the total time taken to watch both movies, we add 90 minutes and 125 minutes. 90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
[EXP] 583: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 129200, [output]: 30% less means Juan's house is 70% of Herb's house. 70% of 76000 is (0. 7 * 76000) = 53200.  So Juan's house is 53200 dollars.  The value of the two houses combined is 76000 + 53200 = 129200.  The answer is 129200. 
[EXP] 584: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  There are two things to figure out here: how many dishes Judy brought and how many dishes her friend brought.  Since Judy brought twice as many dishes as cups, and 12 cups, that means she brought 2 x 12 = 24 dishes.  Her total items were cups and dishes.  12 + 24 is 36.  Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy.   So she brought 40 cups and 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.   Her total items were cups and dishes.  40 + 44 is 84.  The total number of utensils brought by the two is 36 + 84 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 585: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 1 box lasts Pete 45 days. 2 boxes will last Pete 2 * 45 = 90 days.  So he gets 90 single use contacts from 2 boxes. 1 box is 100 dollars, so 2 boxes are 100 * 2 = 200 dollars.  Since it's 10% off, we discount the price by 10% of 200, which is 10% * 200 = 20 dollars.  The discounted price is 200 - 20 = 180 dollars.  Now, the total price is the discounted price divided by the total number of contacts.  180 / 90 is 2.  The answer is $2. 
[EXP] 586: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday, so he earned 2 * 10 = 20 dollars.  She worked 1 hour on Sunday, so she earned 10 dollars.  So she earned 30 dollars in total.  John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, which is 4 hours.  So he earned 4 * 10 = 40 dollars.  He worked 3 times as long as Jill on Sunday, which is 3 hours.  So he earned 3 * 10 = 30 dollars.  In total, he earned 40 + 30 = 70 dollars.   John earned 70 dollars and Jill earned 30 dollars.  To find out how much more John earned, we can subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings.  70 - 30 is 40.  The answer is 40 dollars. 
[EXP] 587: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 800, [output]:  Hannah burns 500 calories per hour.  For 2 hours, that's 2 x 500 = 1000 calories.  Then she burns 600 calories per hour, which means 1 x 600 = 600 calories.  So in total she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.   Since she needs 100 ml of water per 200 calories, she will need 100 x (1600 / 200) = 100 x 8 = 800 ml of water.  The answer is 800. 
[EXP] 588: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let's say the number of blue jelly beans is x.  According to the note, the number of red jelly beans is 1% fewer than the number of blue jelly beans, which is x - (1% of x) = x - x/100 = 99/100x.  The number of green jelly beans is 1% more than the number of blue jelly beans, which is x + (1% of x) = x + x/100 = 101/100x.   Since the jar contains a total of 4500 jelly beans, we know:

x + (99/100x) + (101/100x) = 4500

Combine like terms:

x + 198/100x = 4500

Combine x with the 198/100x:

299/100x = 4500

Multiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the fraction:

299x = 450000

Divide both sides by 299:

x = 1500

We found the number of blue jelly beans to be 1500.   Now we can find the number of red jelly beans: 99/100 × 1500 = 1495.  Finally, we can find the number of green jelly beans: 101/100 × 1500 = 1515. 

The question asked how many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans.  So, subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans:

1515 - 1495 = 20

The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 589: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many words Jared's typing speed increased by between the first measurement and the second measurement.  His typing speed increased from 47 WPM to 52 WPM.   52 - 47 = 5.  So it increased by 5 WPM.  Next, his typing speed increases once more by 5 WPM.  So now his typing speed is 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.  To calculate the average of the three measurements, we add the measurements and divide by the number of measurements, which is 3 in this case.   The average would be (47 + 52 + 57) / 3.  This is (156) / 3 = 52.  So the answer is 52. 
[EXP] 590: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1. 25 pounds per week.  In 5 weeks, he would have lost 5 x 1. 25 = 6. 25 pounds.   If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.  75 pounds per week.   In 5 weeks, he would have gained 5 x 1.  75 = 8.  75 pounds.  The difference in his weight between the two breakfast options would be 8. 75 pounds.  (8. 75 - ( - 6.   25)) = 8.  75 + 6.  25 = 15 pounds.  So the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks would be +15 pounds.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 591: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 319, [output]:  Alex initially invited 100 people. 100 people will each invite 2 friends, so that is a total of 100 x 2 = 200 more people.  So the total number of people invited via email is 100 + 200 = 300.  By calling 10 of her friends, she invites 10 people. 8 of them say they will be bringing their spouses, so 8 x 1 = 8 more people.  This adds 10 + 8 = 18 people to the total.  The total number of people now is 300 + 18 = 318.  Alex needs seats for 318 people.  The answer is 318. 
[EXP] 592: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 220, [output]:  Let's start with the Affenpinscher, who weighs 10 pounds.  Next to him is the Dachshund, who weighs twice as much.  So the Dachshund weighs 2 x 10 = 20 pounds.  Next to the Dachshund is the Papillon, who weighs one-fourth as much.  So the Papillon weighs 20/4 = 5 pounds.  Finally, at the end of the line is the Mastiff, who weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon.  So the Mastiff weighs 5 x 44 = 220 pounds.  The answer is 220. 
[EXP] 593: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  On Amazon, the boots cost 16 dollars and shipping costs 4 dollars, so in total it cost 16 + 4 = 20 dollars.  On eBay, the boots cost 13 dollars, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon, so shipping costs 4 * 2 = 8 dollars.  So on eBay, the total cost is 13 + 8 = 21 dollars.  Since the boots cost 21 dollars on eBay and 20 dollars on Amazon, they will cost 21 - 20 = 1 dollar more.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 594: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, so the beanstalk must be taller than that.  The beanstalk starts at 4 feet and doubles its height each day.

[EXP] 595: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  One cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and has 3 grams of protein.  John eats 200 grams of mushrooms every day.  First, we find out how many cups of mushrooms he eats every day.   200 grams / 100 grams per cup = 2 cups.  Then, we multiply the number of cups by the amount of protein per cup to get the amount of protein John consumes per day. 2 cups times 3 grams per cup gives 6 grams of protein per day.  Finally, we multiply this by the number of days in a week to get the total amount of protein John gets per week. 6 grams per day times 7 days per week gives 42 grams of protein per week.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 596: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's solve this problem step by step. 

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.  This means that his current age is twice his age 5 years ago.  This can be written as x = 2(x - 5). 

This is an equation, and we can solve for x.   First, isolate x on one side:

x = 2x - 10
Add 10 to both sides:
x + 10 = 2x
Subtract x from both sides:
10 = x

Jerry is currently 10 years old.  To find out how old he will be in 3 years, add 3:

10 + 3 = 13

So Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 597: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 260, [output]:  To calculate the total cost of the dental work, we need to add the base cost of the implants and the extra cost of the crown. 

2 implants x $2000 per implant = $4000
Extra cost of the crown = $500
Total cost = $4000 + $500 = $4500

After deducting the deposit, George still needs to pay:
$4500 - $600 = $3900

Now, we need to calculate how many hours George needs to work to earn $3900, considering he makes $15 per hour. 3900 / 15 = 260

So, George needs to work for 260 hours to have enough money to pay for the dental work.  The answer is 260. 
[EXP] 598: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 3 angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's use a variable to represent the smallest angle, say "x".  One angle is twice the smallest angle, which is 2x.  One angle is three times the smallest angle, which is 3x.   So the 3 angles are x, 2x, and 3x.  The three angles add up to 180.  x + 2x + 3x = 180.   Simplify the left side by combining like terms:  6x = 180.  Divide both sides by 6 to get x = 30.  So the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  Now we can find the two other angles.  One is twice the smallest angle which is 2x = 2(30) = 60.  The other one is three times the smallest angle which is 3x = 3(30) = 90.  The largest angle is 90 degrees.   The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 599: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 69, [output]: 1 nickel is equal to 5 pennies, so let's first convert all the money amounts to pennies. 8 quarters is 8 x 25 = 200 pennies.  6 dimes is 6 x 10 = 60 pennies.  14 nickels is 14 x 5 = 70 pennies.  15 pennies is, well, 15 pennies! In total, that's 200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 pennies. 1 gumball costs 5 pennies, so we can divide 345 by 5. 

345 / 5 = 69

So, Colby can buy 69 gumballs. 69 gumballs!.  The answer is 69. 
[EXP] 600: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 5 dogs have 5 x 4 = 20 legs. 2 cats have 2 x 4 = 8 legs. 10 birds have 10 x 2 = 20 legs. 20 + 8 + 20 = 48.  Therefore, there are 48 legs in total.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 601: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Jamaal originally used an 8-pound weight.  He increases the weight by 50%.  50% of 8 is 4, so the new weight is 8 + 4 = 12.  This is too heavy, so he uses a weight that is 2 pounds less than this.  12 - 2 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 602: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 104, [output]:  Steve loves playing video games.  His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday.  He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the following year he starts buying 2 games a month.   For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money.   He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year. 

For the first year, he got 5 games for his birthday, and then 12 more games because he bought 1 game per month = 5 + 12 = 17 games. 

For the second year, he got 5 games for Christmas, and then 24 more games during the year because he bought 2 games per month = 5 + 24 = 29 games. 

For the third year, he got 5 games for Christmas, and then 48 more games during the year because he bought 4 games per month = 5 + 48 = 53 games.  And over 3 years, he got 17 + 29 + 53 = 99 games.  He already had 5 games to start with, so now he has 5 + 99 = 104 games.  The answer is 104. 
[EXP] 603: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 1200 miles in 3 hours means the rate is 1200 / 3 = 400 miles per hour.  To travel 2000 miles at this rate, it would take 2000 / 400 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5 hours. 
[EXP] 604: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1800, [output]:  Ruiz can make 120 pounds in 2 hours, so in 1 hour, she can make 120 ÷ 2 = 60 pounds. 
Marissa can make 3/4 as much as Ruiz, so she can make 60 x 3/4 = 45 pounds per hour. 
In 12 hours, Ruiz can make 12 x 60 = 720 pounds, and Marissa can make 12 x 45 = 540 pounds. 720 + 540 = 1260.  The answer is 1260. 
[EXP] 605: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Howard started with 100 dollars.  He spent 8 dollars on Monday.  Then he spent twice as much on Tuesday, which is 8 x 2 = 16 dollars.  Then he spent 4 times as much on Wednesday, which is 16 x 4 = 64.  In total, he spent 8 + 16 + 64 dollars.  8 + 16 + 64 is 88.   He has 100 - 88 dollars left.  100 - 88 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 606: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  For the first 4 hours, Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour at $0. 50 per cup.   So, he sold 15 * 4 = 60 cups for a total of 60 * $0. 50 = $30.   Then for the next 2 hours, he sold 10 cups per hour at $0. 60 per cup.    So, he sold 10 * 2 = 20 cups for a total of 20 * $0.  60 = $12.    In total, he sold lemonade for 6 hours, and earned $30 + $12 = $42.   The answer is $42. 
[EXP] 607: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Jeremy drives 400 miles per month. 725 times, that is 400 / 2 = 200 times per month.  Each tire will rotate 200 * 725 times = 145,000 times per month. 10,440,000 / 145,000 is 72.  72 months / 12 months per year is 6 years.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 608: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  First, let's find the total number of pumps in the bottle. 120 washings with 2 pumps per washing means there are 2 * 120 = 240 pumps.  The bottle costs $24, or 2400 cents.  To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the number of pumps: 2400 ÷ 240 = 10.  So each pump will cost 10 cents.  The answer is 10 cents. 
[EXP] 609: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Firstly, we calculate the price of the outfit before the discount. 25 + 35 = 60.  Since there is a 30% off sale, Joe gets a discount of 30% of 60.  To calculate 30% of 60, we find 30/100 * 60 = 18.  So Joe gets a discount of 18 dollars.   He will pay 60 - 18 = 42 dollars.  Since sales tax is included, this is the final price.  Joe starts with 50 dollars.  After buying the outfit, he will have 50 - 42 = 8 dollars left.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 610: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 1 dozen croissants takes 1/4 pound of butter. 4 dozen will take 4 * 1/4 = 1 pound of butter.

[EXP] 611: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 65,960, [output]:  Let's first calculate the cost to repave Monica's street.  The cost is $194 per meter, and the length is 150 meters.  So the cost for Monica's street is 150 x 194 = 29,100 dollars.  Now, let's do the same for Lewis' street.  The cost is also $194 per meter, and the length is 490 meters.   So the cost for Lewis' street is 490 x 194 = 95,140 dollars.  To find the cost difference between the two, we subtract the cost for Monica's street from the cost for Lewis' street.   95,140 - 29,100 = 66,040.  The answer is 66,040. 
[EXP] 612: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1,450,000, [output]:  John gets an initial funding of $100,000 for 5 months.  That means the first 5 months will be 5 * $100,000 = $500,000. 

After this, his research will take 10 times longer, or 10 * 5 months = 50 months.  The first 5 months got $100,000 each, so that's the first 5 months of the longer research period too.   For the 45 months left, every month gets 50% more than the initial $100,000, so each month gets $150,000.  So for 45 months with $150,000 each, that's 45 * $150,000 = $6,750,000. 

The total cost of the research is then $500,000 + $6,750,000 = $7,250,000.  The answer is $7,250,000. 
[EXP] 613: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 6 ounces were eaten by the first player.  The second player ate 8 beef tips, and each tip was an ounce, so the second player ate a total of 8 ounces.  The third player ate a one-pound steak, so the third player ate 16 ounces (1 pound = 16 ounces).   In total, those players ate 6 + 8 + 16 = 30 ounces of meat.  The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they ate no meat.  Therefore, the total number of ounces of meat consumed by the team is 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 614: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 93000, [output]: 1000 members in the Reddit group, each posting 3 posts per day means there are 1000 * 3 = 3000 posts per day. 31 days in March. 3000 posts per day * 31 days = 93,000 posts in March.  The answer is 93,000. 
[EXP] 615: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 312, [output]:  Gary does laundry twice a week.  This means he does laundry a total of 2 x 52 = 104 times in a year (since there are 52 weeks in a year). 

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.  Since he does laundry 104 times, he uses 104 x 20 = 2080 gallons of water in a year.  Each gallon of water costs $0. 15, so his total laundry water cost will be:

2080 gallons x $0. 15/gallon = $312.  The answer is $312. 
[EXP] 616: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 33, [output]:  Scarlett started with a budget for the aquarium which cost $10. 00.  Then she bought 2 bags of rocks for $2. 50 each, so that is 2 * 2. 50 = 5.  She also bought 3 pieces of coral at $2.  00 each, so that is 3 * 2.  00 = 6.   She then bought 20 fish at $0.  50 each, so that is 20 * 0.  50 = 10.   Finally, she bought fish food that cost $2.  00.  So she spent $10 + $5 + $6 + $10 + $2 = $33.  The answer is 33. 
[EXP] 617: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Jane planted a beanstalk that was originally 3 inches tall.  It doubled in height the next week.   That means it grew by a factor of 2, so it would now be 3 * 2 = 6 inches tall.   In the third week, it grew 4 inches more, so it is now 6 + 4 = 10 inches tall.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 618: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 750kg meat from the bull is needed to be sold. 15 kg are sold each hour, and Prince works 10 hours a day. 15 x 10 = 150 kg, so he can sell 150 kg a day.  To sell the 750 kg, he will need 750/150 days. 750 divided by 150 is 5.  The answer is 5 days. 
[EXP] 619: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  To solve this problem, let's start by calculating the total number of seats in the auditorium.  Since there are 4 rows and 18 seats in each row, the total number of seats is 4 * 18 = 72. 

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so 72 * (1/4) = 18 seats were occupied by the administrators. 

The number of remaining seats is 72 - 18 = 54. 

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so 54 * (1/3) = 18 seats were occupied by the parents. 

The number of seats left is 54 - 18 = 36.  These are occupied by the students.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 620: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 76, [output]: 4 street lights are on each pole. 6 poles are at each intersection. 4 x 6 = 24 street lights at each intersection. 4 intersections means 24 * 4 = 96 street lights. 20 street lights are not working. 96 - 20 = 76. 76 street lights are functioning.  The answer is 76. 
[EXP] 621: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1509, [output]: 2 DVDs are left.  The first DVD has been played 356 times.  It can still be played 1000 - 356 = 644 times.  The second DVD has been played 135 times.  It can still be played 1000 - 135 = 865 times.   Add them, 644 + 865 = 1509.  The answer is 1509. 
[EXP] 622: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3000, [output]:  John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks, 2 times each week.  So he went to 6 * 2 = 12 times.  Each session was 2 hours, so 12 * 2 = 24 hours.   Each hour costs 125 dollars. 24 * 125 = 3000.  The answer is 3000. 
[EXP] 623: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum. 

Jim chews 1 piece for every 2 hours at school, so during the school day of 8 hours, he chews 8 ÷ 2 = 4 pieces.  He also eats 1 piece on the way home from school and 1 piece after dinner.  So he eats a total of 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces. 

After eating, Jim has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left.  Then he gives half of the remaining gum to his sister before bed, so he gives 14 ÷ 2 = 7 pieces of gum.  This leaves him with 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 624: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Charmaine will be 16 in 12 years.  To find her age 4 years from now, subtract 4 from 12 to get 8 years.  She will be 16 - 8 = 8 years old 4 years from now.  But that's her age before her birthday, which will be in 8 years.  So on her upcoming birthday, she will turn 16, and 4 years after that, she will be 16 + 4 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 625: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 85, [output]:  The baseball coach spent 9 x 3 = 27 dollars.  The basketball coach spent 8 x 14 = 112 dollars.  The basketball coach spent 112 - 27 = 85 dollars more than the baseball coach.  The answer is 85. 
[EXP] 626: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]: 10 rows with 20 flowers in each row means there were originally 10 x 20 = 200 flowers. 4/5 of 200 is 4/5 x 200 = 160. 160 flowers have bloomed.  The answer is 160. 
[EXP] 627: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]: 1 Mb has 1000 kb.  Ashley's internet connection speed is 20 kb per second.  To find out how many kb she has per hour, we need to convert seconds to hours.  There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour.  So, 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in 1 hour. 20 kb per second * 3600 seconds per hour = 72,000 kb per hour.  So, in Mb, we divide 72,000 by 1,000 to get 72 Mb per hour.  The answer is 72 Mb per hour. 
[EXP] 628: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 54, [output]:  On the first three days, the tow truck pulled 10 cars each day, for a total of 10 * 3 = 30 cars.  On the remaining days, it pulled 6 cars each (since 10 - 4 = 6).  Since there were 4 remaining days, it rode 6 * 4 = 24 cars.  In total, it rode 30 + 24 = 54 cars.  The answer is 54. 
[EXP] 629: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Adam is currently 40 inches tall. 1 foot is 12 inches, so 4 feet is 4 x 12 = 48 inches. 48 inches - 40 inches is 8 inches.  Adam needs to grow 8 inches.  He grows 2 inches a year, so it will take Adam 8 / 2 = 4 years to grow tall enough.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 630: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 17500, [output]:  James sold 10 cars, each for $25,000.  So the total amount he sold is 10 x 25,000 = 250,000 dollars.  The company paid 30% of the price of the cars, or 30/100 * 250,000 = 75,000 dollars.   So, James' profit is 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000.   He got a 10% commission on the profit, or 10/100 * 175,000 = 17,500.   So, he made 17,500 dollars.  The answer is 17,500.

The rest, 25 - 15 = 10, are men who can stay upright.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 632: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4800, [output]:  Let's start by finding the price of the gold and silver jewels.  We know the diamond jewell is $2000, so the price of the gold jewell is 4/5 times the price of the diamond jewell.   4/5 of $2000 is $1600.  The price of the silver jewell is $400 less than the gold jewell.   $1600 - $400 is $1200.  For all three jewells, we have $2000 for the diamond, $1600 for the gold, and $1200 for the silver.  $2000 + $1600 + $1200 = $4800.  The answer is $4800. 
[EXP] 633: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Max started with snowflake stamps. 16 snowflake stamps. 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps means 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.  9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps means 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps.  In total, 16 + 19 + 10 = 45 stamps.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 634: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's first find the speed difference between Bob and Tom.  Bob is driving at 55 miles per hour and Tom is driving at 70 miles per hour.  So the difference in speed is 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.  The distance between them is 75 miles.  To find the time it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we need to divide the distance by the difference in speed.  75 / 15 = 5 hours.   The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 635: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Naomi caught 17 fish, so Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.  Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren, so he caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 636: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 14. 60 dollars for 10 classes is 60 / 10 = 6 dollars per class. 6 dollars per class is less than 10 dollars per class, so his parents will sign him up. 10 classes \* 10 dollars per class would be a total of 100 dollars, which is more than the sign-up cost of 60 dollars.  If 1 class costs more than 10 dollars, then 10 or more classes will too.  If he misses 1 class, then it will still cost 60 per class. 90 / 9 is 10.  So he can miss 0 classes.  If he misses 1, then it will cost more than 10 per class, and they will not sign him up again. 0 classes missed is the best way for this to be true.  So he cannot be signed up for the full 10 classes without disrupting his parents' offer.  He could sign up for 9 classes or less. 9 classes would cost 9 * 6 = 54.  54 + 6 is 60, which is the sign-up cost.  10 classes would cost 10 * 6 = 60.  This is the same cost as the sign-up.   In order to meet these restrictions, he should attend 9 classes or less.   He could miss 1 class, but no more than that because the class cost would be more than 10 if he misses 2 classes.  He could miss only 1 class and still be under the 10 per class restriction.  So, he can miss 1 class before his parents won't sign him up again.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 637: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1050, [output]: 50 customers are processed by Jewel daily.  Julie processes twice as fast, so Julie processes 50 x 2 = 100 customers daily.  Together, they process 50 + 100 = 150 customers daily.   There are 7 days in a week, so for the week, they will process 7 * 150 = 1050 customers.  The answer is 1050. 
[EXP] 638: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's start with Paisley.  She ran 4 miles. 

Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran, which is 5 x 4 = 20 miles.   He also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Lynn ran 3 miles less than Reggie.  Reggie ran 20 miles, so Lynn ran 20 - 3 = 17 miles.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 639: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 12, [output]: 1.  First, we need to find the cost of one apple. 4 apples cost $5. 2, so 1 apple costs $5 / 4 = $1. 3, then 5 apples will cost 5 x $1 = $5. 

2.  Next, we need to find the cost of 1 orange.  3 oranges cost $3.  3, so 1 orange costs $3 / 3 = $1.  1, then 5 oranges will cost 5 x $1 = $5.  2. 

3.   Now that we know the cost of 1 apple and 1 orange, we can find the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges.  It's $5 (for apples) + $5 (for oranges) = $10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 640: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 216, [output]:  We need to find the volume of the hole to know how many cubic feet of earth Bob needs to remove.  The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.  To find the volume, we multiply the length, width, and depth: 6 * 4 * 3 = 72.  This means Bob needs to remove 72 cubic feet of earth.   Since it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, it will take him 72 * 3 = 216 seconds to dig the hole.  The answer is 216. 
[EXP] 641: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 43,500, [output]: 1.  Let's break this problem into parts.  There is a base price of the truck, which is 30,000 dollars.  Then we need to calculate the cost of all the added features. 

    - The king cab upgrade is 7,500 dollars. 
    - Leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab, so they are 7,500 ÷ 3 = 2,500 dollars. 
    - Running boards cost 500 less than the leather seats, so they are 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 dollars.  The exterior light package is 1,500 dollars.  So the total cost of the added features is 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500 = 13,500 dollars.  The total cost of Bill's new truck is the base price plus the added features.   That is 30,000 + 13,500 = 43,500 dollars.  The answer is 43,500. 
[EXP] 642: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 262500, [output]:  Tim's original salary is 20000 dollars per month. 5% of 20000 is 1000.  So his new salary is 21000 dollars per month.  Furthermore, he gets a bonus of half a month's salary, which is 10000 dollars.  21000 x 12 = 252000 for the year, and adding the bonus gives 252000 + 10000 = 262000.  The answer is 262000. 
[EXP] 643: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 10,800, [output]:  James buys 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 x 750 = 7500.  The 10 dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of the suits, so the dress pants cost 10 * 750 / 5 = 1500.  For each of the 10 suits, he buys 3 dress shirts, so he buys 10 * 3 = 30 dress shirts.  The dress shirts cost $60 each, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * 60 = 1800.  The total cost is the sum of the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts, so the answer is 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800. 
[EXP] 644: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 840, [output]: 20 political and weather news articles are published per day. 10 business news articles are published per day.  So, there are 20 + 10 = 30 news articles published per day.  There are 28 days in February.  Since 30 articles are published per day, 30 * 28 = 840 articles were published in February.  The answer is 840. 
[EXP] 645: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

Steve is 60 years old, and his wife is 4 years older than him, so his wife's age is 60 + 4 = 64.  Steve's son is half as old as his mom, so his son's age is 64 / 2 = 32. 

Now, Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 646: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 8 portions of 2 kilograms each means that one bag has 8 x 2 = 16 kilograms. 3 bags in total would have 3 x 16 = 48 kilograms.  The answer is 48.

She biked at a rate of 12 miles per hour and biked for 4. 5 hours, so we calculate her total distance biked: 12 x 4. 5 = 54 miles.  Now, let's find out how many miles Stanley biked.  He biked at a rate of 10 miles per hour and biked for 2. 5 hours, so we calculate his total distance biked: 10 x 2.  5 = 25 miles.  Finally, we add up their total distance biked: 54 + 25 = 79.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 648: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Bill started by digging 4 feet per hour through soil.  To dig 24 feet of soil, it will take 24 / 4 = 6 hours.  Then, he has to dig through 8 feet of clay, which is half his rate.  Half of 4 is 2, so he digs 2 feet per hour through clay. 8 feet will take 8 / 2 = 4 hours.  In total, it will take 6 hours for the soil + 4 hours for the clay.  6 + 4 is 10.  The answer is 10 hours.

[EXP] 650: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 162000, [output]:  Fishio received 2000 likes initially after 1 week. 3 weeks later, she received 70 times more likes which is 70 x 2000 = 140000.  Now she has 2000 + 140000 = 142000 likes in total. 20000 more likes were received recently. 142000 + 20000 = 162000.  The answer is 162000. 
[EXP] 651: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 142, [output]:  Clara originally bought 20 pomegranates for $20 each, so the total cost is 20 * 20 = 400 dollars.  With the voucher, she got $2 off, so the new total is 400 - 2 = 398.  The next day, 20 pomegranates at $30 each is 20 * 30 = 600, and with a 10% discount, that's 600 - 10% of 600 = 600 - 60 = 540.  The difference between the final prices is 540 - 398 = 142.  The answer is 142. 
[EXP] 652: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  We know in the first month, Ariadne sold 400 dollars worth of red hats and half the total sales of green hats.  If we let G be the total sales of green hats, we can set up the equation 400 = 1/2G.  To solve for G, we can multiply both sides by 2: 800 = G.  This means the total sales of green hats in the first month was $800. 

The total sales in the first month is the sales of red hats plus the sales of green hats, so 400 + 800 = 1200.  In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  The total sales of the first month was 1200, so the sales in the second month was 3/4 * 1200 = 900.  The question asks for the total sales in TWO months.  The total sales in the first month was 1200 and the total sales in the second month was 900. 1200 + 900 = 2100.  The answer is 2100. 
[EXP] 653: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  He gets an hour free from 5-6 PM, so he only pays for 3 hours from 6-9 PM.  6 PM to 7 PM costs $15.  Each hour after that is twice as much, or $30.  So for the next 2 hours, he pays 30 + 30 = 60.   The total he pays is 15 + 60 = 75.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 654: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's analyze the situation: Sally's bank account started with $200.  After the week, it holds $420.  So the total amount that entered her account during the week is $420 - $200 = $220.  Since she has received no other money during this week, this $220 is equal to her total wage minus the withheld amount.  We know her weekly wage is $300.   So, $300 - withheld amount = $220.  Subtracting 220 from both sides, we get withheld amount = $80.  The answer is$80. 
[EXP] 655: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start by determining how many deviled egg halves Lori needs to make in total.  Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests, she needs:

16 guests x 3 deviled egg halves per guest = 48 deviled egg halves

Since Lori needs 1 whole egg to make 2 deviled egg halves, she needs:

48 deviled egg halves / 2 deviled egg halves per egg = 24 whole eggs

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, she will need:

24 eggs / 12 eggs per dozen = 2 dozens of eggs

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 656: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 15 is the total number of pages required. 1/3 of 15 is the same as 15 * 1/3 = 5. 5 pages are already written. 15 - 5 = 10 pages are left.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 657: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Mike has 200 pages to read in 30 days. 200 / 10 = 20 days to read 10 pages/day. 30 - 20 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 658: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 330000, [output]:  The plane cost 150000 dollars.  This is the initial cost.  The initial cost is independent of any monthly costs. 

The hanger costs 5000 dollars per month.   After 12 months, this will be 5000 * 12 = 60000 dollars. 

The fuel costs twice as much as the hanger.   That means the fuel costs 2 * 5000 = 10000 dollars per month.   After 12 months, this will be 10000 * 12 = 120000 dollars.  Adding this to the hanger cost, that is 60000 + 120000 = 180000.  

The total cost for 1 year is the initial cost of the plane, plus the total cost of the hanger and fuel.  That is 150000 + 180000 = 330000.  The answer is 330000. 
[EXP] 659: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 30 minutes were taken to cook rice. 30 + 20 = 50 minutes are taken to cook pork, since it took her 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.  Cooking time for beans is half of combined cooking time of pork and rice.  Combined cooking time is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of 80 is 40 minutes.  Cooking time for rice + beans + pork is 30 + 40 + 50 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 660: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 1/2 pound almonds costs 1/2 * 10 = 5 dollars. 1/3 pound walnuts costs 1/3 * 15 = 5 dollars.  So the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 5 + 5 = 10 dollars. 1/5 pound almonds costs 1/5 * 10 = 2 dollars. 1/3 pound walnuts still costs 1/3 * 15 = 5 dollars.  So the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts costs 2 + 5 = 7 dollars.  The difference between the two mixtures is 10 - 7 = 3 dollars.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 661: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Since we are given the total number of animal legs (70) and the total number of animal heads (20), we can use the fact that the number of legs of sheep and geese can be related to the number of heads. 

Geese have 2 legs, and sheep also have 4 legs.  Let's take x be the number of sheep, and y be the number of geese.  Then we can write the following equations:

4x + 2y = 70 (since 4 legs x times and 2 legs y times give the total number of legs)
x + y = 20 (since x and y represent the number of heads)

Now we can solve these equations.  By solving the second equation, we can write x = 20 - y.  Then substitute x into the first equation:

4(20-y) + 2y = 70

Expand the left side:

80 - 4y + 2y = 70

Combine the y terms:

80 - 2y = 70

Subtract 80 from both sides:

-2y = -10

Divide by -2:

y = 5

So the number of geese is 5.  Now we can find the number of sheep:

x = 20 - y
= 20 - 5
= 15

The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 662: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 44, [output]:  Roger needs to buy coffee for a week.  He uses 1 pound per day, so 7 pounds in total.  His normal brand is $5 per pound, and the more expensive brand is 20% more.  We can calculate that 20% of $5 is $1, so the more expensive brand costs $6 per pound.  We can calculate how much Roger spent on coffee by multiplying the number of pounds by the cost per pound for each brand:
	* If he bought the normal brand, the total would be 7 * $5 = $35.  We know this is not what he did, since he said the normal brand was sold out. 
	* If he bought the more expensive brand, the total would be 7 * $6 = $42.  This is what he actually did.  To add this to his total, we must also add $2 for the donut.  $42 + $2 = $44.  The answer is 44. 
[EXP] 663: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Gus spent 20 dollars in total.  He bought 2 bags of chips for 2 dollars each, which is 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.  A bucket of fried chicken for 8 dollars.  And a bottle of soda for 1 dollar.   4 + 8 + 1 = 13 dollars.  So the grocery bill was 13 dollars, and he had 20 - 13 = 7 dollars left.  The apple pie must have cost the remaining 7 dollars, because the bucket of chicken, the bag of chips, and the bottle of soda together already cost 13 dollars.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 664: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 193, [output]: 600 newspapers in total were delivered. 198 were delivered to District A.  209 were delivered to District C. 198 + 209 = 407. 600 - 407 = 193. 193 newspapers must have been delivered to District B.  The answer is 193. 
[EXP] 665: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  John's class meets for 4 times a week.  Each time is for 2 hours.  That means the total class time is 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week.   Since he is taking the class for 6 weeks, the total class time is 8 * 6 = 48 hours.  

For every 1. 5 hours, he learns one recipe.  So the number of recipes he learns is 48 / 1. 5 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 666: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 150 teachers total. 60% are history teachers, which means 60/100 * 150 = 90 are history teachers.  So the rest are math teachers, which is 150 - 90 = 60 math teachers.  Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. 60 math teachers sleep 6 hours a day, so they sleep 60 * 6 = 360 hours a day.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 667: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, so Kassidy has 3/4 x 120 = 90 dollars.  Rayna has 60 more than Kassidy, so Rayna has 90 + 60 = 150 dollars.  Together they have 120 + 90 + 150 = 360 dollars.  They are going to share this equally among them, so they each get 360 / 3 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 668: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 53, [output]:  Sarah's basketball game is 4 quarters, each 12 minutes long. 4 * 12 = 48 minutes.  This is the original length of the game.

[EXP] 669: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 20% of 50 employees are in management, which is 20/100 * 50 = 10 employees.  Out of this 10, 30% oversee the company, which is 30/100 * 10 = 3 employees.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 670: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 132, [output]:  For every muffin, Svetlana needed 5 tablespoons of flour.  So for 16 muffins, she needs 5 x 16 = 80 tablespoons of flour.  Similarly, she needs 3 x 16 = 48 tablespoons of sugar and 0. 25 x 16 = 4 tablespoons of salt.   To find the total number of tablespoons of dry ingredients, we add these quantities together: 80 + 48 + 4 = 132.  The answer is 132. 
[EXP] 671: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 3 pounds of candy, 5 pounds of candy, and 4 pounds of candy will be in total 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 pounds. 12 pounds will be shared equally between the 3 people.  12 / 3 = 4.  Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.  The answer is 4.

[EXP] 673: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start with the information given. 8 days were good, then 8 days were bad and 8 neutral days.  So that accounts for 24 days out of the 30 days.  
There are 6 days left.   Out of the remaining 6 days, the last 3 are known: 1 good day, 1 neutral day, and 1 good day.  
The remaining 3 days are unknown.  We know there were 12 good days in total.  We have already accounted for 8 good days.   12 - 8 = 4.   So there must be 4 good days left.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 674: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 21 books is Janey's total.  Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, so if x is the number of books Sally has, we can write an equation:

2x + 3 = 21

We can solve for x by subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 21 - 3
2x = 18

Then, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 18 / 2
x = 9

So, Sally has 9 books.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 675: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 1 foot = 12 inches. 20 feet = 20 * 12 = 240 inches.  The bamboo's height is 240 inches currently.  To get to 600 inches, it would need to grow 600 - 240 = 360 inches.  It grows 30 inches a day. 360 divided by 30 is 12.  The answer is 12 days. 
[EXP] 676: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 33, [output]: 1.  James has 4 toys and 4 dogs.  That means each dog has 1 toy.  So he's good for the 4 dogs.  2.  But there are 8 more dogs coming.  So he needs 8 more toys.   4 + 8 = 12.   So he needs 12 toys.   3.   Then he went back to the shelter and saw that there are twice as many dogs as he left.   There were 8 more dogs previously, so there are now 8 x 2 = 16 dogs in total.  So he need 16 - 8 = 8 more toys.  12 + 8 = 20 toys.  So he needs 20 toys now.  4.   Then 3 dogs were gone.  So he no longer needs 3 toys.  20 - 3 = 17.   So James needs 17 toys in total.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 677: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 240, [output]: 3 people originally invested 1200 dollars in total.  2/5 of 1200 is the amount Dylan invested, which is (2/5) * 1200 = 480.  Subtracting 480 from 1200 leaves 1200 - 480 = 720.  2/3 of that is 720 * (2/3) = 480.   Subracting 480 from 720 leaves Skyler's investment, which is 720 - 480 = 240.  The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 678: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Carol currently has 20 signatures.  Jennifer has 44 signatures.  So they have 20 + 44 = 64 signatures in total.

[EXP] 681: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]: 8 adults with average weight 80 kg each will weigh 8 x 80 = 640 kg. 700 kg is the maximum load of the elevator, so the elevator has 700 - 640 kg of extra capacity.  700 - 640 is 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 682: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 298, [output]:  First, let's start with the Cookie Monster.  Let's call the number of cookies the Cookie Monster has x.   Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, so Max has x + 12 cookies.   Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has (x + 12) + 23 cookies.   Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, so Katarina has (x + 12) - 5 cookies.   Since Katarina has 68 cookies, we can set up the equation:

(x + 12) - 5 = 68

Solve for x:

x + 12 - 5 = 68
x + 7 = 68
x = 61

The Cookie Monster has 61 cookies.  Max has 61 + 12 = 73 cookies.  Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.   Katarina has 68 cookies.   To find the total number of cookies, add these numbers up:

61 + 73 + 96 + 68 = 298

The answer is 298.

[EXP] 687: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Greta baked 30 cookies.  Celinda baked twice as many, so she baked 30 x 2 = 60 cookies. 30 + 60 = 90.  The pair ate 10 cookies, so they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies left.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 688: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the variables.  Let x be the age of the triplet.   The age of the other triplet is x.   One twin is 7 years older than one triplet, so one twin's age is x+7.  The other twin's age is x+7 as well, because there's a set of twins.    In total, their ages are 2*(x+7)+x = 3x+14.   So 3x+14 = 44.   If 3x+14 = 44, that means 3x = 30, and x = 10.  Therefore, the triplet's age is 10.  So one of the twins will be 10+7 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 689: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for history is a total of 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. 180 minutes - 80 minutes leaves 180 - 80 = 100 minutes. 100 minutes is the amount of time John has left for a nap.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 690: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Manolo paid $3. 20 for 5 lollipops and 4 candies.  So 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3. 20.  The 5 lollipops cost 5 * 0. 40 = $2. 00 and 4 candies cost 4 * ? (the price of a candy is not given, we would need more information to find this out), so together they cost $2.  00 + 4 * ?.   But this is not the price of 5 lollipops and 4 candies, but the price of 5 lollipops and 4 unknown-priced-candies, so it cannot be compared directly to $3.  20.  To find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies, we need more information.   We are given that 5 lollipops and 4 candies cost $3.   20.   We can find the cost of 1 lollipop and 1 candy.  Let s say a candy costs x.  Then 5 lollipops (5 * 0. 40 = $2.  00) and 4 candies (4 * x) will cost $3.  20.   So we can set up the equation 2.  00 + 4x = 3.   20.  We can solve for x (the cost of a candy):   2.   00 + 4x = 3.    20. 
[EXP] 691: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5760, [output]:  Rong has been saving 20 coins per month. 2/5 * 20 = 8, so Neil saves 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. 10 years is 10 * 12 = 120 months. 120 months.  In 120 months, Rong will have 120 * 20 = 2400 coins and Neil will have 120 * 28 = 3360 coins.  Combined, they will have 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.  The answer is 5760. 
[EXP] 692: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  John's dog needs 2 vaccines which are $20 each.  So the total cost for the vaccines is 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  The heartworm check is 60% of the total bill.  To find 60% of the total bill, we have to find 60/100 or 6/10 of the total bill.   The total bill so far is 40 dollars, so 6/10 of that is (6/10) * 40 = 24 dollars.  The heartworm check is 24 dollars.  So the total cost of all these services is 40 + 24 = 64 dollars.  John brought 125 dollars and spent 64 dollars.  He has 125 - 64 = 61 dollars left.  The answer is 61. 
[EXP] 693: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 1 banana costs twice as much as 0. 5 = 1, so 1 banana costs 1 dollar.  Oranges are three times as much as bananas, so 1 orange costs 3 dollars.  To find the cost of a crate, we first find the individual costs of each fruit in the crate: 5 bananas cost 5 * 1 = 5, 12 apples cost 12 * 0. 5 = 6, and 7 oranges cost 7 * 3 = 21.  The total cost is 5 + 6 + 21 = 32 dollars.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 694: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]: 14 red squares, 4 more blue squares than red, so 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  6 more green squares than blue, so 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  12 fewer white squares than green, so 24 - 12 = 12 white squares.  The total number of squares is the sum of the number of red, blue, green, and white squares: 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  Since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, the total area of the quilted comforter is 68 square feet.  The answer is 68.

[EXP] 696: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 50 percent of the deer are bucks.  50 percent of 50 is (50 x 50) / 100 = 25.  So there are 25 bucks.  Then 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points.  20 percent of 25 is (25 x 20) / 100 = 5.  So there are 5 8-point bucks.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 697: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 145, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many points Betty has.  Betty collects 30% more points than Adam, and Adam has 50 points.  To find 30% of 50, we can multiply 0. 30 * 50 = 15, so Betty collects 50 + 15 = 65 points. 

Let's now find out how many points Marty has.   Marty collects 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty.  So Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.   Since Marty collects 3 times more points than Tom, Marty has 3 x 35 = 105 points.  Adding it up, Adam has 50 points, Betty has 65, Marty has 105, and Tom has 35.  The total number of points is 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.  The class is 400 - 255 = 145 points short of the minimum threshold of 400 points.  The answer is 145. 
[EXP] 698: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Great Grandma Jones had 3 children.  Each of them had 3 children, making a total of 3 * 3 = 9 grandchildren.  Each of these grandchildren had 3 babies, making a total of 9 * 3 = 27 great-grand-babies.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 699: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 720, [output]:  Greta's paycheck is $2400. 50% of her pay is put into her retirement account.  To find 50% of 2400, we can use division: $2400 ÷ 2 = $1200.  So she puts $1200 into her retirement account.   She then uses 20% of her paycheck for her monthly car payment.  20% of $2400 is: $2400 ÷ 5 = $480.  Her car payment is $480.  After funding her retirement account and paying for her car, she has $2400 - $1200 - $480 left.   $2400 - $1200 - $480 is $720.   The answer is $720. 
[EXP] 700: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  There is space for 20 pencils in the box.  If there are 4 pencils missing, that means there are 20 - 4 = 16 pencils left.  A pair of pencils is 2 pencils.   To find the number of pairs, divide 16 by 2. 16 / 2 is 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 701: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 135, [output]: 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each is 15 x 20 = 300 fireworks in total.  40% of that is 40/100 x 300 = 120.  Hannah's backyard fireworks are an additional 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.  So 3 x 5 = 15.  Hannah sees 120 fireworks from the city display and 15 from her backyard.  120 + 15 = 135.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 702: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

There are Aiden and 12 friends, making a total of 13 people.  Then they meet 7 more friends, making a total of 13 + 7 = 20 people.  So there are 20 people going to the cinema.  Each seat needs two drinks and three snacks, making a total of 2 + 3 = 5 items per seat.   So the total number of items needed is 20 * 5 = 100.  The drinks and snacks cost 2 dollars each, so the total cost is 100 * 2 = 200 dollars.  The answer is 200. 
[EXP] 703: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2800, [output]: 4,000 pounds

Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck.  800 + 4,000 = 4,800.  The three trucks can haul a total of 11,600 pounds.  We set up the equation 4,000 + 4,800 + Gary's truck = 11,600.   We subtract 8,800 from both sides to get Gary's truck = 11,600 - 8,800.  11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800.  The answer is 2,800 pounds. 
[EXP] 704: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many dumplings each male ate.  If each female ate 3 dumplings, then each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings, since each male ate one more dumpling than each female. 

There are 8 males and 6 females, so a total of 8 + 6 = 14 people.  Since there were no leftovers, this means the total number of dumplings cooked by Larry must be equal to the total number of dumplings eaten by all 14 people. 

The females ate a total of 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings, and the males ate a total of 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.  The total number of dumplings eaten is 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings.  Therefore, Larry must have cooked 50 dumplings for his friends.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 705: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Gerald and Julia divided $100. 3:2 means that Gerald's share was 3/5 of 100 and Julia's share was 2/5 of 100.  3/5 of 100 is $60 and 2/5 of 100 is $40.  Gerald got $60.  After he spent $10 on a book, he had $60 - $10 = $50 left.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 706: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's start by finding the speed of the turtle.  The cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, and the cat can run 15 feet per second.  So the turtle can run 1/5 of the speed of the cat, which is 15/5 = 3 feet per second.  After 40 seconds, the turtle can crawl 3 * 40 = 120 feet.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 707: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 9, [output]:  The local firefighters started with $0 and have currently raised $2100.  They need $6300.   So they need $4200 more.   Since they have raised $2100 for 3 hours, they raised an average of $700 per hour.   To find the total number of hours needed to reach their goal, we can divide the remaining amount to be raised by the amount raised per hour.   So, $4200 ÷ $700 per hour = 6 hours.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 708: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 40% of the Colorado River's water is used by the city.  Of that 40%, 80% is used for industrial purposes.

[EXP] 709: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 7 days in a week, so 14 days in 2 weeks.  If she charges $12 per day, then the amount she charges for 14 days is 14 * 12 = 168.  The answer is 168. 
[EXP] 710: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3000, [output]:  Let's analyze this problem step by step.  First, we need to find the rate at which the factory makes chocolate and vanilla ice cream.  To find the rate, we divide the number of quarts made by the number of hours.   For chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.   So, the rate of making ice cream is 100/2 = 50 quarts per hour.   Similarly, for vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.  So, the rate of making vanilla ice cream is 50/4 = 12. 5 quarts per hour. 

Now that we know the rate, we can calculate the total quarts made in 48 hours.  For chocolate ice cream, 48 hours * 50 quarts per hour = 2400 quarts.   And for vanilla ice cream, 48 hours * 12. 5 quarts per hour = 576 quarts.  In total, the factory would make 2400 + 576 = 2976 quarts in 48 hours.  The answer is 2976. 
[EXP] 711: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Marcus bought:

* 3 mini quiches for $4. 00 apiece = 3 x 4 = 12 dollars
* 13 blueberry muffins at $1. 00 apiece = 13 x 1 = 13 dollars

Total before discount: 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50

Marcus gets 10% off.  To find 10% of 50, convert 10% to a decimal by dividing by 100: 10/100 = 0. 1.  0. 1 * 50 = 5. 

Marcus' total bill: 50 - 5 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 712: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 6 dollars.  Buying 2 scoops for 3 dollars would leave 6 - 3 = 3 dollars left.  With 3 dollars left, you could buy one more scoop.  So Erin should buy 3 scoops.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 713: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Ginger and Amy both have 100 pieces of Halloween candy. 2 weeks is 14 days.  Ginger will eat 4 * 14 = 56 pieces.  Amy will eat 3 * 14 = 42 pieces.  So Ginger will have 100 - 56 = 44 pieces.  Amy will have 100 - 42 = 58 pieces.  Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces of candy.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 714: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 576, [output]: 2/3 of 36 square feet is 36 * 2/3 = 24 square feet. 24 square feet requires 24 * 24 = 576 mosaic tiles.  The answer is 576. 
[EXP] 715: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Firstly, we calculate James's cost for picking blueberries.  The initial cost was $20.  Then he picked 30 pounds of blueberries at $1. 5 per pound.  So that's $30 * $1. 5 = $45.  Therefore, the total cost is $20 + $45 = $65.  (Note that I break the numbers down here to avoid confusion in adding numbers with different units). 

Next, we calculate the cost of buying the same quantity of blueberries at the store.   30 pounds * $2.  5 per pound = $75.  (Same breakdown as earlier to avoid confusion). 

To find the difference, we subtract the two costs: $75 - $65 = $10.   James saved $10 compared to buying the blueberries at the store.  The answer is $10. 
[EXP] 716: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 385000, [output]:  The company planned to buy 500 computers for $700 each, but the new price was 10% higher.  10% of 700 is 0. 1 x 700 = 70, so the new price is $770 each.  Since they bought 500 computers, they paid 500 x 770 = 385000.  The answer is 385000. 
[EXP] 717: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 770, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  We need to calculate the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham, and then add them together.  There are 6 eggs, each with 75 calories, so the eggs are 75 * 6 = 450 calories.  There are 2 oz of cheese, each with 120 calories, so the cheese is 120 * 2 = 240 calories.   We are told there is an equal amount of ham, which is 2 oz, and each ounce of ham has 40 calories.  So the ham is 40 * 2 = 80 calories.  We add up the calories: 450 (eggs) + 240 (cheese) + 80 (ham) = 770.  The answer is 770. 
[EXP] 718: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 6 pencils will cost 6 x $0. 50 = $3. 8 erasers will cost 8 x $0. 25 = $2.  So in total, the cost of 6 pencils and 8 erasers is $3 + $2 = $5.  You paid $10.  So you would get $10 - $5 = $5 in change.  The answer is $5. 
[EXP] 719: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 100 people apply for a job. 30% of 100 is 30, so 30 people get interviews.

[EXP] 721: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops this week.  So she bought 3 + 5 = 8 boxes this week.  Last week she bought 4 boxes.  The difference is 8 - 4 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 722: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2450, [output]: 1) Let's find the total number of taps when her arms are at her sides and not raised.  For the 3 minutes when her arms are at her sides, she taps her feet at a combined rate of 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.  So in those 3 minutes, she taps her feet 550 * 3 = 1650 times. 

2) Now let's find the total number of taps when her arms are raised.  For the 2 minutes when her arms are raised, she taps her feet at a combined rate of 200 + 200 = 400 taps per minute.  So in those 2 minutes, she taps her feet 400 * 2 = 800 times.  The total number of taps when her arms are raised is 800.  The total number of taps when her arms are not raised is 1650.  The total combined number of taps is 1650 + 800 = 2450.   The answer is 2450.

[EXP] 724: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  The restaurant started with 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs.  So there were a total of 170 + 23 = 193 chairs. 20 normal chairs were sent for repair, so there were 170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left. 13 baby chairs were sent for repair, so there were 23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left. 150 + 10 = 160 chairs were left.  The answer is 160. 
[EXP] 725: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]: 1.  First, we need to find out how many pizzas were ordered. 1 pizza for each of the 5 friends (Bryce and his 4 friends) is 5 pizzas.  
2. 2/3 of a pizza has 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices.   Bryce and 2 friends each ate 8 slices, so they ate 8 * 3 = 24 slices.  3.  The 2 remaining friends ate 3/4 of their pizzas, which is 3/4 x 12 = 9 slices.  Those 2 friends ate 9 * 2 = 18 slices.  4.   Total slices eaten = 24 + 18 = 42 slices.   
5.  Total slices ordered = 5 * 12 = 60 slices.  Total slices left = 60 - 42 = 18 slices.   The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 726: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Let's calculate the time it takes the dog to eat the same number of sausages:

Time taken by cat = 30 minutes
Time taken by dog = Time taken by cat * (2/3) = 30 * (2/3) = 20 minutes
Together, they take 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to eat the sausages.  The average time is 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.  The answer is 25 minutes. 
[EXP] 727: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  First, we need to convert the length of one of Topher’s shoes from feet and inches to just inches. 8 feet is 8 x 12 inches = 96 inches, and 4 inches is 4. 96 + 4 = 100.  The length of one of his shoes is 100 inches.    We are told it is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby’s shoes.  So if we let x be the length of one of Bobby’s shoes, we have this equation: 9x + 10 = 100.  To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation. 9x + 10 - 10 = 100 - 10, so 9x = 90.   Divide both sides by 9 and we get x = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 728: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 112, [output]: 64 students' cars with 4 windows each means there are 64 x 4 = 256 windows of students' cars.  A quarter of these are 256 / 4 = 64 windows.  For teachers' cars, there are 32 cars with 2 windows each, so 32 x 2 = 64 windows.  A 3/4 part of 64 windows is 64 / 4 * 3 = 48 windows.  Adding up the number of windows smashed from students' cars and teachers' cars, Hannah smashed 64 + 48 = 112 windows.  The answer is 112.

There are 40% blue spools of thread.  The answer is 40%. 
[EXP] 730: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1000, [output]: 5000 people were initially present. 2/5 of them had voted by midday. 2/5 of 5000 is (5000 * 2) / 5 = 2000.  So 2000 people had voted by midday, and 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were still present.  By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted, which means 2/3 of 3000 had voted, which is (3000 * 2) / 3 = 2000. 2000 more people voted, so the total number of people who had voted by 16:00 is 2000 (who had voted by midday) + 2000 = 4000.  So 5000 - 4000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.  The answer is 1000. 
[EXP] 731: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.  Parker wants to know how many packs he will need to last for 30 days.  To find the packs needed, we need to know how many pieces of gum Parker will need for 30 days.  Parker chews 4 pieces of gum per day, so for 30 days, he will need 30 x 4 = 120 pieces of gum.   A pack of gum has 15 pieces of gum, so the number of packs needed can be found by doing 120/15, which is 8 packs.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 732: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 8 smores per sleeve, 3 sleeves per box.  That means there are 8 x 3 = 24 smores per box. 9 kids want 2 smores each, so that is 9 x 2 = 18 smores. 6 adults want 1 smore each, so that is 6 smores.  18 + 6 = 24 smores.  Since there are only 24 smores per box, they will need 1 box, because 24 is equal to 24.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 733: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 87, [output]:  Dora is 15 years old.  Her father's age is 8 more than twice Dora's age.   So her father's age is 8 + (2 * 15) = 8 + 30 = 38.  Her mother is 4 years younger than her father, so her mother is 38 - 4 = 34 years old.   The combined age of Dora and her parents is 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.  The answer is 87.

Mark spent a total of 3 * 1800 = 5400 dollars.  Then he got the two magic cards worth 4000 and 1000, so in total he got 4000 + 1000 = 5000 dollars from these two cards.   In addition, he got 30 cards worth an average of 50 dollars each, so that is another 30 * 50 = 1500 dollars.  So he got 5000 + 1500 = 6500 dollars total.  His profit is 6500 - 5400 = 1100.  The answer is 1100. 
[EXP] 747: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  First, we need to calculate the total cost at the first amusement park. 2 adults at $26 each is 2 x 26 = 52. 2 children at $12 each is 2 x 12 = 24. 52 + 24 = 76. 

Next, we need to calculate the total cost at the second amusement park. 2 adults at $14 each is 2 x 14 = 28. 2 children at $10 each is 2 x 10 = 20.  28 + 20 = 48. 

The first amusement park costs 76 and the second amusement park costs 48. 76 - 48 = 28.  The family will save 28 dollars if they choose the second amusement park.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 748: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 350, [output]:  The tomato vendor used to buy 500 tomatoes for $0. 5 each. 500 x $0. 5 = $250 per day.  He gets a new vendor who sells the tomatoes for $0. 4 each.  500 x $0.  4 = $200 per day.   To find out how much he saves a day, subtract the new amount from the old amount: $250 - $200 = $50 per day.  To find out how much he saves a week, multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week: $50 * 7 = $350.  The answer is $350. 
[EXP] 749: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 336, [output]:  Ladenprecedent: Elements We can use Sean's marbles as the simplest unit for counting.  If Sean had 56 marbles, then Cal has 2 * 56 = 112 marbles, and Carl has 4 * 56 = 224 marbles.  Carl and Cal have 112 + 224 = 336.  The answer is 336. 
[EXP] 750: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3, [output]: 54 students are to be separated into 6 groups.  To find the number of students in each group, we can divide 54 by 6:

54 ÷ 6 = 9

This means each group will have 9 students.  However, the activity requires 12 groups, not 6.  To find out how many more groups are needed, we can subtract 6 from 12:

12 - 6 = 6

So, 6 more groups are needed to form.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 751: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4000, [output]: 60 chairs are rented each day from Monday to Friday, for a total of 5 * 60 = 300 chairs per week.  100 chairs are rented each day on Saturday and Sunday, for a total of 2 * 100 = 200 chairs per weekend.  So in total, 300 + 200 = 500 chairs are rented per week.  In a month, there are 4 weeks, so Candy rents out 500 * 4 = 2000 chairs.  In 2 months, she will rent out 2 * 2000 = 4000 chairs.  The answer is 4000. 
[EXP] 752: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 43, [output]:  Gunther started with 48 bananas.  When Arnold stole half of the bananas, he stole 48 ÷ 2 = 24 bananas.  So Gunther had 48 - 24 = 24 bananas left.  After adding 25 bananas, he had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.  But Arnold stole 12 more, leaving Gunther with 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.  Then Gunther added 6 more bananas, making a total of 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.  The answer is 43. 
[EXP] 753: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 240, [output]: 12 months x $100 = $1200 for electricity per year.  4 roommates share the bill, so they each pay $1200 / 4 = $300 per year.  For each month, they will pay $300 / 12 = $25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 754: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 128, [output]: 1 dozen is 12, so 8 dozen glasses means 8 x 12 = 96 glasses. 4 dozen plates means 4 x 12 = 48 plates.  After 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken, he has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses and 48 - 6 = 42 plates.  The answer is 86 glasses and 42 plates. 
[EXP] 755: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 89, [output]:  Amidst the Disney-Marvel takeover, we have a Math marathon going on!

Let's break it down step by step:

1.  Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers. 

She trades 90% of them for large buttons, which means she trades 27 small stickers (30 x 0. 9).  In return, she gets 27/3 = 9 large buttons, since each large button is worth 3 small stickers. 

Now she is left with 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers. 

2.  Lorraine starts with 40 large stickers.  

She trades 50% of them for large buttons, which means she trades 20 large stickers (40 x 0.  5).   In return, she gets 20 large buttons.  

She trades the remaining 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers for small buttons, which means she gets 60 small stickers (20 x 3).  Remember, each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons!

3.  Now Lorraine has 3 small stickers and 20 large buttons.   

She gets 9 large buttons for the remaining small stickers (3 small stickers x 3 = 9).  

In total, she now has:
   9 large buttons (from small stickers) + 20 large buttons (directly traded) = 29 large buttons

And,
   60 small buttons (from large stickers) + 9 small buttons (from remaining small stickers) = 69 small buttons

So, Lorraine has a total of:
   29 large buttons + 69 small buttons = 98 buttons.  The answer is 98. 
[EXP] 756: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Joey played 2 matches on Monday. 1 match was played on Friday.  Then on Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday, which means 2 x 2 = 4 matches.  In total, he played 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 matches in a week.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 757: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  This problem is a bit more complex, so let's break it down step by step.  Since there are 33 people on the council, the number of votes against the new regulation can be any number less than or equal to 33.  Let's call that number x.  Then, the number of votes in favor of the regulation will be 2x, since it says that there are twice as many votes in favor as there are against.  The number of votes in favor plus the number of votes against must equal the total number of council members, which is 33.  So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = 33.  We can combine like terms on the left side: 3x = 33.  To get x by itself, we can divide both sides by 3: x = 11.  Now that we know the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, we can find the number of votes in favor by multiplying by 2: 2x = 2 * 11 = 22.  So, 22 is the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 758: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Let's break this problem into smaller parts. 

11 students need size extra-small. 

Twice as many students need size small as extra-small, so 11 x 2 = 22 students need size small. 

Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium. 

Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large. 

Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large. 11 students need extra-small, 22 students need small, 18 students need medium, 9 students need large, and 15 students need extra-large. 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 759: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 133, [output]: 5% off of 140 is (5/100) * 140 = 7.  So 140 - 7 = 133.  The answer is 133.

[EXP] 761: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. 20% of 50 is 10 people.  Then 50 - 10 = 40 people are left.  60% of the remaining people think horse #7 will win. 60% of 40 is 24 people.  40 - 24 = 16 people left.  These 16 people think horse #12 will win.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 762: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Since two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, and one third of the Pomeranians are girls, we know that the total number of Pomeranian girls is one third of two thirds of the total puppies.  We are told this is 6, so we can set up an equation:  (1/3)(2/3)P = 6.  To find the total number of puppies, we multiply both sides by 3/2 to get P = 9.  So Jana has 9 puppies.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 763: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 85, [output]:  Jayden started with $70.  His sister Ava gave him half of her $90, so Jayden got $45.  So he now has 70 + 45 = 115.  The camera costs $200.   To find out how much more he needs, we subtract 115 from 200:  200 - 115 = 85.  The answer is 85. 
[EXP] 764: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Let's assign variables to represent the number of shingle cases for each house.  Let x be the number of shingles for the first house, y be the number of shingles for the second house, and z be the number of shingles for the third house. 

We know that the first house needs 1/2 of the second, so y = 2x.  We are also given that the total number of shingle cases is 250, so we can add the number of shingles for each house and set it equal to 250:
x + y + z = 250

We can substitute y = 2x into the equation:
x + 2x + z = 250
This simplifies to:
3x + z = 250

Now, we know that the third house needs double the first, so z = 2x.  We can substitute this into the equation:
3x + 2x = 250
This simplifies to:
5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
x = 50

Now that we know the number of shingles for the first house, we can calculate the number of shingles for the third house:
z = 2x = 2(50) = 100

So, the third house will need 100 cases of shingles.  The answer is 100.

The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 775: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  First, we calculate the distance of Jack's trip there and back.   150 miles each way is a total of 150 + 150 = 300 miles.   He drives at a speed of 75 mph.  To calculate the time it takes him to drive there, we do 150 / 75 = 2 hours.  To get back, it will be the same amount of time, so a total of 4 hours to drive there and back.  He spends 6 hours at the museum.   In total, he is gone from home for 4 (driving) + 6 (at the museum) = 10 hours.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 776: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 276, [output]: 57 cars need 4 wheels each, so 4 * 57 = 228 wheels will be used. 73 motorcycles need 2 wheels each, so 2 * 73 = 146 wheels will be used. 228 + 146 = 374 wheels will be used in total. 650 - 374 = 276. 276 wheels will be left.  The answer is 276. 
[EXP] 777: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 800, [output]: 20% of 1000 = . 20/100 * 1000 = 200. 1000 - 200 = 800.  The answer is 800. 
[EXP] 778: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]: 600 movies in total. 1/3 of them are in a series.  That's 600 / 3 = 200 movies in a series.  So that's 600 - 200 = 400 normal movies left.  

40% of the remaining 400 are older movies.  40% is 40/100 or 2/5.  So the older movies are 400 x (2/5) = 160.  The rest, 400 - 160 = 240, are normal movies. 

The series is 200 movies for 6 dollars each.  200 x 6 = 1200. 

The older movies are 160 movies for 5 dollars each.  160 x 5 = 800. 

The remaining 240 normal movies are at 10 dollars each.  240 x 10 = 2400.  So the total cost is 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400.  The answer is 4400. 
[EXP] 779: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches for $2. 6 * 2 = 12. 8 pounds of plums for $1. 8 * 1 = 8. 6 pounds of apricots for $3. 6 * 3 = 18. 12 + 8 + 18 = 38.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 780: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 255, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

They drove for some amount of time at 50 mph.  The amount of time is not given, but the total time is given as 6 hours.  Let's assume the driving time is "d" hours.  Then, the hiking time is 6 - d hours.  The total distance driven is the speed times the time, or 50 * d.  The total distance hiked is the speed times the time, or (50 / 2 - 5) * (6 - d).  Combining these into a single equation, we have:

50 * d + (50 / 2 - 5) * (6 - d) = 6 * 50

This can be simplified to:

50 * d + 25 * (6 - d) = 300

Simplifying further, we get:

50 * d + 150 - 25 * d = 300

Combine like terms:

25 * d = 150

Divide by 25:

d = 6

So they drove for 6 hours.  The distance driven is 6 * 50 = 300 miles.  The distance hiked is (50 / 2 - 5) * (6 - 6) = 0 miles, since they didn't hike at all (they did it in one and a half hours already). 

So, their vacation spot is 300 miles away.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 781: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]: 1.  First, let's find out how many points Ava and Emma will get from jumping on enemies.  If Ava jumps on 8 more enemies, that means Emma jumped on x enemies and Ava jumped on x + 8 enemies.  Then, Ava will get (x + 8) * 10 = 10x + 80 points and Emma will get x * 10 = 10x points. 

2.   Next, let's find out how many points they will get from collecting berries.   Emma will collect x berries and Ava will collect x + 3 berries.  Then, Ava will get (x + 3) * 5 = 5x + 15 points and Emma will get x * 5 = 5x points.  Now, we can add these two points together to get the total points for jumping on enemies and collecting berries: 10x + 80 + 5x + 15 = 15x + 95. 

3.   Finally, let's find out how many points they will get from the timer.   Emma will have y seconds left when she finishes the level and Ava will have y - 4 seconds left.   Then, Ava will get 30(y - 4) points and Emma will get 30y points. 

4.  To find the difference between their two scores, we can first find their total scores.   Ava will get (15x + 95) + 30(y - 4) points and Emma will get (15x + 95) + 30y points.   So, their difference in scores is:

(15x + 95) + 30(y - 4) - ((15x + 95) + 30y)

This simplifies to 30(-4) = -120.  The answer is -120.

The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 784: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's start by identifying what we know.  There were initially 7 fish in Bob's pond, with 3 being orange and 4 being white.  Then, he bought some fish and added them to the pond.   After adding the fish, there are now twice as many orange fish as white fish.   This means that the number of white fish must be one-half the number of orange fish.  Let's represent the number of white fish he bought as W.   And let's represent the number of orange fish he bought as O.  Since there were initially 3 orange fish, then the number of orange fish after adding to the pond will be 3 + O.   The number of white fish after adding to the pond will be 4 + W.  Since there are now twice as many orange fish as white fish, we know that 3 + O = 2 * (4 + W).    Simplifying this equation, we get:   3 + O = 8 + 2W  We want to know how many white fish he bought, so we need to get W by itself.   Let's subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:   O = 8 + 2W - 3  Simplify: O = 5 + 2W  Now we know the number of orange fish he bought.  But we want the number of white fish.   Remember that W is the number of white fish he bought, and we let O be the number of orange fish he bought.  Since he bought a total of 17 fish, we can set up the following equation: O + W = 17  We know the number of orange fish he bought: O = 5 + 2W.  Substitute this into the equation above: (5 + 2W) + W = 17  Simplify: 5 + 3W = 17  Subtract 5 from both sides: 3W = 12  Divide both sides by 3: W = 4  So the number of white fish he bought is 4.  The answer is 4.

[EXP] 790: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Carson started with a temperature of 45 degrees during the day.  At night, it is 33 degrees colder, so the temperature will be 45 - 33 = 12 degrees.  For the pipes not to freeze, Carson needs the temperature to be at least 32 degrees.  So he needs to increase the temperature by 32 - 12 = 20 degrees.  Since each log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, Carson needs to burn 20 / 5 = 4 logs of wood.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 791: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 108, [output]: 90 people were needed to split into groups.  9-person groups were formed.  To find out the number of groups, we divide the total people by the number of people in each group.  90 / 9 = 10.  So there are 10 groups.  3/5 of 10 is 6 groups.  If each group brings back 2 seashells each, then the total number of seashells brought back is 2 * 6 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 792: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 172 people were on the train. 47 people got off, so there are 172 - 47 = 125 people left. 13 more got on, so there are 125 + 13 = 138 people. 38 people got off, so there are 138 - 38 = 100 people left.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 793: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Damien gets 10 bottle caps a day. 10 x 30 days = 300 bottle caps. 300 bottle caps * . 25 each = 75 dollars.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 794: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  Jamie earned $20 per hour for 8 hours.  20 * 8 = 160.  This is her regular work.  Then she worked 11 - 8 = 3 more hours at a special rate that is 150% of $20.  150% of $20 is $30.  3 * $30 = $90.  So the additional 3 hours made $90.   Total she earned 160 + 90 = 250. 


The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 795: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 12 female lions are counted.  Half as many male lions, so 12 / 2 = 6 male lions.  The total number of lions is 12 + 6 + 14 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 796: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 25% off means you get a discount that is 1/4 of the original price. 1/4 of 40 is 10, so Mike gets a discount of 10 dollars. 40 - 10 = 30, so the price of the jeans is now 30 dollars. 50 - 30 is 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 797: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2880000, [output]:  The company started with 200 employees.  Each month, 20 new employees are hired.  So the number of employees increases by 20 each month.  For the first month, the number of employees will be 200 + 20 = 220.   For the second month, the number of employees will be 220 + 20 = 240.   For the third month, the number of employees will be 240 + 20 = 260.   To find the total amount of money paid to the employees, we calculate the total salary cost for each month and add those up:

* After the first month, there are 220 employees, and each earns $4000, so total salary cost is 220 x 4000 = $880,000.  So the total salary cost after 1 month is $880,000. 
* After the second month, there are 240 employees, and each earns $4000, so total salary cost is 240 x 4000 = $960,000.  So the total salary cost after 2 months is 880,000 + 960,000 = $1,840,000.  The total salary cost after 2 months is $1,840,000.  
* After the third month, there are 260 employees, and each earns $4000, so total salary cost is 260 x 4000 = $1,040,000.  So the total salary cost after 3 months is 1,840,000 + 1,040,000 = $2,880,000.   
The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $2,880,000.  The answer is $2,880,000. 
[EXP] 798: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 540, [output]:  The choir is singing "Deck the Halls" twice.  Since it is 150 seconds long, that is 150 * 2 = 300 seconds.  They also sing "Jingle Bells" once, which is 240 seconds long.  To find the total, add 300 + 240 = 540 seconds.  The answer is 540. 
[EXP] 799: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy's hourly rate at first was 10 dollars. 2 months later, he got a raise of 0. 50 per hour.  His hourly wage increased to 10. 50.  Then, 1 year later, he got another raise of 1.  00 per hour.   His hourly wage increased to 11.  50.  

Sally starts at 0.  50 more per hour than Billy's starting rate, so she begins at 10.  50 plus 0.   50.   That is 11.   So Sally works at 11.   00 per hour. 

Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.  Billy earns 11.  50 * 20 = 230.  Sally earns 11.  00 * 20 = 220.  If we subtract Sally's earnings from Billy's, we have 230 - 220 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 800: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 1 loaf of bread costs 2 dollars.  3 loaves will be 3 x 2 = 6 dollars. 1 bagel costs 1 dollar. 2 bagels will be 2 x 1 = 2 dollars. 6 - 2 is 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 801: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 428, [output]:  Pierson scored 278 points.  To find Nikita's points, we need to find half of 278.  278 / 2 = 139.  Since Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson, Nikita scored 139 + 11 = 150 points.  In total, they scored 278 + 150 = 428 points.  The answer is 428. 
[EXP] 802: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1240, [output]:  Each child plants a tree.  There are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students.  So we have 40 x 25 = 1000 students in total.  Each student plants a tree.  Each teacher plants 2 trees.  There are 3 teachers per class, and 40 classes.  So there are 3 x 40 = 120 teachers in total.  So the teachers plant 2 x 120 = 240 trees.  The students will plant 1000 trees.  In total, the school will plant 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.  The answer is 1240. 
[EXP] 803: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's calculate the total number of stuffed animals Bubbles has: 3 stuffed puppies + 5 stuffed koalas + 2 stuffed zebras + 4 stuffed frogs = 14.  So, 30% of her stuffed animals are goats:

(30/100) * 14 = (0. 3 * 14) = 4. 2 (_rounded to the nearest whole number, since you can't buy a fraction of a stuffed animal!)

Bubbles should buy 4 stuffed goats.  Note that this will make up 30% of her total stuffed animals.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 804: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 9, [output]: 1 day * 30 days / 2 weeks = 15 hours per week for half an hour a day. 2 hours a day for a week is 7 hours.  So, in total, Kris has played 15 * 2 + 7 = 37 hours.  To earn the achievement she still needs to play 30 - 37 = 3 hours.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 805: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  First, find the distance the first car will travel in 2 hours, since it maintains a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.  The distance it will travel is 60 x 2 = 120 miles.   The second car also maintains a constant speed of 70 miles per hour, so the distance it travels in 2 hours is 70 x 2 = 140 miles.   To find the distance between them after 2 hours, subtract the distance traveled by the first car from the distance traveled by the second car: 140 - 120 = 20.  After 2 hours, the two cars will be 20 miles apart.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 806: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]:  James spends $600 on the diamond and $300 on the gold, for a total of $600 + $300 = $900 on the materials.  He pays a 30% premium, which is 30% * $900 = $270.  So he pays a total of $900 + $270 = $1170.  The answer is $1170. 
[EXP] 807: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]: 340 out of 500 third-graders passed.  That is 340/500 = 68%. 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed.   That is 40/100 = 40%.  The 400 fifth graders had a pass rate that was twice 40%.  40 * 2 = 80%, so 80% of 400 is 80% * 400 = 320.  The total number of students is 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.  The number of students who passed is 340 + 40 + 320 = 700.  The school's overall pass rate is 700/1000 = 70%.  The answer is 70%. 
[EXP] 808: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 12 glass chips make one square inch.  Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall.  So it will take 12 * 3 = 36 glass chips to fill the height.  Each bag of glass chips has 72 chips.  Milo has 2 bags, so he has 2 * 72 = 144 chips.  He already needs 36 chips for the height. 144 - 36 is 108 chips left.  108 chips / 12 chips per inch is 9 inches.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 809: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 4 students each drank 1. 5 quarts of tea, for a total of 4 * 1. 5 = 6 quarts. 16 students each drank 2 quarts of tea, for a total of 16 * 2 = 32 quarts.  In total, 6 + 32 = 38 quarts were drunk.  There were 10 quarts of tea left.  So, the initial amount of tea must have been 38 + 10 = 48 quarts.  Since we're looking for gallons, we divide 48 quarts by 4 (since there are 4 quarts in a gallon). 48 ÷ 4 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 810: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Dale started with 100 candies.  He sold 150 candies.  That left him with 100 - 150 = -50 candies.  He then ordered 100 more candies.  So he now has -50 + 100 = 50 candies.  Since he wants to sell all of them, he needs to sell 50 more candies to make it a total of 0.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 811: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 310, [output]:  Since the number of students doubles every month, let's break down the ending number of students each month:

January: 10 students
February: 20 students (10 x 2)
March: 40 students (20 x 2)
April: 80 students (40 x 2)
May: 160 students (80 x 2)

Since we want to find out how many additional students joined beyond the original 10, we subtract the original number from the final number:

160 (may) - 10 (initial) = 150

So, there would have been 150 additional students on campus at the end of May, beyond the initial 10 students.  The answer is 150. 
[EXP] 812: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Let's start by finding the total number of branches Felix climbed throughout the week. 105 dollars / . 25 dollars per branch = 420 branches throughout the week. 

Since there are 7 days in a week, to average the number of branches climbed per day, we need to divide the total number of branches by 7. 420 / 7 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 813: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  Rose started with 3 flowers with 5 petals each. 3 x 5 = 15.  Then she picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  4 x 6 = 24.   Then she picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  5 x 4 = 20.   Lastly, she picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  6 x 7 = 42.  If she drops one of each and the wind blows them away, then she loses 1 5-petal flower, 1 6-petal flower, 1 4-petal flower, and 1 7-petal flower.   So she loses 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.   Originally, she picked 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.   After losing 22, she has 101 - 22 = 79 petals remaining.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 814: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  There were originally 35 marshmallows.  Each S'more uses 1 marshmallow.  John makes 9 S'mores, and DeSean makes 9 S'mores.  So they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.  Then they dropped 3, so in total they used 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.  35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left.  Since they want to divide them equally, they will each have 14 / 2 = 7 S'mores.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 815: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]: 4 hours is 4 x 60 minutes = 240 minutes.  Jack can play for 20 minutes with each quarter.  Two of his friends can play for half as long, so they can play for 10 minutes each with one quarter.  The third friend can play 1. 5 times as long, so they can play for 30 minutes with one quarter.  We can calculate the number of quarters they together consume in 240 minutes:
   - 240 / 20 = 12 quarters for Jack. 
   - 240 / 10 = 24 quarters for the two friends who can play for 10 minutes. 
   - 240 / 30 = 8 quarters for the friend who can play for 30 minutes.  In total they use 12 + 24 + 8 = 44 quarters, or 44 / 4 = 11 dollars.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 816: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance. 
* Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar. 
* Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt. 
* Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest. 

Let's say the amount of citrus zest (and fragrance) is x ounces. 

Since Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, we can use the same value for x for both.  We'll add these to our list of known values:

* Citrus zest (and fragrance) = x ounces.  

We're also told that Tanya uses twice as much salt as zest.  Since zest is x, salt must be 2x.  We'll add this to our list of known values:

* Salt = 2x ounces. 

Now, we're also told that Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar.   Since salt is 2x, sugar must also be 2x.   We'll add this to our list of known values:

* Sugar = 2x ounces. 

One more thing, Tanya uses twice as much oil as salt.   Since salt is 2x, oil must be 2(2x) or 4x.  We'll add this to our list of known values:

* Oil = 4x ounces. 







Let's get back to the problem: How many ounces of oil does she use?   We now know this (from our previous addition):

* Oil = 4x ounces.  This is the amount of oil.  To get ounces of oil, we just need to convert this into ounces.   We can do this by multiplying x by 4.  So the amount of oil is:

* Oil = 4x ounces = 4(oz).  We now have our end result: our oil is 4x ounces.  That's our answer. 
[EXP] 817: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4500, [output]:  John buys 3 goats for $500 each. 3 x 500 = 1500.  He also buys 2 cows for $1500 each. 2 x 1500 = 3000.  So in total, John spent 1500 + 3000 = 4500.  The answer is 4500. 
[EXP] 818: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 63 cupcakes are needed. 8 + 40 = 48 cupcakes are already available.  To find out how many more are needed, subtract: 63 - 48 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 819: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.  Robert has 20 cars, so Joe has 20 * 2 = 40 cars.  He sells 20% of them.  To find 20% of 40, multiply 40 by 20 / 100 = 8.  So Joe sells 8 cars.  He gives away twice as many cars as he sold to his mother.  8 * 2 = 16, so he gives away 16 cars.  If he sells 8 and gives away 16, he gets rid of a total of 8 + 16 = 24 cars.  After giving them away, Joe has 40 - 24 = 16 cars left.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 820: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6,250, [output]: 20 students are working together to raise money.  The charity raised a total of 175,000 dollars. 50,000 comes from organizations, so the students raised 175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000 dollars.  125,000 is the total amount raised by the students.  To find how much each student raised, we need to divide 125,000 by 20. 125,000 / 20 is 6,250.  The answer is 6,250 dollars. 
[EXP] 821: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 720, [output]: 8 hours is 8 x 60 = 480 minutes.  On the second day, Sandy walked half as many hours as on the first day, which is 8 / 2 = 4 hours. 4 hours is 4 x 60 = 240 minutes. 480 + 240 is 720 minutes.  The answer is 720. 
[EXP] 822: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  Hunter started with 50 cars and counted 20 more during the first break, so 50 + 20 = 70 cars. 1/2 of 70 is 35, so that's how many cars left the parking lot.  The number of cars he counted during lunch break are the cars that stayed in the parking lot.  So 70 - 35 = 35.  The answer is 35. 
[EXP] 823: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1260, [output]:  John does 30 cycles of work a day, so in one day he does 30 x 5 = 150 tasks and earns 150 x 1. 2 = 300 dollars.  He worked 7 days, so 300 * 7 = 2100 dollars.  The answer is 2100. 
[EXP] 824: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Sasha scored 14 points in the first game.  Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, so Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points in the first game.   Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie scored in the first game.   Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 points in the second game.  To find the total points scored by Sasha, we add her scores from both games:  14 + 4 = 18.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 825: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food. 8 packages of cat food have 8 * 11 = 88 tins.  Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food.  6 packages of dog food have 6 * 6 = 36 tins.  To find the difference, subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins: 88 - 36 = 52.  Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.  The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 826: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 153, [output]:  We can solve this problem by first finding out how many cards each person has.  Let's start with PJ.  Let's say PJ has x cards.  Smendrick has 3 times the amount, which is 3x.   Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, which is 3x + 12. 

We know the total number of cards is 341, so we can set up an equation: x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341. 

Combine like terms: 7x + 12 = 341.  Subtract 12 from both sides: 7x = 329.   Divide both sides by 7: x = 47.  

So PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 times that, which is 3(47) = 141 cards.  And Becca has 12 more than that, which is 141 + 12 = 153 cards.  The answer is 153. 
[EXP] 827: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's start by determining the number of blue eggs.  Since Cindy has twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, and she has 5 green eggs, she has 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.  Since she has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  Since she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.  In total, she has 5 green, 10 blue, 9 pink, and 3 yellow eggs.  5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27 eggs.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 828: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Let's first find the cost of shipping the book.  The book weighs 4 pounds, so the cost of shipping based on weight is 4 x $0. 35 = $1.  The book also needs to be shipped 20 miles, so the cost based on distance is 20 x $0. 08 = $1.   The cost of shipping is $1 + $1 = $2.  Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is 75% * $32 = $24.   Milly originally paid $32, so she will lose $32 - $24 = $8.  To this, she will also add the cost of shipping, which is $2.   Therefore, Milly will lose $8 + $2 = $10.   The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 829: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Mulan started with 40 dollars.  Her father gave her 100 dollars.  So now she has 40 + 100 = 140 dollars.  She then buys two pairs of jeans for 30 dollars each.  That is 2 * 30 = 60 dollars.  She also buys a bag for 20 dollars.   In total, she spent 60 + 20 = 80 dollars.  So, she has 140 - 80 = 60 dollars left.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 830: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14,000, [output]: 8,000 bars are produced in the first week. 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars are produced in the second week. 8,000 x 3 = 24,000 bars are produced in the third week.  The total produced is 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars. 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars left to produce, which is the amount produced in the fourth week.  The answer is 14,000 bars. 
[EXP] 831: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1128, [output]: 4-minute videos, 18 videos a week, means Britany spends 4 x 18 = 72 minutes a week recording videos.  She spends 2 hours writing amateur songs, which is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes a week.  Then she spends 15 minutes a day doing her makeup, and there are 6 days a week, so 6 x 15 = 90 minutes a week doing makeup. 

In a week, Britany spends 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes on TikTok.  There are 4 weeks in a month, so in a month, Britany spends 4 x 282 = 1128 minutes on TikTok.  The answer is 1128. 
[EXP] 832: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 324, [output]:  The interior design firm offers installation for 129 dollars.  This includes hanging 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures.  For Angela's additional installments, she needs more mirrors, chandeliers, and pictures.   

Angela needs 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors.  2 more mirrors will cost 2 * 15 = 30 dollars.   Angela also needs 2 chandeliers - 1 chandelier = 1 more chandelier.  1 more chandelier will also cost 1 * 15 = 15 dollars.   Angela needs 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures.  10 more pictures will cost 10 * 15 = 150 dollars.  So she needs to pay 30 + 15 + 150 = 195 dollars for the additional items.   Overall, she has to pay the original 129 dollars plus the additional 195 dollars, so 129 + 195 = 324 dollars.  The answer is 324. 
[EXP] 833: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  First, we must find out how much money Anthony has saved.  He has saved $10 more than Eve.  Eve saved $20.  So Anthony saved $20 + $10 = $30.  Since Roy has saved 40% more money than Anthony, we add 40% to Anthony's amount.   40% of $30 is $12.   So Roy has saved 30 + 12 = $42.  The answer is $42. 
[EXP] 834: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 1st, we know Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.  Since Pompei can lift 1 inch, Saskay can lift 12 x 1 inches = 12 inches.  Then, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay, so 12 x 4 = 48 inches.  Lastly, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so 48 x 10 = 480 inches.  There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so there are 480/12 = 40 feet.  Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 835: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Mason travels at a rate of 8 miles per hour.  He travels for 4 hours.  8 x 4 is 32.  Then he takes a break and travels for another 6 hours.  8 x 6 is 48.  So he traveled 32 + 48 = 80 miles in total.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 836: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 48, [output]: 18 hours is how long it took 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed to cross the highway.  

We need to know how long it would take 1 kangaroo to cross the highway. 18 / 3 = 6 hours for 1 kangaroo. 

Now we have to do the same thing with the turtles.  But the turtles are only moving at half the speed of the kangaroo.   So they're moving at 6 / 2 = 3 hours per turtle.  And there are 4 turtles.  So the total time it will take for the turtles to cross the highway is 4 * 3 = 12 hours.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 837: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 140, [output]: 1.  There are 3 clay dish makers.  They are Jada, Rory, and Kora.  There are 20 dishes initially made by Kora.  Since Rory makes 20 more than Kora, Rory makes 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.  Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, which is 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.  20 dishes made by Kora, 40 by Rory, and 80 by Jada, they all make 20 + 40 + 80 = 140 dishes in total.  The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 838: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 120, [output]: 1.  First, we need to know the price of the laptop if Erika trades in her old one.  The original price is $600, and it will be reduced by $200.  So the price becomes 600 - 200 = 400. 

2.  Erika already has some money in her purse, and she received $150 from her job and $80 from her mom.  If she now only needs $50 to buy the laptop, then she must have a total of 400 + 50 = 450 dollars now.  To find out how much money she had in her purse initially, we need to subtract the money she got from her job and her mom from the total money she has now: 450 - 150 - 80 = 220.  The answer is 220. 
[EXP] 839: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 15 apple slices are eaten. 3 large apples will be sliced into 3 * 5 = 15 pieces. 5 small apples will be sliced into 5 * 3 = 15 pieces. 15 + 15 = 30.  Since 15 were eaten and 30 were made, 30 - 15 = 15 apple slices are left.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 840: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 5 liters per cow means that 5 x 3 = 15 liters of milk are produced by 3 cows. 25 - 15 = 10. 10 liters are needed to reach 25 liters.  So 10 / 5 = 2 more cows are needed.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 841: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's find the total length of the glue sticks that are used, and then subtract that from the total original length of glue sticks.  The first glue stick has 1/6 left, which means 5/6 is used. 5/6 * 12 = 10 mm.   The second glue stick has 2/3 left, which means 1/3 is used. 1/3 * 12 = 4 mm.   The third glue stick has 1/2 left, which means 1/2 is used.  1/2 * 12 = 6 mm.  The total used length is 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 mm.   The total original length of glue sticks is 3 x 12 = 36 mm.  The total length of glue sticks that are not used is 36 - 20 = 16 mm.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 842: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5600, [output]:  Gabriel has a total of 5000 + 200 = 5200 dollars.  He needs to buy a car for 10000 dollars and a phone for 800 dollars. 10000 + 800 = 10800.  He has 5200 dollars, and needs 10800 - 5200 dollars more. 10800 - 5200 is 5600.  The answer is 5600. 
[EXP] 843: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 70 dollars is the price of the hat. 4 x 20 = 80 is the total amount of money Thea gave to the craftsman.  So Thea's change is 80 - 70 = 10 dollars.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 844: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Craig has 2 twenty-dollar bills. 2 x 20 = 40.  Craig bought 6 squirt guns for 2 dollars each, so that costs 6 x 2 = 12.  Craig also bought 3 packs of water balloons for 3 dollars each, so that costs 3 x 3 = 9.   Craig spent a total of 12 + 9 = 21 dollars.  After spending 21 dollars with a starting amount of 40 dollars, Craig has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 845: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information given.  We know:

- Jack collected 60 dishes. 
- Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack, so Peter has 60/2 = 30 dishes. 
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. 
- We don't know how many socks Jack has, but we can call it x. 
- Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so Peter has 2x socks.  Now we have: 

Peter has 30 dishes and 2x socks.  Jack has x socks and 60 dishes.  We want the total number of socks and dishes.  

The total number of socks is (Jack's socks) + (Peter's socks) = x + 2x = 3x socks.  The total number of dishes is (Jack's dishes) + (Peter's dishes) = 60 + 30 = 90 dishes.   In total, they have 3x socks and 90 dishes.  To find the total number of socks and dishes, we just add them: 3x + 90.  We know nothing about x, so this is just an expression.  However, it tells us the total number of socks and dishes Peter and Jack have.  The answer is 3x + 90. 
[EXP] 846: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 20 students are in the class. 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only.  That's a total of 5 + 8 = 13 students.  The rest of the students (20 - 13) are good at both math and English, which is 7 students.  But we are asked to find the total number of students who are good at math, including those who are good at both.  So, we add 5 students who are good at math only and 7 students who are good at both to get 12 students who are good at math.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 847: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]: 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes.  A 10-minute intermission will take 10 minutes, so we subtract that from the total. 120 - 10 = 110 minutes. 

For each group, it will take 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit.  That's 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes for each group.  We can fit 110 minutes ÷ 10 minutes per group = 11 groups.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 848: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 975, [output]: 300 is the original amount Brenda has.  The rate is three-quarters of the original amount per year.  Since it's simple interest, the interest earned each year is 300 * (3/4) = 225.  Over 3 years, the interest earned will be 225 * 3 = 675.  The total amount Brenda will have after 3 years is the original 300 plus the total interest of 675. 300 + 675 is 975.  The answer is 975. 
[EXP] 849: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 50% of the white shirts have collars, and the other 50% do not. 50% of 40 is 20 shirts.  So there are 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars. 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so there are 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons.  To find the difference, subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons: 30 - 20 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 850: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 900 eggs are originally in the farm. 900 eggs can be divided into trays of 30 eggs each. 900 divided by 30 is 30.  So there are 30 trays. 30 trays * $2. 5 per tray = $75.  The answer is $75. 
[EXP] 851: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  Mr.  Smith has 55 goats on Farm X and 45 goats on Farm Y.  So in total, he has 55 + 45 = 100 goats.  He sold 10 goats from Farm X and 10 * 2 = 20 goats from Farm  Y.   After selling those goats, 55 - 10 = 45 goats are left on Farm X, and 45 - 20 = 25 goats are left on Farm Y.  So altogether, he has 45 + 25 = 70 goats left.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 852: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]: 1 year has 12 months. 2 pairs per month means a total of 2 x 12 = 24 pairs of shoes per year. 2640 dollars for 24 pairs of shoes means $2640 / 24 = 110.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 853: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 123, [output]: 3 baskets of green food will cost 3 x 25 = 75 dollars. 3 baskets of red food will cost 3 x 18 = 54 dollars.  Since you get 2 dollars off each basket of red food, you'll actually pay 3 x 16 = 48 dollars for the red food.  In total, you'll have to pay 75 + 48 = 123 dollars.  The answer is 123. 
[EXP] 854: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 90 rooms at the KozyInn Motel. 1/2 of the rooms = 90 / 2 = 45 rooms. 45 rooms take 45 x 20 minutes = 900 minutes to clean. 1 hour = 60 minutes.  We need to find how many times 1 hour fits into 900 minutes. 900 / 60 is 15. 15 hours it takes to clean half of the rooms.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 855: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]:  In the first year, the town built 12 homes.  In the second year, they will build three times this many homes.  Three times 12 is 12 * 3 = 36.  So in the second year, they will build 36 homes.  

In the first year, the town built 12 homes.  In the second year, they will build 36 homes.   So far, they have built 12 + 36 = 48 homes.  In the third year, they will double this amount.   Double 48 is 48 * 2 = 96.  

So, in the first year, the town built 12 homes.  In the second year, they built 36 homes.   In the third year, they will double 48 and build 96 homes.   The total number of homes is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 856: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's start by analyzing the information given.  Since I am 3 years younger than my brother, and my sister is 2 years younger than me, we can say that my brother is x, I am x-3, and my sister is x-5.   My mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age, so her age is 3x-1.   Adding all our ages, we get (x) + (x-3) + (x-5) + (3x-1) = 87.   Simplifying this expression, we get 6x-9 = 87.   Adding 9 to both sides gives 6x = 96.   Dividing both sides by 6 gives x = 16.  So, my brother is 16, I am 16-3 = 13, and my sister is 16-5 = 11.  Therefore, I am 13.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 857: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Mr.  Jackson has 27 students.  He wants to give them 2 glue sticks each.  So for 27 students he needs 2 x 27 = 54 glue sticks.  The glue sticks come in packs of 8, so to know how many packs he needs, we divide 54 by 8.  54 / 8 = 6 with a remainder of 6.  That means we need 6 whole packs of glue sticks.  He wants excess glue sticks left over, so buying 6 packs of glue sticks will give him 6 x 8 = 48 glue sticks, with 6 extra.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 858: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14000, [output]: 4000 gallons of water is passing through the river at one point.  After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through doubles from 4000 to 8000 gallons (double the amount).  On the third day, the amount of water increases by 6000 gallons.  This is from 8000 to 14000 gallons. 8000 + 6000 is 14000.  So 14000 gallons are passing through the river.  The answer is 14000. 
[EXP] 859: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3430, [output]: 10 people are infected initially.  Each day, each person infects 6 others.  So on the first day, 6 * 10 = 60 more people become infected.  So there are 10 + 60 = 70 people infected.  On the second day, 6 * 70 = 420 more people become infected.  So there are 70 + 420 = 490 people infected.  On the third day, 6 * 490 = 2940 more people become infected.   So there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 people infected.  The answer is 3430. 
[EXP] 860: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1520, [output]: 40 customers gave Rafaela $20 each as a tip.  So she received 40 x 20 = 800 dollars.  Since Julieta received 10% less, she received 800 - (10/100) * 800 = 800 - 80 = 720 dollars.  The total tips they received together were 800 + 720 = 1520 dollars.  The answer is 1520. 
[EXP] 861: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Jennifer started with 12 oranges. 3 daughters got 2 oranges each, so they got 3 x 2 = 6 oranges total. 1 boy got 3 oranges.  So in total, 6 + 3 = 9 oranges were given away. 12 - 9 = 3 oranges remained with Jennifer.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 862: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 1 year is 12 months.  Claire earns 1 badge per month so she earns 12 badges.  Amber takes twice as long, so she earns half the amount, which is 6 badges in a year.  Wendy earns 3 times as much as Claire, so she earns 3 * 12 = 36 badges in a year.  To find out how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber, you subtract 36 - 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 863: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Paige bakes for 5 hours. 5 hours is the same as 5 x 1 hour = 5 hours.  For each hour, Paige bakes 2 loaves of banana bread.  So in 5 hours, she bakes 2 x 5 = 10 loaves.  Each loaf is cut into 8 slices.  10 loaves x 8 slices per loaf = 80 slices.  Each slice is sold for 50 cents.  So the total amount of money raised is 80 slices x 0. 50 = 40 dollars.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 864: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Let's start with the information that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.  Since Gretchen has 70 gold coins, that means she has 70 - 30 = 40 silver coins.  To find the total number of coins, we add the gold and silver coins: 70 (gold) + 40 (silver) = 110.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 865: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]: 600 burritos were ordered. 50 students each got 10 burritos, which is 50 x 10 = 500 burritos.  Mr.  George ate 20 burritos. 500 + 20 = 520 burritos eaten. 600 - 520 is 80.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 866: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's start by using the information given. 12 red cars. 2 fewer green cars than red cars means they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.  The number of blue cars is 3 times the number of green cars. 10 x 3 = 30 blue cars.  So, 12 red cars, 10 green cars, 30 blue cars, and some yellow cars, for a total of 75 cars. 12 + 10 + 30 is 52, so they must have 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 867: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Let's figure it out step by step!

Let's say Fawn has x books.  Since Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, Anne has x - 12 books.   Since Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, Sofie has (x - 12) + 25 books. 

We know that Sofie, Anne, and Fawn together have 85 books.  So the total number of books is:
x + (x - 12) + (x - 12 + 25) = 85

Combine like terms:
3x - 12 + 25 = 85
3x + 13 = 85
Subtract 13 from both sides:
3x = 72
Divide by 3:
x = 24

So Fawn has 24 books.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 868: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed 5 pounds.  She also bought a bag of sweet potatoes that weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes. 5 x 2 = 10.  So the sweet potatoes weighed 10 pounds.

Greg needs 12 boxes. 12 boxes cost 12 * 1. 25 = $15.  The answer is $15. 
[EXP] 870: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 500, [output]: 5 phones for 700 dollars each will cost 5 x 700 = 3500 dollars. 4000 dollars - 3500 dollars is 500 dollars. 500 dollars in change.  The answer is 500. 
[EXP] 871: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Madeline pays 60% of the cost, so Keenan pays the rest. 60% of $400 is $240. 400 - 240 is $160, which means Keenan pays $160. 160 dollars in a month means Keenan pays $40 per week, which is calculated by dividing 160 by 4. 160 / 4 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 872: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 60 is the total number of pieces of the pizza. 2/5 of the pizza means we subtract 2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces. 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.  Then, 10 more pieces are eaten, leaving 36 - 10 = 26 pieces left.  7/13 of the remaining means we subtract 7/13 * 26 = 14 pieces. 26 - 14 = 12 pieces left. 
On the first day, Tobias ate 24 pieces.  On the second day, he ate 10.  On the third day, he ate 14.  
So, in total, he ate 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 873: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]: 7 bottles of soda cost 21 dollars. 1 bottle of soda costs 21 / 7 = 3 dollars. 3 bottles of soda will be 3 x 3 = 9 dollars. 4 bottles of water cost 8 dollars, so 1 bottle of water costs 8 / 4 = 2 dollars.  2 bottles of water will be 2 x 2 = 4 dollars. 9 dollars for soda and 4 dollars for water will be 9 + 4 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 874: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 12. 48 dollars to begin with.  Each bolt costs 0. 03 dollars.  16 bolts for 0. 03 each will be 16 x 0. 03 = 0.  48.   So David pays 0.  48 dollars.   He has 12.  48 dollars.  After paying 0.  48 dollars, he has 12.   48 - 0.   48 = 12.   Now he has 12.  48 - 0.  48 = 12.    48.  So David has 12. 00 or 12 dollars and 00 cents left.  The answer is 12.

[EXP] 876: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Paul started with 52 marbles.  He was given 28 more, so he now has 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  After losing 1/4 of the marbles, he lost 80 / 4 = 20 marbles.  So he has 80 - 20 marbles left.  80 - 20 is 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 877: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 41, [output]:  First, let's figure out how many points Amy scores from the multiple-choice questions.  She got 80% of 10 questions, so 80/100 * 10 = 8 questions right.  Each question is worth 1 point, so she got 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.  Next, let's figure out how many points she got from the true/false questions.   She got 90% of 20 questions right, so 90/100 * 20 = 18 questions right.   Each question is worth 1 point, so she got 18 points from the true/false questions.  Then, let's figure out how many points she got from the long answer questions. 
[EXP] 878: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7000, [output]: 300 chickens and 3/5 of them were taken to the market, so 300 * (3/5) = 180 chickens.  Each chicken was sold at 50 dollars, so he earned 180 * 50 = 9000 dollars.  The question asks for how much money he bought the chicken for, so we subtract 2000 from 9000 to get 7000. 7000 is the amount of money he bought the chicken for.  The answer is 7000. 
[EXP] 879: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 32 glasses were sold in total.  Julie sold 14 glasses.  That means the boys sold 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.  Each boy sold 18 / 2 = 9 glasses.   Since Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9, Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.  The answer is 5.

Next, she bought 6 packets of chicken, each costing twice as much as a pack of bacon.  A pack of bacon costs 10 / 5 = 2 dollars.  So each packet of chicken costs 2 * 2 = 4 dollars.  Thus, the total cost of chicken is 6 * 4 = 24 dollars.  After buying the chicken, Kelly has 65 - 10 - 24 = 31 dollars left.  Then she bought 3 packs of strawberries, each costing 4 dollars, for a total of 3 * 4 = 12 dollars.  After these purchases, Kelly has 31 - 12 = 19 dollars left.   Finally, she bought 7 packs of apples, each costing half the price of a pack of strawberries.  A pack of strawberries costs 4 dollars, so a pack of apples costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The total cost of apples is 7 * 2 = 14 dollars.  Kelly has 19 - 14 = 5 dollars left in her budget.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 884: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 65 minutes is the total runtime, including the 15-minute encore. 65 - 15 = 50, so the runtime without the encore is 50 minutes. 50 is twice as long as her usual concerts, so the usual concerts run for 50 / 2 = 25 minutes.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 885: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Argo started with 200 toys. 40 toys were given to Alyssa.  200 - 40 = 160.  Then 80 toys were given to Bonnie.  160 - 80 = 80.  Then 30 toys were given to Nicky.  80 - 30 = 50.  Argo had 50 toys left.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 886: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 500, [output]: 125 + 125 + (125 x 2) = ?

There were 125 chimichangas on tuesday and 125 on wednesday. 2 times as many chimichangas are made on friday. 2 times 125 is 250. 125 + 125 + 250 = 500.  The answer is 500. 
[EXP] 887: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20% of the microphones are the ones that won't fit, so 80% will fit.  50 x 80/100 = 40, so the singer can arrange 40 microphones in pairs.  To obtain the number of pairs, we divide 40 by 2, which is 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 888: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 6 birds were nesting.  2/3 of 6 is 6 * 2/3 = 4.  So 4 more birds are flying overhead.  There are also 3 groups of 8 birds each, so 8 * 3 = 24 birds feeding.  Adding all together, we get 6 + 4 + 24 = 34 birds.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 889: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 55 cookies were baked. 5 cookies were eaten, so that leaves 55 - 5 = 50 cookies. 50 cookies are placed equally into 5 jars. 50 cookies / 5 jars = 10 cookies per jar. 10 cookies per jar is the answer. 
[EXP] 890: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of petals from the orchids.  Since there are 5 orchids, and each orchid has 5 petals, the total number of petals from the orchids is 5 x 5 = 25.  Next, we need to find the total number of petals from the daisies.   Since there are 4 daisies, and each daisy has 10 petals, the total number of petals from the daisies is 4 x 10 = 40.  Now we just need to subtract the number of petals from the orchids from the total number of petals from the daisies to find the number of more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids.  40 - 25 = 15.   The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 891: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 1/4 of the plants are indoor plants. 1/4 of 100 is 25.  So there are 25 indoor plants. 100 - 25 = 75 plants are remaining.  2/3 of those remaining plants are outdoor plants. 2/3 * 75 = 50.   So there are 50 outdoor plants.  The rest of the remaining plants are flowering plants.  75 - 50 = 25.   25 is the number of flowering plants.  To find the percent of flowering plants, you need to divide 25 by the total number of plants (100) and multiply by 100.   (25/100) * 100 = 25%.  The answer is 25%. 
[EXP] 892: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 55, [output]: 1st, let's find the speed of a thingamabob.  If a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster, and a whatchamacallit spins 121 meters per second (speed of whatchamacallit to thingamabob ratio is 11), then speed of thingamabob is:
121 / 11 = 11 meters per second
Now, we know the whirligig spins 5 times faster than a thingamabob.  So whirligig's speed is:
11 * 5 = 55 meters per second

The answer is 55. 
[EXP] 893: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Ellen's total cost per day is 11 dollars. 6 dollars for the salad and an unknown amount for the 2 carrots plus the yogurt.  But the yogurt is half the price of the salad, so the yogurt costs 6/2 = 3 dollars.  6 dollars for the salad and 3 dollars for the yogurt make 9 dollars, leaving 2 dollars for the 2 carrots.  2 dollars for the 2 carrots means 1 dollar for each carrot.  So the cost of each carrot is 1 dollar.  The answer is 1 dollar. 
[EXP] 894: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 480, [output]:  first, let's calculate how much Mark used to make a day.  He works 8 hours a day, making $10 an hour, so he used to make 8 x 10 = $80 a day.  For 5 days a week, that's 5 x 80 = $400 a week.  Now, since they raised his pay by $2, his new hourly wage is $10 + $2 = $12.   So his new daily wage is 8 x 12 = $96.  For 5 days, that's 5 x 96 = $480.  The answer is $480. 
[EXP] 895: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Let's start by identifying what we know:

Last month, Tasha made a total of $80.  From Joe's lawn, she earned $6.  From Kamala's lawn, she earned 3 x 6 = $18.  From Alba's lawn, she earned 5 x 6 = $30.   The sum of all this is 6 + 18 + 30 = 54, so she made $54 from mowing lawns. 

She had a total of $80.   The $80 - $54 she made from mowing lawns must be what she made from lemonade sales. 

$80 - $54 = $26

The answer is $26. 
[EXP] 896: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 74, [output]:  First, we find the weight of Carl: Martin's weight is 55 kg. 16 kg more than that is 55 + 16 = 71.  Then, we find Christian's weight: Carl's weight is 71 kg. 8 kg more than that is 71 + 8 = 79.  Finally, we find Harry's weight: Christian's weight is 79 kg. 5 kg less than that is 79 - 5 = 74.  The answer is 74. 
[EXP] 897: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  John rents his car 10 times a month, and each time it's for 3 hours.  So he earned 10 * 3 hours = 30 hours per month.  He gets paid 25 dollars an hour, so that's 30 * 25 = 750 dollars earned.  The car payment is 500, so his profit is 750 - 500 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 898: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Joseph has 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.  Let's say Martha has x notebooks.  Joseph has 3x notebooks.  Martha has 7 notebooks after buying 5 more.   So, x + 5 = 7.   x = 2. 

Now we know Martha has 2 notebooks.   Joseph has 3 times as many notebooks as Martha.   So, Joseph has 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.  Martha now has 7 notebooks, and Joseph has 6 notebooks. 7 - 6 = 1.  Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.  The answer is 1.

[EXP] 904: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  First, let's find out how much material is needed for one small mask and one large mask.  2 yards of material can make 4 small masks, so 1 yard can make 2 small masks.  To make one small mask, you need 1/2 yard of material.  2. 25 yards of material can make 3 large masks, so to make 1 large mask, you need 2. 25 / 3 = 0. 75 yards of material.   Now, let's find out how much material is needed in total to make 20 small and 8 large masks.   For 20 small masks, we need 20 * (1/2) = 10 yards of material.  For 8 large masks, we need 8 * 0. 75 = 6 yards of material.  So, in total, we need 10 + 6 = 16 yards of material.  The answer is 16.

[EXP] 906: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Harold sleeps for 10 hours.  He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.   He walks his dog for 1 hour.   In total, Harold spends 10 hours sleeping, 8 hours working, and 1 hour walking his dog.   That's a total of 19 hours.  Harold has 24 hours in a day.  So he has 24 - 19 = 5 hours free time.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 907: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 10, [output]:  There are 7 blue and 9 red shoeboxes originally. 3 blue shoeboxes and a third of the red shoeboxes will be used for fishing.  To find a third of the red shoeboxes, multiply 9 by one-third, which is 9 * (1/3) = 3.  So, 3 blue and 3 red shoeboxes will be used for fishing.  To find the number of shoeboxes left, subtract the used boxes from the original number of boxes.  For blue, 7 - 3 = 4 shoeboxes are left.  For red, 9 - 3 = 6 shoeboxes are left.   So, there are 4 blue and 6 red shoeboxes left in Tim's box.  The answer is 4 blue and 6 red. 
[EXP] 908: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Sarah has 9 books.  Joseph has twice as many, so he has 9 x 2 = 18 books.  After losing 2, he has 18 - 2 = 16 books.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 909: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  To find out how many marbles Dean gave to Jamie, we must calculate 1/5 of 30. 30 divided by 5 is 6. 6 is 1/5 of 30.  So he gave 6 marbles to Jamie.  Then he gave 10 to Donald.  In total, he gave 6 + 10 = 16 marbles. 30 - 16 = 14.   Dean has 14 marbles left.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 910: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.  If we call Duncan's current age "D" and Adam's current age "A", then eight years ago Duncan's age would be D-8 and Adam's age would be A-4.   We can set up the equation (D-8) = 2(A-4).  Simplifying the equation gives D-8 = 2A-8.   Now we know that Duncan's age is 60 now, so we can substitute D with 60.  60-8 = 2A-8, which becomes 52 = 2A-8.  Adding 8 to both sides gives 60 = 2A, and then dividing both sides by 2 gives A = 30.  This means Adam is currently 30 years old.  If we want to know how old Adam will be in 8 years, we just add 8 to his current age:  30 + 8 = 38.  So, Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 911: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  First, we find out how many acres Farmer Smith's farm is.  If Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, and Farmer Smith's farm is 100 acres more than twice that, then Farmer Smith's farm is 2 x 200 = 400 acres.  Add 100 acres to that, and we get 400 + 100 = 500.  So Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres.  In total, Farmer Brown's farm and Farmer Smith's farm are 200 + 500 = 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 912: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.  That means he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.  He works for 8 hours a day.  So he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages in a day.   Since he gets paid $0. 20 for each package, he earns 320 * 0. 20 = 64 dollars.  The answer is 64. 
[EXP] 913: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  If he finishes a normal sudoku puzzle in 45 minutes, that means he spends 3 half hours or 3 * 1 = 3 bottles of water on the normal puzzle.  An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long, which is 45 * 4 = 180 minutes.   Since he drinks a bottle of water every 30 minutes, he drinks 180 / 30 = 6 bottles of water on the extreme sudoku puzzle.  In total, he drinks 3 + 6 = 9 bottles of water.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 914: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  If Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, and there were 20 red balloons, he threw a total of 20 x 2 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.  This means that 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the remaining yellow balloons.  If 3 pieces of bologna were thrown at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 916: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Bruce worked 5 hours on Tuesday, so then he works 2 x 5 = 10 hours on Wednesday.  On Thursday, he works 10 - 2 = 8 hours.  Then we add all three to get 5 + 10 + 8 = 23.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 917: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, Julia and Nadine combined their allowance.  We don't know the amount, so let's represent it as "x".  

They spent $11 on a cake.  So they were left with $x - $11. 

They bought 1 dozen balloons, which is 12 balloons.  They sold the balloons in pairs, 2 balloons for $0. 5 each.   So they sold 12 ÷ 2 = 6 pairs, for a total of 6 x 0. 5 = $3.  They were left with $x - 11 - 3.   

They used the remaining money to buy 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.   So they spent 2 x 7 = $14 on ice cream.   They were left with $x - 11 - 3 - 14.   

Now, we know that this amount is 0, as everything was used up.   So we can set it up as an equation:

x - 11 - 3 - 14 = 0

Combine the constants:

x - 28 = 0

Add 28 to both sides:

x = 28

So, $28 was the amount of allowance that Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them.  The answer is 28.

So 6 + 12 = 18 students in total playing tennis or volleyball.  Now, 16 boys and 22 girls are playing soccer.  16 + 22 = 38 students enjoying soccer.  So in total there are 18 + 38 students.  18 + 38 is 56.  The answer is 56. 
[EXP] 920: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 30 students sold lollipops.  Each student sold 10 lollipops at $0. 8 per lollypop.  So the total amount they made is 30 x 10 x $0. 8 = $240. 

They bought the lollipops for $0. 5 each.  So their total expense is 30 x 10 x $0.  5 = $150. 

The amount of money they made in profit is $240 $150 = $90.  The answer is $90. 
[EXP] 921: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 47, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

Larry has 3 cats.  If he has 3 times as many dogs as cats, that means he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.  He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.  He has a fish tank with 3 times the number of fish as rabbits.   So he has 7 x 3 = 21 fish.  He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has.  So he has 21 ÷ 3 = 7 gerbils.  In total, he has 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 21 fish, and 7 gerbils.  This is a total of 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.  The answer is 47. 
[EXP] 922: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Abby can eat 2 slices a day.  Josh eats twice as much as her, so he eats 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.  So together they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices a day.  The loaf has 24 slices.  6 slices are eaten each day.  To find the number of days it will last, do 24 / 6.  24 divided by 6 is 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 923: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Martha has been collecting shells for 5 years.  She collects one shell per month, so she has collected 12 shells each year for 5 years. 12 * 5 = 60.  The answer is 60.

From these, some are taken for cinnamon tea.   27 - 15 = 12 cups are left.   The remaining 12 cups are for chamomile and mint tea.   There are 3 rows, so that's 12 / 3 = 4 cups per row for chamomile and mint tea combined.  Since they are equal amounts, 4/2 = 2 cups of mint tea are in each row.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 925: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's calculate how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours:

8 hours / 4 hours per trip = 2 trips

He can collect 24 berries in 8 hours.  The sloth can only make 2 trips down the tree to collect berries.  Let's solve for how many berries he can pick up per trip:

Total berries = Total trips * Berries per trip
24 = 2 * Berries per trip

To find the least number of berries, we'll divide both sides by 2:

Berries per trip = 24 / 2
Berries per trip = 12

The sloth can collect at least 12 berries on each trip to pick up 24 berries in 8 hours.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 926: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2000, [output]: 10000 gallons of water are in the pool.  They fill the tank with half the pool water, which is 10000 / 2 = 5000 gallons.  They use water from the tank at a rate of 500 gallons per day for 6 days.  500 x 6 = 3000 gallons were used.  So after 6 days, 5000 - 3000 = 2000 gallons of water are remaining in the tank.  The answer is 2000. 
[EXP] 927: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 150 - (5*10) - (8*7) - (2*8) - (4*2)

First, subtract the cost of the movies. 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday cost 5 * 10 = 50 dollars.  8 movies on other days cost 8 * 7 = 56 dollars.  We have already used 50 + 56 = 106 dollars.   Subtracting this from 150 leaves us with 150 - 106 = 44 dollars. 

Now, we have to subtract the cost of popcorn and the boxes of candy.   We have already purchased 2 tubs of popcorn, so that costs 2 * 8 = 16 dollars.   We also purchased 4 boxes of candy, so that costs 4 * 2 = 8 dollars. 

Adding these up, we have 16 + 8 = 24 dollars.  We are left with 44 - 24 = 20 dollars.  A movie ticket costs 10 dollars.  20 / 10 = 2.  COLBY CAN SEE 2 MORE MOVIES!.  The answer is 2.

The answer is 85000. 
[EXP] 929: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday, so she removed 39 x 2 = 78 on each of those days.  39 + 78 + 78 = 195.   Then she removed 48 more on Thursday and 57 more on Friday.   In total, she removed 195 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs.  Now we can divide 300 by 5 days to find the average.  300 / 5 = 60.   The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 930: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  The bus traveled at 60 miles per hour for 5 hours. 60 * 5 = 300 miles.  The car travels at 30 miles per hour for 8 hours. 30 * 8 = 240 miles.  The bus traveled 300 - 240 = 60 miles farther.  The answer is 60.

[EXP] 932: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than John.  So, Paul's age is x + 10 and John's age is x. 

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is x + 10 + x = 2x + 10. 

Now, we can write the equation that represents the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John: (2x + 10) + (x + 10) + x = 100. 

Combine like terms: 4x + 20 = 100.  Subtract 20 from both sides: 4x = 80.  

Divide by 4: x = 20.  Since John's age is x, that means John's age is 20 years old.   Since Paul's age is 10 years older than John's age, Paul's age is 30.  

And since Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, Peter's age is 30 + 20 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 933: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Maria had 4 friends and one for herself, so there were 5 people in total.  5 people were given 2 water balloons each, so that is 5 * 2 = 10 water balloons.  Then each person got 3 more.  That is an additional 5 * 3 = 15 water balloons.  So in total there were 10 + 15 = 25 water balloons.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 934: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each. 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. 50 + 10 = 60 boxes in total. 60 boxes fit 2 boxes per table. 60 / 2 = 30 tables. 15 tables are already owned. 30 - 15 = 15 more tables needed.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 935: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 410, [output]:  First, we need to find the total distance spat by each of them.  Zoey spits each seed 10 feet and has 40 seeds, so she spits in total 40 x 10 = 400 feet.  Sydney spits each seed 12 feet and has 35 seeds, so she spits in total 35 x 12 = 420 feet.  Next, we add together the total distance spat and divide by two to get the average.  400 + 420 is 820, and 820 / 2 = 410.  The answer is 410. 
[EXP] 936: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 64800, [output]:  Let's first calculate how many widgets each machine can make in a day and a month. 60 widgets per hour * 24 hours per day = 1440 widgets per day. 1440 widgets per day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets per month.  

Similarly, 45 widgets per hour * 24 hours per day = 1080 widgets per day.  1080 widgets per day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets per month.  The difference is 43,200 - 32,400 = 10,800 widgets per month. 

Each widget sells for 6 dollars.  We can multiply 10,800 widgets per month times 6 dollars per widget to get the difference in total earnings: 10,800 x 6 = 64,800.  The Widgeteer 3000 will make 64,800 more dollars than the WidgetMaster 9000.  The answer is 64,800. 
[EXP] 937: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 250, [output]: 12 hours will cost 1000 pesos. 8 additional hours at a rate of 70 pesos each would be 8 x 70 = 560 pesos.  The total cost would be 1000 + 560 = 1560 pesos.  But had he paid for 24 hours, the cost would be 1600 pesos.   So the difference is 1600 - 1560 = 40 pesos.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 938: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 159, [output]:  Each goat needs 5 pounds. 2 times that amount for a sheep is 2 * 5 = 10, so each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. 15 goats and 12 sheep need a total of 15 * 5 + 12 * 7. 15 * 5 = 75 and 12 * 7 = 84, so the total is 75 + 84 = 159.  The answer is 159. 
[EXP] 939: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 1.  John earns 50 dollars an hour. 6 hours of work will give him 50 x 6 = 300 dollars. 
2.  After spending 50 dollars on gas, he has 300 - 50 = 250 dollars. 
3.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, leaving him with 250 - 100 = 150 dollars.  He has this amount left.  The problem asks what he can buy after buying 5 pencils for 10 dollars each.  First, we need to subtract the cost of the pencils from the amount he has left.  5 pencils for 10 dollars each will cost 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  150 - 50 = 100 dollars.  So after spending 50 dollars on pencils, he has 100 dollars left.  Now the question asks how many 25-dollar pens he can buy.  To find this, we divide the amount he has left (100 dollars) by the cost of a pen (25 dollars). 100 ÷ 25 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 940: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 650, [output]:  Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. 15 letters per word, and Craig has spelled out 20 words, so Craig's total count of letters is 15 x 20 = 300.  Craig's brother has 50 more letters than that.  300 + 50 = 350.   So, in total, they have spelled out 350 + 300 = 650 letters.  The answer is 650. 
[EXP] 941: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 280, [output]:  Since there are 8 children in each row and there are 7 rows, the total number of children in one school is 8 x 7 = 56.  Since there are 5 different schools, the total number of children is 56 x 5 = 280.  The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 942: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 842, [output]: 29 pupils are in the class.  The teacher has 9 coupons; each can be redeemed for 100 bottles of apple juice. 9 x 100 is 900.  900 bottles of apple juice are available in total.  For lunch, each of the 29 pupils gets 2 bottles of apple juice.  That's a total of 2 x 29 = 58 bottles.  After all pupils have got their apple juice, the teacher will have 900 - 58 = 842 bottles left.  The answer is 842.

[EXP] 944: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  James gets 10 CDs.  Each CD is 15 dollars.  But he got them 40% off.  That means they were 15 - 15 * 0. 4 = 9 dollars.  So he spent 10 * 9 = 90 dollars.  He sold 5 for 40 dollars.   So he is out 90 - 40 = 50 dollars.  The answer is 50 dollars. 
[EXP] 945: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 6 yams are worth 6 x 1. 5 = 9 dollars, 10 sweet potatoes are worth 10 x 2 = 20 dollars, and 4 carrots are worth 4 x 1. 25 = 5 dollars.  In total, Jen will earn 9 + 20 + 5 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 946: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  James has to swim 20 miles, but he only swims 60% of the distance, which is 0. 6 x 20 = 12 miles.  The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles.  After swimming 12 miles, he stops on an island and rests for half as long as the time it took him to swim.  We can calculate the time he swam by dividing the distance by his speed:  12 / 2 = 6 hours.  So, he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.  Now we need to calculate the time it takes him to finish the remaining 8-mile distance with a speed of half his normal speed.  His normal speed is 2 miles per hour, so the reduced speed is 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour.   The remaining distance can be swum in 8 / 1 = 8 hours.  Therefore, the total time he takes to swim across the lake is 6 hours (swimming) + 3 hours (resting) + 8 hours (finishing).  The answer is 17 hours. 
[EXP] 947: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 450, [output]:  Sam had 70 loaves of bread last Friday. 7 times that is 7 x 70 = 490. 40 less than that is 490 - 40 = 450.  The answer is 450. 
[EXP] 948: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Jasmine started with 15 stickers.  She lost 7 stickers during playtime, so she had 15 - 7 = 8 stickers left.  Then she got 5 more stickers for helping her classmates.  So she had 8 + 5 = 13 stickers.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 949: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 1. 6 copies of the New York Times at $5 each is 6 x $5 = $30. 10% of $30 is 30 x 10/100 = $3.  3 dollars commission on 6 New York Times copies. 2.  10 copies of Wall Street Journal at $15 each is 10 x $15 = $150.   8% of $150 is 150 x 8/100 = $12.  12 dollars commission on 10 Wall Street Journal copies.  3.  The total commission is 3 dollars (from 6 New York Times copies) + 12 dollars (from 10 Wall Street Journal copies) = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 950: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  We can use the information that Deanna is 26 years old and Marcus is five years younger than her.  This means Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21 years old.  Since Marcus is half of Leo's age, this means Leo's age is twice Marcus's age, or 2 x 21.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 951: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Bahati scored the most points, and it was 20 more than Azibo scored.  Let's say Azibo scored x points.  Then Bahati scored x + 20 points.  Dinar scored 10 points less than Bahati, so Dinar scored (x + 20) - 10 = x + 10 points.  Together, they scored 45 points.  x + (x + 20) + (x + 10) = 45.   We can combine like terms: 3x + 30 = 45.  Subtract 30 from both sides: 3x = 15.  Divide both sides by 3: x = 5.   So Azibo scored 5 points.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 952: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 300, [output]: 100 pages are to the inch.  If the book is 1. 5 inches thick, that means it would hold 100 * 1. 5 = 150 pages.  But, each page is used on both sides.   So we have 150 divided by 2, or 75 pages in the book.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 953: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 360, [output]: 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is 15 hours.  Since he can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, he can staple 30 x 4 = 120 reports every hour.  Since he stapled reports for 15 hours, he stapled a total of 120 x 15 = 1800 reports.  The answer is 1800. 
[EXP] 954: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 452, [output]:  Kim usually sleeps for 8 hours. 10 p. m.  is the bedtime, and 6 a. m.  is the wake-up time.  10 p.  m.   to 6 a.  m.   is 8 hours.   She woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom, so instead of waking up at 6 a.  m.  , she woke up at 5:55 a.   m.   The start of the sleepwalking episode was at 2:15 a.   m.  and the end was at 2:38 a.    m.    To find the duration of sleepwalking episode, we will subtract the start time from the end time.   2:38 a.  m.    minus 2:15 a.    m.    is 23 minutes. 
[EXP] 955: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Jonathan has 2 dozen cups which is 24 cups. 2/3 of 24 is 16.  So he has 16 measuring spoons.  He gave Pedro 6, so he has 16 - 6 = 10 spoons left.  Since he had 24 cups from the beginning, he still has 24 cups.  The total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is 24 cups + 10 spoons = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 956: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 1/5 of the beds in the hospital are occupied. 1/5 of 1000 is 200.  So 200 beds are occupied, which means 1000 - 200 = 800 beds are unoccupied.  Since 50 patients are admitted each day, in 14 days, 50 * 14 = 700 patients will be admitted.  So 200 + 700 = 900 beds will now be occupied.  Then the number of unoccupied beds will be 1000 - 900 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 957: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Robyn sends 16 emails a day. 7 of them are work emails, so 16 - 7 = 9 emails are left. 2/3 of the remainder are to family.  2/3 of 9 is 6, so 6 emails are to family. 9 - 6 is 3, so 3 emails are left. 1/3 of these 3 emails are to her boyfriend.  1/3 of 3 is 1, so Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend a day.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 958: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  If Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna is 3 times as old as Aliya, so Shawna is 3 * 3 = 9 years old.  If Shawna is 9 years old, her father is 5 times as old as her.  5 * 9 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 959: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 40, [output]: 48 is the number given by Courtney. 20% above 48 would be 48 + (20% of 48).  20% of 48 is 9.  So we need to add 9 to 48 to find the original number: 48 + 9 = 57.  The correct number of people in attendance is 57.  The answer is 57. 
[EXP] 960: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Coach brought some balls.  3 boys, Jordan, Jason, and Jeffrey, picked up all the balls together in one trip.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason.  Jason carried twice as many balls as Jeffrey.  If Jason carried 2 balls, then Jeffrey carried 1 because 1 is half of 2.  Jordan carried twice as many balls as Jason, so Jordan carried 2 x 2 = 4.  So in total, they carried 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.   Coach initially had some balls.  The boys picked up all the balls, so they picked up the same number of balls that coach had.  Therefore, 7 is the number coach brought.  If you do not like this explanation, we assume the question does not require that we find the total number of balls the boys picked.  In this case, we must find the number of balls that the coach brought.   The first statement tells us that 3 boys picked up all the balls in one trip.  The second statement tells us that Jordan counted twice as many balls as Jason, and Jason counted twice as many balls as Jeffrey.  If Jason counted 2 balls, then Jeffrey counted 1 ball.   So Jordan counted 2 x 2 = 4 balls.  So the total number of balls the 3 boys picked up is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.   Since the boys picked up all the balls that the coach brought, the coach brought 7 balls.  Coach initially had some balls.  The boys picked up all the balls, so they picked up the same number of balls that coach had.  Therefore, 7 is the number coach brought.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 961: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  The pirates dug 10 holes on the first day. 13 holes on the second day, and 8 holes the third day.  That is a total of 10 + 13 + 8 = 31 holes.  Then they filled in 2 holes.  So there are 31 - 2 = 29 holes.  On the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as at the end of the first day, so it should have 4 x 10 = 40 holes.  But the pirates had already dug 29 holes.   So they dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day.   The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 962: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 225, [output]:  Let's first find how much corn chips the other person got. 70 + 70 = 140.  Since this person got 15 more than the others, that means they got 140 + 15 = 155 corn chips.  Now we know that 2 people got 70 each, and the third person got 155.  To find the total, we add 2 x 70 = 140, plus 155.  That's 140 + 155 = 295.  The answer is 295. 
[EXP] 963: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1000, [output]: 400 dollars are needed for supplies.  The tickets for travel cost 50% more than the supplies.  So the cost of the tickets is:

400 * (1 + 0. 50) = 400 * 1. 50 = 600

So the cost of the tickets is 600 dollars.  The total cost is the cost of supplies and the cost of the tickets, which is:

400 + 600 = 1000

The answer is 1000. 
[EXP] 964: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 147, [output]:  Start by defining variables:

Let x be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught. 
Let s be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught. 
Let a be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught. 

We know the total number of Pokémon caught is 339, so:
x + s + a = 339

We know Stan has caught 5 more than Alex, so:
a = s - 5

And we know Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, so:
s = 4x - 13

Substitute the expressions for s and a into the first equation:
x + (4x - 13) + (s - 5) = 339

Combine like terms:
x + 4x - 13 + s - 5 = 339

Simplify:
5x + s - 18 = 339

Now substitute the expression for s into the equation:
5x + (4x - 13) - 18 = 339

Combine like terms:
5x + 4x - 13 - 18 = 339

Simplify:
9x - 31 = 339

Add 31 to both sides:
9x = 370

Divide both sides by 9:
x = 41

Now that we know the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught, we can find the number of Pokémon Stan has caught:
s = 4x - 13
= 4(41) - 13
= 164 - 13
= 151

So Stan has caught 151 Pokémon.  The answer is 151. 
[EXP] 965: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]:  There is a trick in this problem! The problem says there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode.  That means if there are 20 minutes per episode, there are 20/2 = 10 episodes.  So John will watch 10 episodes.  Since each episode is 20 minutes long, he will watch 20 * 10 = 200 minutes in total.  The answer is 200. 
[EXP] 966: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 374, [output]:  To solve this problem, we have to break it down into three parts.  The bird starts by flying for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.   To find the distance, we multiply the speed and time: 10 * 30 = 300 miles.  So, the bird flew 300 miles south.   Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.    2 * 18 = 36 miles.   So, the bird flew 36 miles north.   Then, the bird flies south for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour.    5 * 22 = 110 miles.  So, the bird flew 110 miles south.   We can't just add the distance directly because there is a northward direction in between.   We have to subtract 36 from 300 to find the net southward distance.  300 - 36 is 264.  Then, we have to add the final southward distance of 110.  264 + 110 is 374 miles.  The answer is 374. 
[EXP] 967: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Let's start with the brownies Greta had.  She made a batch for herself, which is one dozen.  Then she got 1/2 dozen from her office.  1 dozen is 12, and 1/2 dozen is 6, so she now has 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.  When she arrived home, her friends gave her 4 dozen, which is 48 brownies.  Now she has 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.  Then, 1 1/2 dozen or 18 brownies were eaten during the party.   So, Greta has 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 968: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's start with Nani.  He is 8 years old.  His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 8 x 2 = 16 years old.  His sister is 25% younger than him, so she is 8 - (25% of 8) = 8 - 2 = 6 years old.  To find the total age of all three of the family members, we add their ages: 8 + 16 + 6 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 969: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 227, [output]: 3 racquets with synthetic gut: 3 x 15 = 45 minutes
5 racquets with polyester string: 5 x 22 = 110 minutes
4 racquets with hybrid sets: 4 x 18 = 72 minutes

Add total time: 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 minutes

Answer: 227 minutes. 
[EXP] 970: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1800, [output]:  John must buy 4 phones.  The first 2 phones are full price at $600.  The next 2 phones are half price, which is 600 / 2 = 300.  So the total is 2 x 600 + 2 x 300. 2 x 600 is 1200 and 2 x 300 is 600. 1200 + 600 is 1800.  The answer is 1800. 
[EXP] 971: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 33, [output]:  Zeke's team has 7 more players than Carlton's, so Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.  In total, there are 13 from Carlton's team and 20 from Zeke's team. 13 + 20 = 33.  The answer is 33. 
[EXP] 972: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  To find the total length of fencing Robert needs to build, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden.  The formula to calculate the perimeter is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.  So, the total length of fencing Robert needs is 2(15 + 10) = 2 x 25 = 50 feet.  Since he needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing, he will need 50 * 2 = 100 wooden slats.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 973: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Mrs.  Harrington started with 12 boxes of oranges.  Each box has 20 oranges.  So she had 12 x 20 = 240 oranges.  She gave 2 boxes each to her mom and sister, so she gave away 2 x 2 = 4 boxes. 4 boxes times 20 oranges each is 4 x 20 = 80 oranges.  So she gave away 80 oranges.  She had 240 - 80 = 160 oranges left.  She kept 1/4 of the oranges. 1/4 of 160 is 160/4 = 40.  So she sold 160 - 40 = 120 oranges.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 974: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  The USA has 50 states.  Half of 50 is 25. 4 more than that is 25 + 4 = 29.  That is the number of states India has. 29 + 50 is 79, so the total number of states in both countries together is 79.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 975: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Tyler has 14 dollars saved. 14 is short of the total cost of the books, which is 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 dollars. 39 - 14 = 25 dollars, so Tyler needs to earn the remaining 25 dollars.  In order to earn 25 dollars at 5 dollars per hour, Tyler would have to work 25/5 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 976: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 60 cherries were shared among 3 people. 30 cherries were given to Robert.  That leaves 60 - 30 = 30 cherries for Richard and Jerry.  Since Robert has 10 more than Richard, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.  Then Jerry has the remaining amount which is 30 - 20 = 10 cherries.  Robert has 30 cherries and Jerry has 10 cherries, so Robert has 30 - 10 = 20 more cherries than Jerry.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 977: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 540, [output]: 10 boxes of gingerbread were sold on Saturday, and 10 + 5 = 15 boxes on Sunday. 4 fewer boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday, so let's call the number of boxes sold on Saturday x.  On Sunday, 15 boxes were sold.  So x - 4 + 15 = the number of boxes sold on Sunday.  That is, x + 11 = 15.  Solving for x, we get x = 4.  So 4 boxes of apple pie were sold on Saturday and 15 on Sunday.  On Saturday, 10 boxes of gingerbread were sold for $6 each, so 10 x 6 = $60.  On Sunday, 15 boxes of gingerbread were sold, also for $6 each, so 15 x 6 = $90.  On Saturday, 4 boxes of apple pie were sold for $15 each so 4 x 15 = $60.  On Sunday, 15 boxes of apple pie were sold, also for $15 each, so 15 x 15 = $225.   Total revenue for Saturday is $60 + $60 = $120.  Total revenue for Sunday is $90 + $225 = $315.  The total revenue for two days is $120 + $315 = $435.  The answer is $435. 
[EXP] 978: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Pamela reapplies 1 ounce of sunscreen every hour.  She will be outside 4 hours each day for 8 days.  That is 4 x 8 = 32 hours total.  She will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.  32 ounces is equal to how many 8-ounce bottles? 32 ÷ 8 = 4.  So she needs to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 979: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]: 40% of $100 is $40. 40% cheaper is the same as $100 - $40, which is $60.  The cost of the red car is $60.  For both cars, you would add: $60 + $100.  The answer is $160. 
[EXP] 980: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Emil will be 24 in some time.  Then he will be half the age of his dad.  So his dad must be 2 * 24 = 48.  This means his dad is currently 48 - 19 = 29 years old. 

He will also be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24.  So his brother will be 24 / 2 = 12 years old then.  This means his brother is currently 12 - 19 = 7 years old.  To get the sum of their ages, we add 29 + 7.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 981: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Adrianne started with 20 metallic beads from her mom.  Her sister gave her 10 more than that, so that's 20 + 10 = 30.  Her friend gave her twice as many as her mom, so that's 2 x 20 = 40.  Now, let's add up the number of beads she got from each person: 20 + 30 + 40 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 982: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  On Thursday, Joe caught 3 pounds.  On Friday, he caught 4 times that amount, so 4 x 3 = 12 pounds.  On Saturday, he caught half the amount of Friday's catch, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.  So he caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds in total.  Since 1 serving is 3 pounds, we need to find out how many 3-pound servings there are in 21 pounds.  21 / 3 = 7.  So Joe has 7 servings.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 983: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 20% of 30 students are football players.  20/100 * 30 = 6 football players.  So there are 30 - 6 = 24 remaining students.   25% of the remaining are cheerleaders or part of band.  25/100 * 24 = 6.  So there are 6 students in these 2 groups.  In total, 6 football players and 6 cheerleaders/part of band are leaving early, which is 6 + 6 = 12 students.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 984: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Charlie's boots are 5 times the size of Sophie's.  Sophie's boots are size 5.  So Charlie's boots are 5 * 5 = 25.  To find the average of the two, you add them together and divide by 2.   5 + 25 is 30.  Divide by 2, you get 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 985: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 342, [output]: 1 foot is the same as 12 inches. 1. 5 feet is the same as 1. 5 x 12 = 18 inches.  Since the flowers are 12 inches wide, Pat needs to leave a gap of 18 inches between every plant.  Therefore, the number of plants that will fit in the bed is 111 x 12/ (18 + 12) = 111 x 12/30 = 111 x 2/5 = 44. 2/5.  44 - 17 = 27.  Pat needs 27 more plants.  Each plant costs $6.  27 x 6 = 162.  Pat will spend $162 at the store.  The answer is 162. 
[EXP] 986: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 63, [output]:  Edgar's brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar.  Edgar eats 18 pretzels each day.  So his brother eats 18/2 = 9 pretzels each day.  If his brother eats this many for 7 days in a week, he eats 9 x 7 = 63 pretzels.  The answer is 63. 
[EXP] 987: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]: 5 hanging baskets.  For each basket, Katherine needs to add 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.  For petunias, that's 3 x 5 = 15 petunias.  For sweet potato vines, that's 2 x 5 = 10.  15 petunias and 10 sweet potato vines.  Petunias cost $3 apiece, so 15 petunias will cost 15 x $3 = $45.  Sweet potato vines cost $2. 50 apiece, so 10 sweet potato vines will cost 10 x $2. 50 = $25.  In total, Katherine will spend $45 + $25 = $70.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 988: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 30-pound bag of soil. 

4 sunflowers need 4 x 3 = 12 pounds, and 10 carnations need 10 x 1. 5 = 15 pounds. 12 + 15 = 27.  So 27 pounds are taken.  

To find out how much soil is left, we need to subtract 27 from 30. 30 - 27 = 3 pounds left.  

Each rose needs 1 pound, so the number of roses they can plant is 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 989: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Jessica makes $2000 per month. 25% of her paycheck is set aside towards shoes. 25% of 2000 is 25/100 * 2000 = 500. 500 dollars per month is set aside. 500 * 12 (months in a year) is 6000 dollars in a year. 6000 dollars is enough to buy 6 pairs of shoes. 6000/1000 is 6.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 990: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute.  To peel 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 6 = 15 minutes. 

Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.  To saute 90 shrimp, it will take her 90 / 30 = 3 times as long as 10 minutes.   3 * 10 = 30.  So it will take her 15 minutes to peel and 30 minutes to saute.   They both are independent, so it will take her 15 + 30 = 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 991: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Initially, the room is at some temperature, say x.  Then, it warms up 2 degrees for 3 hours.  In 3 hours, it will warm up 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.  So the temperature becomes x + 6. 

Then the air conditioner turns high and it cools 3 degrees per hour for 4 hours.  In 4 hours, it cools 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.  So the temperature becomes x + 6 - 12 = x - 6.  

Finally, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours.  In 2 hours, it warms up 2 * 2 = 4 degrees.   So, the temperature becomes x - 6 + 4 = x - 2.   

The difference between the starting temperature x and the final temperature x - 2 is -2 degrees.  So the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the starting temperature.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 992: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's first find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.  Bill's father was 30 years old when he saw the Comet.  Bill was three times his father's age when he saw the Comet, so Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old.   Bill's father saw the Comet 75 years ago, so if Bill was 90 when he saw it the second time, he was 90 - 75 = 15 when he saw it the first time.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 993: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Once per month, Buford writes a check to pay the electric bill.  So that's 12 times per year.  He also writes a check every month for the gas bill.   So that's 12 times per year.   Twice per month, he writes a check to the church.   That's 2 x 12 = 24 times per year.  And quarterly, he writes a check to the pest and lawn service.  That's 4 times a year.  To find the total number of checks, we add 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = 52.  The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 994: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* The first plane makes x trips each day (we don't know the exact number yet). 3/4 of these trips go to Greece, and the remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany.  Let's say the number of trips to France is f. 
* The other plane makes 44 trips to Poland exclusively, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes (since it's asking for half). 
* We are trying to find the number of flights to France taken by the first plane in one day.  Let's call this number f. 

We can start by using the information that the second plane makes 44 trips to Poland, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes:

44 = 1/2 * x

We can multiply both sides by 2 to get:

88 = x

So the first plane makes 88 trips each day.  Now, we know that 3/4 of these trips go to Greece.  This means:

3/4 * 88 = 66

trips to Greece

The remaining trips are split equally between France and Germany.   Since there are 88 - 66 = 22 trips remaining, we can divide this number by 2 to find the number of trips to France:

22 / 2 = 11

So the first plane takes 11 trips to France each day.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 995: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, so 2 x 20 = 40 seconds.  Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which is 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.   The total howling time is 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.   There are 60 seconds in one minute, so to find the total howling time in minutes, we divide 120 by 60. 120 ÷ 60 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 996: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 30 dollar trousers.  His mom gave 6 and his dad gave 6 x 2 = 12. 6 + 12 = 18.  Adam has 18 dollars from his parents. 30 - 18 = 12.  Adam has to contribute 12 dollars from his savings.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 997: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's first calculate the average age of the group. 20 is the total age of the 4 children.  So, if we divide 20 by 4, we get the average age of the group: 20 / 4 = 5. 

Helene is twice as old as the average age, so Helene's age is 2 * 5 = 10. 

Now we have the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene: 3, 4, and 10, respectively.  From this, we can subtract these three ages from the total age 20 to find Wilfred's age: 20 - (3 + 4 + 10) = 20 - 17 = 3.  

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 998: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6,600, [output]:  Walter's lawyer will contribute 3 times the total donations until that point.  

Firstly, Walter's neighbors give him $500.  

Then he gets $1500 from his online fund.  

So the total donations before his friend gives another $200 is $500 + $1500 = $2000.  

Now Walter's friend gives him an additional $200.  The total donations until then are $2000 + $200 = $2200. 3 times that is $6600.  Walter's lawyer donates $6600.  The answer is 6600. 
[EXP] 999: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 100 guests at the reception each brought 15 cookies, so the total number of cookies is 100 * 15 = 1500. 1500 cookies divided by 2 (since half were given to the church) is 750 cookies. 750 cookies, if each person in the church got 15 cookies, means 750 ÷ 15 = 50 people in the church.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 1000: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]: 2 adults and 4 kids makes 6 people.  Each adult gets a slice twice as big as each kid, so adults will get 2/3 of the watermelon (used percentages for 2/3).  Adults get 2/3 of watermelon. 1/3 is left for 4 kids.  1/3 divided by 4 kids makes 1/12 per kid.  This is what a kid gets.   Each adult gets 2 times the kid's portion.  So, 2 x 1/12 = 1/6 of watermelon.  2/3 - 1/6 = 1/2.  This is what adults get.  The answer is 50%. 
[EXP] 1001: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 9 clinic hours will be taken up by rounds and appointments, but we need to calculate how much time those will take. 

Rounds: 9 inpatients at 20 minutes each will take 9 x 20 minutes = 180 minutes.  Converting this to hours, we get 180 / 60 = 3 hours.  Doctor Jones will spend 3 hours on rounds.  Appointments: 10 appointments, each taking 30 minutes. 10 x 30 = 300 minutes.  300/60 = 5 hours.  Doctor Jones will spend 5 hours on appointments.   Altogether, rounds and appointments will take 3 + 5 = 8 hours out of his 9-hour day.   He will have 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records.  The answer is 1 hour. 
[EXP] 1002: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  First, Jordan has to make the cake batter which takes 20 minutes.  Then she has to bake the cake which takes 30 minutes.  So far, she has used 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.   Then she needs to let the cake cool for 2 hours which is 120 minutes.   So now she has used 50 + 120 = 170 minutes.   After the cake has cooled, she has to frost it which takes 10 minutes.   So she has used 170 + 10 = 180 minutes.  The cake will be ready at 5:00pm.   180 minutes is equal to 3 hours.   3 hours before 5:00 pm is 2:00 pm.   Therefore, Jordan must start making the cake at 2:00 pm or earlier to have it ready to serve at 5:00 pm.  The answer is 2:00 pm. 
[EXP] 1003: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 8.  Let's break it down step by step.  Let x be the number of chocolate bars in a box.  The equation is (3. 5x) + (4. 5x) = 64.   Let's convert these mixed numbers to fractions.  We get (7x/2) + (9x/2) = 64  Combine like terms to get 16x/2 = 64  Simplify by multiplying both sides by 2 to get 16x = 128  Divide both sides by 16 to get x = 8.  So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 1004: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 480, [output]:  First, let's figure out the cost of 1 session.  The cost to rent the studio is $25.  The cost per student per session is $1. 50.   Since there are 10 students, the cost for the students is 10 x $1. 50 = $15.   So for one session, the total cost is $25 + $15 = $40. 

Since the dance studio is rented 3 days a week, that means they have 3 x $40 = $120 per week.  Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the studio will have 4 x $120 = $480 in one month.  The answer is $480. 
[EXP] 1005: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Peter has 4 boxes and 64 chocolate bars in total.  So, he has 64 / 4 = 16 bars per box.  Martha has 7 boxes and 56 chocolate bars in total.   So, she has 56 / 7 = 8 bars per box.   The difference between the number of bars per box is 16 - 8 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 1006: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1490, [output]: 50 is the total population.  3/5 of it are female.  To find the number of female porcupines, we can multiply the total population by 3/5.  50 * 3/5 = 30.  So there are 30 female porcupines.  Each female gives birth to 4 babies every month.  Since there are 12 months in a year, each female gives birth to 4 * 12 = 48 babies every year.  So the total number of babies born every year is 30 * 48 = 1440.   In total, there are 50 porcupines initially and 1440 new ones after a year. 50 + 1440 = 1490.  The answer is 1490. 
[EXP] 1007: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 826, [output]:  First, we need to find the volume of the pool.  To do this, we need to find the area of the base of the pool, then multiply it by the height (depth) of the pool.  The formula for the area of a rectangle is length * width.   In this case, the length is 25 feet and the width is 14 feet.   So the area of the base of the pool is 25 * 14 = 350 square feet. 

Next, we need to find the volume of the pool.   The volume of a rectangular prism is length * width * height.   So the volume of the pool is 350 * 4 = 1400 cubic feet.  Then, we multiply this volume by 5.  5 * 1400 = 7000.  So, the pool company needs 7000 gallons of water to fill the pool.  Finally, to find the cost of filling the pool, we multiply the gallons of water needed by the cost per gallon ($0. 10 per gallon).  So the cost is 7000 * $0. 10 = $700.  The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 1008: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that there are 5 more blue sticks than red.  This means the number of blue sticks is 9 + 5 = 14.  We know that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks, so the number of yellow sticks is 14 - 3 = 11.  To find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red sticks (9) to the number of blue sticks (14) and the number of yellow sticks (11).   9 + 14 + 11 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 1009: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]:  First, we need to find how many miles Matteo traveled.  He traveled at 55 mph for 4 hours, so that is 55 * 4 = 220 miles.  Then, we need to find how many miles Shandy traveled.  She traveled at 45 mph for 10 hours, so that is 45 * 10 = 450 miles.  To find how much farther Shandy traveled, we need to subtract the miles Matteo traveled from the miles Shandy traveled: 450 - 220 = 230.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 1010: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1,875, [output]: 3000 students attend Brook Hills High School.  Half of them, or 3000 / 2 = 1500, are over 16 years old.  The other half, or 1500, are under 16 years old. 

One-fourth of the 16 or older students are male, so that is 1500 / 4 = 375 males and 1500 - 375 = 1125 females over 16.  The remaining 1500 students are under 16.  One-half of these, or 1500 / 2 = 750, are male, leaving 1500 - 750 = 750 females under 16.  In total, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students at this school.  The answer is 1875. 
[EXP] 1011: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the number of laps each person can run:

* Shaelyn: 14 / 2 = 7 laps
* Quinn: 7 - 2 = 5 laps

Now, let's find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:. 10 (Bethany) - 5 (Quinn) = 5.  Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.   The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1012: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6000, [output]:  Let's break this problem down into parts.  On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water, which is 18000/4 = 4500 gallons.  Ms.  B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda, so Ms.  B pumped 4500 x 3/4 = 3375 gallons.  In total, they pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons on the first day.  On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the 4500 gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 4500 x 2/3 = 3000 gallons.  Ms.  B pumped 1/3 of the 3375 gallons she pumped on the first day, which is 3375 x 1/3 = 1125 gallons.   In total, they pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day.  So in total, they pumped 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.  The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.  The amount of water remaining is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.  The answer is 6000. 
[EXP] 1013: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 94, [output]: 1st part - 9% loss each hour. 5 hours means 5 * 9% = 45% charge lost. 100% - 45% = 55% charge left. 55% is what’s left after 5 hours of 9% loss. 

2nd part - 7% loss each hour.  It happened for 3 hours.  3 * 7% = 21% charge lost.  So from 55%, it lost 21%.  55% - 21% = 34%.  34% is the charge left after the transition from 9% to 7% loss. 

We know 34% is left in the end, which is the final state.  We need to find the starting charge before going to the park.  What was the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?.  If the final state charge is 34%, and then it was 28% originally before losing 6% (100% - 94% = 6%), then the charge when Maria went out to the park would be 28% - 6% = 22%.  The answer is 22%. 
[EXP] 1014: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 20% of 10000 is 10000 x 0. 20 = 2000.  Janet wants to save 2000 dollars.  There are two parts to her income: her wages and her tips.  Her wages are 40 hours a week x 10 dollars an hour = 400 dollars a week.  Her tips are 40 hours a week x 15 dollars an hour = 600 dollars a week.  So her total income is 400 + 600 = 1000 dollars a week.  She has to save 2000 dollars.  If she saves x weeks worth of income, then 1000x = 2000.  x = 2000/1000 = 2.  Janet needs to work 2 weeks to save the down payment.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1015: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  To find out how much money Jamaar has spent, we need to calculate the cost of the fruit he has purchased:

3 peaches at $. 5 each = 3 x $.  5 = $1.  5

4 pears at $.  5 each = 4 x $.  5 = $2

2 kiwis at $1 each = 2 x $1 = $2

5 apples at $. 75 each = 5 x $.  75 = $3.  75.  Then, total he has spent $1.   5 + $2 + $2 + $3.  75.  That is a total of $9.  He has 10 - 9 = $1 left.  Now, each plum cost $.  25.  We can find out how many plums he can buy by dividing the $1 he has left by the cost of a plum: $1 ÷ $.  25 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 1016: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]: 15 packs * 60 pieces per pack = 900 total pieces of sweets. 2 packs were kept, so 900 - 120 = 780 pieces were given to her friends. 780 pieces for 10 friends means 780 / 10 = 78 sweets each.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 1017: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 138, [output]: 5% of 120 = 0. 05 * 120 = 6. 120 + 6 = 126.  This is the price after 1st year.  Now the price is $126.  Again, 5% of this is added (0. 05 * 126 = 6. 3).  The new price is 126 + 6 = 132.  After 2 years, the price was  $132.  Again, 5% is added (0. 05 * 132 = 6.  6).  The new price is 132 + 6 = 138.   After 3 years, the price would be $138.  Rounded to the nearest integer, the price is $138.  The answer is 138. 
[EXP] 1018: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 45, [output]: 72 pictures were uploaded in total.  These pictures were divided into 8 albums.  Each album had the same number of pics.  So, each album held 72 / 8 = 9 pictures.  There are 8 albums in total, so she had 8 x 9 = 72 pics total.  This means there were 72 pictures.  There were 3 albums with selfies and 2 with portraits.  So, number of selfies pic = 3 * 9 = 27 and number of portraits = 2 * 9 = 18.  Hence, there are 18 portrait and 27 selfies.  The answer is 18 portraits and 27 selfies. 
[EXP] 1019: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 18 pages of the book is equal to 18 ÷ 3 = 6 groups of 3 pages. 6 groups will take 6 x 10 = 60 minutes.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 1020: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 98, [output]:  On a busy Saturday morning, there were 100 guests.  24 guests checked out early.  This left 100 - 24 = 76 guests.  Then 15 guests stayed on, so there were 76 + 15 = 91 guests.  After that, twice as many guests checked in as those who opted for a late checkout (15), so 15 x 2 = 30 guests checked in.  This made 91 + 30 = 121 guests.  After dinner, 7 more guests arrived.  So the hotel now has 121 + 7 = 128 guests.  The answer is 128. 
[EXP] 1021: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  John picks 4 bananas on Wednesday.  He picks 6 bananas on Thursday. 1n Friday, he picks triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday.  So that's 3 * 4 = 12 bananas.  So in total, John picks 4 + 6 + 12 = 22 bananas.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 1022: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]: 40% of 60 questions are easy.  That's 40/100 * 60 = 24 easy questions.  The rest are average and difficult.  60 - 24 is 36 questions.  These questions are equally divided into average and difficult, so 36/2 = 18 can be considered as average and 18 as difficult. 

Aries can get 75% of the 24 easy questions, which is 24 * 3/4 = 18.  She can also get half of the average and difficult questions.   Half of 18 (average) is 9.  Half of 18 (difficult) is also 9.  Adding these up, she gets 18 + 9 + 9 = 36 points.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 1023: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: panels.  Let's figure out the cost of the small and large stuffed animals.  If Teresa sells one small stuffed animal for 4 dollars, then each large stuffed animal is 3 x 4 dollars = 12 dollars.  She sold 2 times as many small stuffed animals as large ones.   Let's call the number of large stuffed animals 'x'.   Then the number of small stuffed animals she sold is 2x.  Since she sold a total of 120 dollars worth of stuffed animals, we have:

Small stuffed animals: 2x * 4 = 8x
Large stuffed animals: x * 12 = 12x

The total is the sum of these two:
8x + 12x = 20x

The equation is 20x = 120.  To solve for x, we divide both sides by 20.  20x / 20 = 120 / 20
x = 6

x is 6, so the number of large stuffed animals she sold was 6.  The number of small stuffed animals she sold is twice that, which is 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 1024: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 77, [output]: 1 week has 7 days.  For each day, the man eats 5 sandwiches, the wife eats 4 sandwiches, and the son eats 2 sandwiches.  So, in total, they eat 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches per day.  Multiply that by 7 days in a week, we get 7 x 11 = 77 sandwiches.  The answer is 77. 
[EXP] 1025: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Suzanne had some money left from selling cookies and cupcakes before giving money to her sisters.  Let's solve the problem step by step.  First, let's calculate her earnings from selling cookies and cupcakes.  She sold 80 cookies for 1 dollar each, which is 80 x 1 = 80 dollars.  She sold 60 cupcakes for 4 dollars each, which is 60 x 4 = 240 dollars.  So her total earnings are 80 + 240 = 320 dollars.   She gave her sisters 10 dollars each, which is 2 x 10 = 20 dollars.  So she spent 20 dollars from her earnings.  Now, let's calculate how much money she has left.  She had 320 dollars and spent 20 dollars, so she has 320 - 20 dollars left.   320 - 20 is 300.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 1026: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 100 eggs were originally hidden. 2 twins each found 30 eggs, so that's 2 x 30 = 60 eggs.  That leaves 100 - 60 = 40 eggs. 10 of these eggs were not found by the friends, so the remaining eggs found by the friends are 40 - 10 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 1027: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 43200, [output]: 12 pounds of ore per day for each dwarf with bare hands. 2 times that is 24 pounds per day with an iron pickaxe. 50% more than the iron pickaxe would be a 50% increase of 24 pounds, which is 36 pounds per day with a steel pickaxe. 36 pounds per day per dwarf. 40 dwarves with a steel pickaxe can mine 36 * 40 = 1440 pounds per day. 1440 pounds per day for 30 days is 1440 * 30 = 43200 pounds.  The answer is 43200. 
[EXP] 1028: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's analyze the given information:

* Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
* Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6

We can see that the price of the package doubles when the number of sandwiches doubles.  If this pattern continues, the price for the package with 8 sandwiches will be twice the price of the package with 4 sandwiches:

$6 (package 2) x 2 = $12

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.  The answer is $12. 
[EXP] 1029: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Tom buys a bedroom set for 3000 dollars.  Then he gets 1000 dollars from selling his old bedroom.  So now he has 3000 - 1000 = 2000 dollars to pay for the bedroom set.  Now the remaining 2000 dollars is paid off 10% a month.  10% of 2000 is 10/100 x 2000 = 200.   So Tom has to pay 200 dollars per month.  The answer is 200. 
[EXP] 1030: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Sally started with 25 red balloons, 7 green balloons, and 12 yellow balloons.  40% of the red balloons burst, so 0. 4 x 25 = 10 red balloons popped.  She had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.  She accidentally released half of the yellow balloons, so she released 12 / 2 = 6 yellow balloons.  She had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.   She found 8 blue balloons and 75% of 8 is 6, so she added 6 blue balloons.  Now she has 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue balloons.  In total, she has 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34 balloons.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 1031: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 24, [output]: 100 - 50 - (40 * 50) - (20 * 40 * 50) = 80%

Explanation:

* There's a 50% chance (1/2) that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. 
* If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance (2/5) she'll give everyone an extension.  So, the chance that she won't give an extension is 60% (1 - 2/5 = 3/5). 
* If the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance (1/5) Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.  So, the chance that he can't get a personal extension is 80% (1 - 1/5 = 4/5). 
* Since the chances are independent, we multiply the probabilities together:
	- (1/2) * (3/5) * (4/5) = 6/10 = 60%
* The chance that Marcus won't get an extension is 60%, so the chance that he'll actually have to turn in his homework is 100% - 60% = 40%.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 1032: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 6000 people can attend the Fine Arts Center. 950 seats are reserved for graduates and 300 seats for faculty.  So, 950 + 300 = 1250 seats are already taken. 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats are available for the rest of the guests.  Each graduate will receive a certain number of tickets.  Let's say x is the number of tickets each graduate will receive.  Since there are 950 graduates, the total number of tickets they can give out is 950 * x.  This must be equal to the remaining available seats, 4750.   So we set up the equation 950x = 4750.   To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 950, which gives us x = 5.  So each graduate will receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1033: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 450, [output]: 75 large jelly beans are needed to fill Grandpa up. 2 times as many medium beans are eaten than large beans, so 2 x 75 = 150 medium beans are eaten.  3 small beans equal 1 medium bean, so each medium bean is equivalent to 3 small beans. 150 medium beans is equivalent to 3 x 150 = 450 small beans.  The answer is 450. 
[EXP] 1034: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Melissa was summoned to jury duty for 3 days. 6 hours each day means she spent 6 * 3 = 18 hours listening to the court case.  She was paid 15 dollars per day, and she had to pay 3 dollars per day for parking.  In total, she got 15 * 3 = 45 dollars paid, but spent 3 * 3 = 9 dollars on parking.  So she really got 45 - 9 = 36 dollars.  She listened for 18 hours, so she made 36 / 18 = 2 dollars per hour.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1035: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 66, [output]:  Ted starts with $200. 3 books for 16 dollars each will be 3 x 16 = 48 dollars. 3 pencils for 6 dollars each will be 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.  In total, he spent 48 + 18 = 66 dollars.  The answer is 66.

If it takes 5 seconds to go from one soda bottle to the next, then dropping the candy and setting off a fountain of diet soda will take 5 seconds each.  For 8 soda fountains, it will take 5 * 8 = 40 seconds.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 1037: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 40 apples in one box times 2 boxes is 40 * 2 = 80 apples. 8 apples in one pack. 80 apples divided by 8 apples per pack is 80 / 8 = 10 packs. 10 packs in total.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 1038: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Amor started with 50 dollars.  She bought 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese at 11 dollars per pound.  That will be 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.  She bought 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese at 6 dollars per pound.  That will be 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.   So in total, Amor spent 22 + 18 = 40 dollars.  After spending 40 dollars, Amor will have 50 - 40 = 10 dollars left to buy meat.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 1039: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  Before college, Jim earned 25,000 dollars a year.  

Since he went to college for 4 years, he lost 4 * 25,000 = 100,000 dollars.  Now let's consider his loan.   In 4 years, he got 4 * 50,000 = 200,000 dollars in loans.   So, in total, he lost 100,000 + 200,000 = 300,000 dollars.   After college, he earns 25,000 * 3 = 75,000 dollars.   He has to earn 300,000 dollars to cover his loss.  So we have to solve 75,000 * x = 300,000.    Divide both sides by 75,000 and we get x = 4.    The answer is 4 years. 
[EXP] 1040: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]: 6 feet by 8 feet is the dimensions of the bed, which is 6 x 8 = 48 square feet. 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider means the fabric is 6 + 2 * 2 = 10 feet long and 8 + 2 * 2 = 12 feet wide. 10 x 12 = 120 square feet.  The answer is 120 - 48 = 72. 
[EXP] 1041: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 736, [output]: 425 letters were delivered on monday. 425 * 1/5 = 85, so 17 more than 85 were delivered on tuesday.  85 + 17 = 102.  On wednesday, they delivered 5 more than twice the amount delivered on tuesday. 102 * 2 = 204, and 204 + 5 = 209.  425 + 102 + 209 = 736.  The answer is 736. 
[EXP] 1042: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 101, [output]: 10 people want chicken salad. 6 people want pasta salad.  Let's add those costs:
Chicken salad: 10 x 6. 50 = 65 dollars
Pasta salad: 6 x 6 = 36 dollars
Total cost: 65 + 36 = 101 dollars.  The answer is 101 dollars. 
[EXP] 1043: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  First we find out how much was lost on the first race.  Lost $5.   Then on the second race he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.   He lost $5.  Twice of that is $10.   One more is $11.   So on the second race he won $11.   On the third race, he lost 1. 5 times as much as he won in the second race.   He won $11.  1. 5 times that is $16. 5.    So he lost $16. 5 on the third race.    We need the total loss.  He lost $5.  $11, and $16.  5.    Adding that together gives us $32. 5.  We have to divide this by 3 to find out what he lost on average.  $32.  5 / 3 = $10. 
[EXP] 1044: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130000, [output]:  There are 26 countries in South America.  In each country, there are 5 cities with 1000 people living in each city.  So, in each country there are 5 x 1000 = 5000 people.  Since there are 26 countries, the total number of people living in these cities is 26 x 5000 = 130000.  The answer is 130000. 
[EXP] 1045: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  First, we need to find the height of Xavier now.  Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches.  Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 feet = 48 inches.  Adding 3 more inches to this, Xavier is now 51 inches tall. 

  Next, we find Cole's height now.  Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches.  50 + 2 = 52 inches.  

  To find the difference between Cole's height and Xavier's height, we subtract Xavier's height from Cole's.  52 - 51 = 1.  The answer is 1 inch. 
[EXP] 1046: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 420, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that the second person took $80 more than the first person.  So, if the share of the first person is x, the share of the second person is x + 80.  The third person took twice what the second person took, so they took 2(x + 80) = 2x + 160.  The sum of these three amounts is $1920.  So, we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920

Combine like terms:

4x + 240 = 1920

Subtract 240 from both sides:

4x = 1680

Divide by 4:

x = 420

So, the share of the first person is $420.  The answer is 420. 
[EXP] 1047: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 189, [output]: 3 weeks is 21 days.  Each day, the team worked 3/8ths of a day, which is 3/8 * 24 = 9 hours.  Since there are 4 painters, the total hours worked per day is 9 * 4 = 36.  For 21 days, the total hours worked is 36 * 21 = 756.   So each painter worked 756 / 4 = 189 hours in total.  The answer is 189. 
[EXP] 1048: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's start with the second set.  We'll call the number of balls retrieved in the second set "x".  In the first set, we know Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set, so he retrieved "x + 4" balls.  And in the third set, we know he retrieved half as many as in the second set, so he retrieved "x/2" balls. 

We know that the total number of balls he retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation: 

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

First, let's combine like terms:

3x/2 + 4 = 19

Then, let's subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 15

Next, let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 30

Finally, let's divide both sides by 3:

x = 10

So, the number of balls retrieved in the second set is 10.  In the first set, he retrieved 4 more balls than that, so he retrieved 10 + 4 = 14 balls.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 1049: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7400, [output]:  This problem is the same type as the previous, where a quantity keeps changing each year.  The car started at 20000 dollars.  It then depreciates by a certain percentage each year.  

In this case, it depreciates 21% per year.   To calculate 21% of 20000 dollars, we can rewrite it as 20000 * (21/100) = 4200.  

So, the car's value is reduced by 4200 dollars in the first year.   This leaves 20000 - 4200 = 15800.  

In the second year, the car will depreciate another 21%.  We calculate 15800 * (21/100) = 3322.  Now subtract 3322 from 15800: 15800 - 3322 = 12478. 

The third year, the car will depreciate another 21%.   We calculate 12478 * (21/100) = 2608.  Now subtract 2608 from 12478: 12478 - 2608 = 9860.  

This gives the price of the car in the year 2010.  The answer is 9860.

[EXP] 1053: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]: 120 people were originally on the train.  At the first stop, 20 more boarded the train.  So now there are 120 + 20 = 140 people.  At the second stop, 50 people descended and twice that number boarded, so 2 * 50 = 100 boarded.  So the total now is 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.   At the final stop, 80 people descended.   So in total, there are 190 - 80 = 110 people on the train.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 1054: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 55, [output]:  First, we find the cost of the tank top. 10 dollars.  

Next, we find the cost of the running shorts.  It cost 5 more dollars than the tank top.   So 5 more dollars than 10 dollars.  10 + 5 = 15.  The cost of the running shorts is 15 dollars.  The tank top was 10, and the shorts were 15.  10 + 15 = 25.   The tank top and running shorts cost 25 dollars.   The tennis shoes cost half price of the original 48 dollars.  The original cost was 48, but it was half off.   So we divide the original 48 by 2 to get the final cost.   48 / 2 = 24.   The cost of the tennis shoes is 24 dollars.   So far we have spent 25 dollars on the top and shorts, and 24 dollars on the shoes.   25 + 24 = 49.  Next, there were athletic socks for 8 dollars, but with a 2 dollar coupon.  To find the final cost of the socks, we subtract the discount from the original cost. 8 - 2 = 6.  The final cost of the socks is 6 dollars.    We still have the original total of 49 dollars from the top, shorts, and shoes.  Finally, we add the cost of the socks to the total.  49 + 6 = 55.  Alison spent 55 dollars on athletic gear. 
[EXP] 1055: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]: 1 foot on each side of a square means the area of each tile is 1 * 1 = 1 sqft.  So to find out how many tiles you need, you divide the total area by the area of the tile. 200 sqft / 1 sqft per tile = 200 tiles.  Each tile costs $12, so 200 tiles will cost 200 x 12 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 1056: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2304, [output]: 60% more than 120 dollars is an increase of (60/100) * 120 = 72 dollars. 120 + 72 = 192. 192 dollars a month for a year is 192 * 12 = 2304 dollars.  The answer is 2304.

[EXP] 1061: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* There are 4 pizzas with 8 slices each, so in total, there are 4 x 8 = 32 slices. 
* Becky ate 10 slices.  Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did, Jake ate 10 - 3 = 7 slices.  
* Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so Silvia ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices.  To find the total number of slices they ate, we can add up the slices eaten by each of them: 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.  They ate 31 out of the 32 slices.  It seems they left 1 slice uneaten.  However, this question only asks how many slices they ate, so the answer is 31. 
[EXP] 1062: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 58, [output]:  Betsy and Donovan made the meal together.  If the meal took 98 minutes, Donovan's part took some amount of time, and then Betsy's part took 18 minutes more.  Let's call Donovan's part x.  Then Betsy's part would be x + 18.  The total time was 98, so it can be represented as x + (x + 18) = 98.  Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98.  Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80.  Divide both sides by 2: x = 40.   Betsy's part took 18 minutes more, so that means Betsy's part was x + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.  The answer is 58. 
[EXP] 1063: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 482, [output]:  Hannah starts by paying for the cast.  The cast cost $200.  Next, they pay for the doctor's visit.  The doctor's visit costs $300/hour for 30 minutes, which is the same as 1/2 hour.  1/2 hour x $300/hour is $150.  Next, they pay for the painkillers.   The painkillers cost $4 each, and there were 30 of them.   So they pay $4 x 30 = $120 for the painkillers.   Finally, they pay for parking.   Parking costs $6/hour and there is a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking.  So they have to pay for 2 hours of parking.   2 hours x $6/hour = $12.  In total, Hannah pays $200 for the cast, $150 for the doctor's visit, $120 for the painkillers, and $12 for parking.  $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482.  The answer is 482. 
[EXP] 1064: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 320, [output]: 80 emails per day.  James doesn't respond to 20% of those emails. 20% of 80 is 20/100 * 80 = 16. 80 - 16 = 64 emails that James responds to.  In a 5 day work week, James is going to respond to 64 emails a day * 5 days = 64 * 5 = 320.  The answer is 320. 
[EXP] 1065: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 247, [output]: 32 classes visited on Monday, then 2 times that many visited on Tuesday (2 x 32 = 64), and 3 times that many visited on Wednesday (3 x 32 = 96). 32 + 64 + 96 = 192 classes visited from Monday to Wednesday. 192 + 30 classes that visited on Thursday = 222 classes. 222 + 25 that visited on Friday = 247 classes. 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.  The answer is 247. 
[EXP] 1066: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 95, [output]: 100 is the score on the first 3 tests. 100 is the average for those tests, so 100 * 3 = 300. 80 is the score for the 4th test. 300 + 80 = 380.  The sum of the scores is 380.  Since there are 4 tests, we divide by 4: 380 / 4 = 95.  John's average score is 95.  The answer is 95. 
[EXP] 1067: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 20 pizzas were ordered by the glee club and they ate 70% of them. 20 x 70/100 = 14 pizzas.  So there are 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas left for the glee club. 

The football team ordered twice as many pizzas as the glee club, so they ordered 20 x 2 = 40 pizzas.  They ate 80% of them.  40 x 80/100 = 32 pizzas.  So, 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas are left for the football team.  In total, 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas are left.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 1068: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 245, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many big coupons Anthony is sending.  He's sending out 700 small coupons and twice as many big coupons.  Since 700 is the small coupon amount, the big coupon amount is 700 x 2 = 1400.  Total, Anthony is sending 1400 + 700 = 2100 coupons.  The small coupons cost 5 cents each, so that's 700 x 5 = 3500 cents for the small coupons.   The big coupons cost 15 cents each, so that's 1400 x 15 = 21000 cents for the big coupons.   Total, the postage cost is 3500 + 21000 = 24500 cents.  Since there are 100 cents in 1 dollar, this is 24500 / 100 = 245 dollars.  The answer is 245. 
[EXP] 1069: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 24, [output]:  One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.  Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which is 10 - 3 = 7.  Since each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, Sidney ordered a total of 7 x 4 = 28 meatballs.  Mark ate 4 sub sandwiches, which is 4 x 4 = 16 meatballs.  So 28 - 16 meatballs remain.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 1070: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]: 20 trucks were dispatched.  Two hours later, a quarter of the trucks could not deliver fertiliser.  A quarter of 20 is 20 / 4 = 5.  So 5 trucks could not deliver.   That leaves 20 - 5 = 15 trucks.   If each of them were carrying 20 tons, the total amount of fertiliser delivered is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 1071: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]: 1 pound of butter is needed for each dozen croissants, and 6 dozen croissants need to be made.  So 6 pounds of butter are needed in total. 

The promotion is "buy one pound of butter get one half off".  This means that for every full pound of butter, you get half a pound free.  So for 6 pounds of butter, 3 pounds are full-priced and 3 pounds are half-priced. 

Full-priced butter is 4 dollars, so 3 full-priced pounds cost 4 x 3 = 12 dollars.  Half-priced butter is 4/2 = 2 dollars, so 3 half-priced pounds cost 2 x 3 = 6 dollars.  

So the total cost of the 6 pounds of butter will be 12 dollars for the 3 full-priced pounds plus 6 dollars for the 3 half-priced pounds.  12 + 6 = 18 dollars.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 1072: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]:  First, let's figure out how many people will be attending the party. 25 classmates, 7 dance classmates, and 13 family members adds up to 25 + 7 + 13 = 45.  However, 4 people said they cannot come, so that leaves 45 - 4 = 41 people.  The party fee is for 20 people plus 6 dollars for each additional guest, so for 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests, that is 21 x 6 = 126.  So the total cost is 125 + 126 = 251.  The answer is 251. 
[EXP] 1073: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 85, [output]:  Maggie and Riza each had $60.  Maggie spent a quarter of her money.  A quarter of 60 is 60 / 4 = 15.  So Maggie has 60 - 15 = 45 dollars left.  Riza spent one-third of her money.  One-third of 60 is 60 / 3 = 20.   So Riza has 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left.   Together, they have 45 + 40 = 85 dollars left.  The answer is 85. 
[EXP] 1074: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]: 315 bananas are meant for a week, so a day's worth of bananas is 315 / 7 = 45 bananas. 1 monkey eats 10 bananas each day. 1 monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first, so the second monkey eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas.  The 3 monkeys together eat 10 + 14 + ? (third monkey) = 45 bananas.  10 + 14 = 24. 45 - 24 = 21.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 1075: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 750, [output]:  Teddy started with half of a 500 piece puzzle. 500 / 2 is 250.  Then he completed two 500 piece puzzles.  So in total, he placed 250 + 500 + 500 = 1250 puzzle pieces.  The answer is 1250. 
[EXP] 1076: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Jenny's original amount of money is 5 * 5 = 25 dollars.  She bought 15 roses.  A dozen roses for 15 dollars will be 1 dozen for 15 and 3 more roses at 2 dollars each for 2 * 3 = 6 dollars.  So in total, she spent 15 + 6 = 21 dollars.   After spending 21 dollars, she is left with 25 - 21 = 4 dollars.   Since she was going to be given only quarters for change, we need to convert this 4 dollars to quarters.   There are 25 cents in a quarter.  4 dollars * 100 cents/dollar = 400 cents.  400 cents / 25 cents/quarter = 16 quarters.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 1077: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 162, [output]: 1. 6 milkshakes for $5. 50 each means 6 x 5. 50 = 33 dollars.  9 burger platters for $11 each means 9 x 11 = 99 dollars.  20 sodas for $1. 50 each means 20 x 1. 50 = 30 dollars.  In total, Terry makes 33 + 99 + 30 dollars.  33 + 99 is 132.  132 + 30 = 162.   The answer is 162. 
[EXP] 1078: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 145, [output]:  Let's start by finding the arrival time for each train:

1.  First train arrives in 10 minutes, and stays for 20 minutes, so it will leave the station at 30 minutes.  The second train arrives 30 minutes after the first train leaves, so it will arrive at 60 minutes. 
2.   The second train stays for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed.  The first train stayed for 20 minutes, so the second train will stay for 5 minutes.  It will leave the station at 65 minutes. 
3.  The third train will arrive 60 minutes after the second train leaves the station.  The second train left at 65 minutes, so the third train will arrive at 125 minutes.  
4.   The third train will leave the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 125 minutes.  
5.   The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.   The third train left at 125 minutes, so the fourth train will arrive at 145 minutes.  This is the train Paul will board. 

Since the trains will be arriving and leaving at these intervals, Paul will need to wait 145 - 10 = 135 minutes for his train.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 1079: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie had 10 toothpicks every week for the past 12 weeks. 10 * 12 = 120 toothpicks.  She already has 120 toothpicks. 200 - 120 = 80.  So she has 80 toothpicks left to save.  For each week, she gets 10 toothpicks. 80 / 10 = 8.  It will take her 8 more weeks to save 80 toothpicks, which completes the 200 toothpicks needed.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 1080: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 75% of $2000 is 0. 75 * 2000 = $1500.  So Mr.  Rogers bought the watch for $1500.  He then sells it to his friend for 120% of that price, which is 1. 2 * 1500 = $1800.   Since Mr.  Rogers had to pay $1500, his friend received a discount on the original price of $2000.   The discount is $2000 - $1800 = $200.  To find the percentage discount, we can divide the discount by the original price and multiply by 100.  ($200 / $2000) * 100 = 10%.  The answer is 10%. 
[EXP] 1081: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72000, [output]: 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 4 hours is 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds. 

Each spring creates a jellyfish every second.  5 springs will create 5 jellyfish every second.  14400 seconds is 14400 * 5 = 72000 jellyfish.  The answer is 72000. 
[EXP] 1082: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 195, [output]:  Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score.  Binkie's score is 90.  Twice as high as that is 2 x 90 = 180.   Add 15 to that, to get 180 + 15 = 195.  The answer is 195. 
[EXP] 1083: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  James has to walk to the store, and then back home.  So the total distance he is walking is 4 x 2 = 8 miles.  He walks 4 miles per hour.  To solve this problem, we need to find out how many hours it takes James to walk 8 miles.  To do this, we divide 8 by 4.   8 / 4 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1084: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 10 bunches for 4 bananas each is 10 x 4 = 40 bananas.  The cost of the bananas would be individual sales: 40 x $0. 80 = $32.  But the cost of the bunches is 10 x $3. 00 = $30.  The difference in cost is $32 - $30 = $2.  So she saved $2.  The answer is $2. 
[EXP] 1085: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 100 feet of fence needs to be split between Sam and Harry.  Harry will get 60 feet more than Sam.  Let's call the amount Sam gets x.  Then the amount Harry gets is x + 60.  Since they need to add up to 100, we can make the equation:  x + (x + 60) = 100.  Combining like terms, we get:  2x + 60 = 100.  Subtracting 60 from both sides, we get:  2x = 40.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get:  x = 20.   Now we know that Sam gets 20 feet of fence and Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence.  The total amount of fence left over for Sam is 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1086: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years.  To determine how many inches it grows per year, we need to divide 8 by 4. 8 divided by 4 is 2.  So the crocodile grows 2 inches per year.  To find out how many inches it will grow in 13 years, we can multiply the number of inches it grows per year by the number of years.  2 x 13 = 26.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 1087: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 131250, [output]: 15% of 300 bikes is 0. 15 x 300 = 45.  So 45 bikes were BMX.  Half of the total (300) is 150.  So 150 bikes were Trekking.  The rest (300 - 45 - 150) are MTB.  300 - 45 - 150 = 105.  

Now let's calculate the total revenue.  For Trekking, 150 x 450 = 67500.  For BMX, 45 x 250 (half price of MTB, which is $500) = 11250.  For MTB, 105 x 500 = 52500.  The total revenue = 67500 + 11250 + 52500 = 131250.  The answer is 131250. 
[EXP] 1088: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 6 hours pass and the farmer makes 5 x 6 = 30 bales. 6 hours pass and the truck picks up 3 x 6 = 18 bales. 30 - 18 = 12 bales are left in the field.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 1089: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 6 periods per day means John attends 6 classes.  He takes 2 extra classes, so in total he attends 6 + 2 = 8 classes.  Each class is 40 minutes, so he spends 8 * 40 = 320 minutes in class each day. 

He goes to class for 5 days a week.  So, he spends 320 * 5 = 1600 minutes in class each week.   Then, on Saturday and Sunday, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes as extra learning time.  1600 minutes per week / 16 = 100 minutes per day.  Therefore, he spends 100 minutes on Saturday and 100 minutes on Sunday as extra learning time. 

In total, he spends 1600 minutes in class and 100 + 100 = 200 minutes on Saturday and Sunday.   So, his weekly learning time in minutes is 1600 + 200 = 1800 minutes.    Since 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour, we convert 1800 minutes to hours by 1800 / 60 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 1090: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  The problem states that the ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce.  Since it is dropped from the 3rd floor, its initial height is 3 x 24 = 72 feet.  On its first bounce, it will reach 2/3 x 72 = 48 feet.  Now it will bounce again.  Since it bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height again, the new height will be 2/3 x 48 = 32 feet.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 1091: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Let's start by converting the height of the first child from feet to inches: 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches.  Since the second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, the second child is 72 + 2 = 74 inches tall.  The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so the third child is 74 - 5 = 69 inches tall.   The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so the fourth child is 69 + 3 = 72 inches tall.  The problem asked how tall the fourth child is in inches, and the answer is 72 inches. 
[EXP] 1092: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1000, [output]:  The orchard sells apples in bags of 10.  To find out how many bags of apples were sold, we can divide the total number of apples (2000) by the number of apples per bag (10). 2000/10 = 200.  So, there were 200 bags of apples sold.  Each bag costs $5, so the orchard earned 200 x $5 = $1000.  The answer is 1000. 
[EXP] 1093: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1.  The T-Rex ate half of the small triceratops.  Let's call the initial weight of the triceratops x kilograms.  The T-Rex ate x/2 kilograms.   What's left is x - x/2 = x/2 kilograms.  The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, so they ate x/4 kilograms.   This left  x/2 - x/4 = x/4 kilograms.   The Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, so we can set up the equation x/4 = 270 to solve for x.  Multiplying both sides by 4, we get x = 1080.  The answer is 1080. 
[EXP] 1094: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]:  First, we need to calculate the total area of the four walls.  The north and south walls are 10 x 8 feet each, so that's 80 + 80 = 160 square feet.  The east and west walls are 5 x 8 feet each, so that's 40 + 40 = 80 square feet.   So the total area of the four walls is 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.  Each gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet, so we need 240 / 20 = 12 gallons of paint.  Since each gallon costs $12, the total cost will be 12 x 12 = $144.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 1095: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Since Ellen shook up 3 sodas, there are 3 shaken sodas and 9 unshaken sodas.  Ellen took 1 unshaken soda, so there are 8 unshaken sodas left.  Ellen's brother took 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, so there are 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas left.   Now, if Ellen's friend takes 1 soda, the probability she is taking a shaken soda is 2/8 = 25%.  To express this as a percentage, we need to multiply it by 100, which gives us 25.  The answer is 25%. 
[EXP] 1096: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 270, [output]:  Since one train is traveling at 60 miles per hour, and the other train is traveling half that distance at 30 miles per hour, the distance between them is increasing at a rate of 60 + 30 = 90 miles per hour. 

After 3 hours, they will be 90 x 3 = 270 miles apart.  The answer is 270. 
[EXP] 1097: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Billy volunteers 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.  So he helps 2 x 3 = 6 people per day.  March has 31 days, but he takes 20% of the days off.   20% of 31 is 6 days.   So he works 31 - 6 = 25 days in March.  In April, he works the entire month, so that's 30 days.  In total, he works 25 + 30 = 55 days.   In a day, he helps 6 people.  So over 55 days, he helps 6 * 55 = 330 people.  The answer is 330. 
[EXP] 1098: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 480, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total number of people in the buses.  There were 12 buses and each carried 35 people.  So the total number of people in the buses is 12 x 35 = 420. 

Next, let's calculate the total number of people in the private cars.  There were 20 cars and each carried 3 people.  So the total number of people in the cars is 20 x 3 = 60.  The total number of people inside the church is the sum of the people in the buses and the cars, which is 420 + 60 = 480.  The answer is 480. 
[EXP] 1099: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  First, we find out how old Martha is. 24 - 4 = 20.  Martha is 20 years old.  Then we know Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. 20 + 10 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 1100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  We first find how long it takes to ride the biggest slide. 300 feet at 60 feet/minute will take 300 / 60 = 5 minutes. 

We then find how long it takes to ride the second biggest slide. 240 feet at 80 feet/minute will take 240 / 80 = 3 minutes. 

To find how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest. 5 - 3 is 2 minutes.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 30 minutes for lunch and 2*15 = 30 minutes for breaks, so in total Bobby takes 30 + 30 = 60 minutes = 1 hour per day.  After 5 days, he took 1 hour * 5 days = 5 hours of breaks and lunch.  The answer is 5 hours. 
[EXP] 1102: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's find how many miles Micah ran first.  Since Micah ran 3. 5 times what Amber ran, and Amber ran 8 miles, Micah ran 8 * 3.  5 = 24 miles.  Now, we know Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 24 miles.  To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract 8 + 24 from the total of 52.  52 - (8 + 24) = 52 - 32 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1103: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 113, [output]:  Sheila started with an initial balance of 85.  Then she returned an item that cost her 15, so her new balance would be 85 - 15 = 70.  Then she bought the frying pan that was 20% off 20, so it costs 20 - 20% of 20 = 20 - 4 = 16.  The set of towels that was 10% off 30 costs 30 - 10% of 30 = 30 - 3 = 27.  The total cost of these new purchases is 16 + 27 = 43.  So, she adds this to her new balance of 70 and gets 70 + 43 = 113.  The answer is 113. 
[EXP] 1104: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  A fifth of the jellyfish are large.  Let's call the total number of jellyfish x.  So, the number of large jellyfish is x/5. 

2.   A third of the large jellyfish change color.  So, 1/3 of x/5 (or x/15) jellyfish change color.  The number of large jellyfish that change color is x/15.  They change from green to blue.  Others are small and always stay blue.  So, the number of jellyfish that change color is x/15.  However, the problem tells us that 6 jellyfish changed color.   So, x/15 = 6.  

3.  We can solve for x (number of jellyfish) by multiplying both sides by 15.   x = 6 * 15 = 90.   The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 1105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Caroline is 3 times older than Ben, so if Chris is 4, then Ben is 4 x 2 = 8.  If Ben is 8, Caroline is 8 x 3 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 1106: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 20% of $100,000 is $20,000.  So Lauren saves $20,000 per year. 20 years of retirement savings requires $20,000 * 20 = $400,000.  It will take 400,000 / 20,000 = 20 years to save 400,000.  But Lauren will only have enough money to live on a salary of 40% of $100,000 = $40,000.  So Lauren will need to continue working and saving  in addition to 20 years.  The answer is more than 20. 
[EXP] 1107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 100 cm is being divided into 4 equal parts. 100 / 4 = 25.  So each of the 4 parts is 25 cm.  Each of these parts must be further divided into 5 equal parts.  25 / 5 = 5.   The answer is 5 cm. 
[EXP] 1108: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 240 is 40% of a school population. 100% is 240 / 0. 4 = 600.  So there are 600 students in the school. 240 are boys.  The rest are girls.  600 - 240 = 360.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 1109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]: 19 + 26 = 45.  Then, she has 7 dollars off.  45 - 7 = 38.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 1110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 3 women have 4 inch heels, so they have a total of 3 * 4 = 12 inches of heels. 3 women have 2 inch heels, so they have a total of 3 * 2 = 6 inches of heels. 12 + 6 = 18, and so there are 18 inches of heels total. 18 inches of heels is an average of 18 / 6 = 3 inches per woman.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 1111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 9,300 miles need to be covered in the month of June.  Soledad will be hiking twice a day, which is a total of 125 * 2 = 250 miles per day. 9,300 / 30 (days in June) = 310.  So Soledad needs to hike 310 miles each day, but is only hiking 250.  310 - 250 is 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 1112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 157, [output]:  Let's calculate the total number of balls. 3 red balls + 11 blue balls + 25 green balls = 39 balls.  Now, the cost of a red ball is 9 dollars, cost of a blue ball is 5 dollars, and cost of a green ball is 3 dollars.   So, if all the balls are sold, the store will receive: 

Red balls: 3 x 9 = 27 dollars
Blue balls: 11 x 5 = 55 dollars
Green balls: 25 x 3 = 75 dollars

Total amount received: 27 + 55 + 75 = 157 dollars

The answer is 157. 
[EXP] 1113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 12 kg were originally purchased.  Peter wants a quarter (1/4) of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/4 = 3 kg.  Paul wants 1/3 of 12 kg, which is 12 * 1/3 = 4 kg.  Together, they want 3 + 4 = 7 kg.  12 - 7 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: -3, [output]: 2 degrees Celsius initially.  It dropped 8 degrees overnight, so it became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.  Then it increased 3 degrees Celsius in the morning, so it became -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius.  The answer is -3. 
[EXP] 1115: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Raymond started with 21 dollars.  He saved 11 dollars so he has 21 + 11 = 32 dollars.

[EXP] 1116: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 5, [output]: 16 dollars were in Anna's budget. 4 dollars were already spent, so 16 - 4 = 12 is the amount left in her budget.  12 is also the amount Anna has after buying 2 books.  So 12 dollars was spent on two books, and each book must have cost 12 / 2 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 1117: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 20% of 50 students is 20/100 * 50 = 10 more students. 50 students + 10 more students = 60 students. 60 students are enrolled this year.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 1118: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Logical thinking is needed here!

First, we need to find the number of times the light blinks per minute. 255 times is the amount of blinks in 5 minutes, so we can find the rate per minute by dividing 255 by 5:

255 ÷ 5 = 51

This means the light blinks 51 times per minute.  Now, we need to find the number of minutes it will take to blink 459 times.  We can do this by dividing 459 by the rate per minute (51):

459 ÷ 51 = 9

So, the light will take 9 minutes to blink 459 times.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 1119: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  We will find the total number of male fishes and the total number of female fishes. 

Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8

Total male fishes: 6 + 5 = 11
Total female fishes: 8 + 8 = 16

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of female fishes and the number of male fishes: 
16 - 11 = 5.  Tat has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Let's start by figuring out how long it took Megan to walk the dog.  Since it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia to complete her chore, it took Megan 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.  Now, let's figure out how long it took Dior to do the laundry.  Since it took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia, it took her at least 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do the laundry, but it could be more.  Since we aren't given a specific time, we'll say it took her at least 8 hours. 

To find the total time they all took to do their chores, we'll add up their times.   It took Amalia 4 hours to mow the lawn.   It took Megan 6 hours to walk the dog.   It took Dior at least 8 hours to do the laundry.  Adding these up, we get 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours.  So they took at least 18 hours to do their chores altogether.  The answer is at least 18. 
[EXP] 1121: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 560, [output]:  First, calculate the distance traveled per trip:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 70 mph x 2 hours
Distance = 140 miles

Since he visits his parents twice a month, the total distance traveled per month is:

Total Distance = 2 x 140 miles
Total Distance = 280 miles

The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 1122: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  If Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day, then she will walk a total of 10 x 7 = 70 miles in 7 days.  Since Brian will walk half as much as Sofie, Brian will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles.  The answer is 35. 
[EXP] 1123: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]: 2 workers produce 6 toys each, so they produce 6 + 6 = 12 toys in an hour. 2 other workers produce 4 toys each, so they produce 4 + 4 = 8 toys in an hour.  In total, all 4 workers produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys per hour.  Since they worked for 10 hours, they produced 20 x 10 = 200 toys.  The manufacturer still needs 20 more toys to fulfill the order.  So the total number of toys they made in 10 hours is 400 - 20 = 380.  380 toys in 10 hours means they made 380 / 10 = 38 toys per hour.  But the 4 workers made 200 toys in 10 hours, which means the remaining 5th worker made 380 - 200 = 180 toys in 10 hours.  So the 5th worker produced 180 / 10 = 18 toys per hour.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 1124: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 105, [output]:  Let's start by finding the weight of Elijah's dogs.  One of his dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog:
(1/4)*60=15 pounds
The other dog is half the weight of Kory's dog:
(1/2)*60=30 pounds
In total, Elijah has 15 + 30 = 45 pounds of dogs. 
Elijah and Kory's dogs weigh together:
60 + 45 = 105 pounds
The answer is 105. 
[EXP] 1125: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.  Luis used half of his stickers and gave the rest, so he must have kept half of what Seth gave him and given the other half to Kris.  Let's call the number of stickers Seth started with x.  Then, Luis kept 1/2x and gave the other 1/2x to Kris.  Kris kept 9 and gave the remaining 1/2x - 9 to Rob.   But 1/2x - 9 is the remaining piece, so it must equal 7.  1/2x - 9 = 7.   We need to get x alone, so we add 9 to both sides: 1/2x - 9 + 9 = 7 + 9.  1/2x = 16.  Now multiply both sides by 2: x = 32.  Seth had 32 stickers originally.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 1126: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 1 large bag weighs 10 ounces and contains 10 x 30 = 300 M&M's. 3 large bags would be 3 x 300 = 900 M&M's.  Each small bag contains 10 M&M's.  So, the number of small bags he can make is 900 / 10 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 1127: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Alfie flies 400 km per day.  The distance to be covered is half of the way around the earth, so 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 km.  To cover this distance, we need to divide 20,000 by 400.  20,000 / 400 is 50.  So it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 1128: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car.  The average car can go 120 miles per hour.   So the 2nd fastest car can go 5 times that: 5 * 120 = 600 miles per hour.  

The fastest car is 1. 25 times the speed of the 2nd fastest car.  The 2nd fastest car can go 600 miles per hour.  So the fastest car can go 600 * 1. 25 = 750 miles per hour.   

The answer is 750. 
[EXP] 1129: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 2 years ago, Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.  At that time, his age was twice the age of Vince.  So Vince was 14 / 2 = 7 years old.  Now, Vince is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 1130: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.  Let's call it x.  Since they both painted the same number, the total eggs Arnold and Madeline painted is 2x.  And since Arnold, Madeline, Camden, and Sarah painted a total of 56 eggs, then:
2x + 30 = 56
2x = 56 - 30
2x = 26
x = 13

So Arnold and Madeline painted 13 eggs each.  Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, so Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, and let's call Sarah's number of eggs y, then:
Camden's eggs = y + 12
Since Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs, then:
y + (y + 12) = 30
2y + 12 = 30
2y = 30 - 12
2y = 18
y = 9

So Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.  Arnold painted 13 eggs.   To find out how many more Camden painted than Arnold, we subtract:
21 - 13 = 8

The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 1131: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Nik has 200 crayons and he wants to put them in groups of 8.  To find how many groups of 8 crayons there are, we divide 200 by 8.  200 / 8 = 25.  So there will be 25 groups of 8 crayons each.  Since each group of 8 crayons will be in a box, there will be 25 boxes total. 

Each crayon weighs 1 ounce, so 8 crayons weigh 8 ounces.  And since there are 25 groups of 8 crayons, they will weigh 25 x 8 = 200 ounces. 

Each box weighs 8 ounces, and there are 25 boxes.  So the total weight of the boxes is 25 x 8 = 200 ounces.  But we are not finished yet!  The crayons and the boxes will be put together in a shipment.   So we need to add the weight of the crayons (200 ounces) to the weight of the boxes (200 ounces).  This gives us a total weight of 400 ounces. 

Now we need to convert the weight from ounces to pounds.  Since there are 16 ounces to a pound, we divide 400 by 16 to find the number of pounds.  400 / 16 = 25.   So the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 1132: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 96, [output]: 80% of 80 is the same as saying 80 * 0. 8 = 64.  So John had 64 feet of useable lumber. 

He cut it into 4-foot logs, so there are 64 / 4 = 16 logs. 

From each of those logs, he cuts 5 planks.  So he cuts 16 * 5 = 80 planks.  He sells each for $1. 2, so the total he makes is 80 * $1. 2 = $96.  The answer is $96. 
[EXP] 1133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45000, [output]:  Valerie earns 5000 per month.  Her brother earns twice as much as her.  So her brother earns 2 x 5000 = 10000.  The total they earn together is 5000 + 10000 = 15000.   Their mother earns 2 times as much as they do combined.  So she earns 2 x 15000 = 30000.  The total amount they all have together is 15000 + 30000 = 45000.  The answer is 45000. 
[EXP] 1134: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step-by-step!

1.  Grandma walks 3 miles total, with 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.  So she spends 2/3 of her time walking on the beach and 1/3 on the sidewalk. 
2.  She takes 40 minutes to walk on the beach.   Since this is 2/3 of her time, the total time spent walking is 40 * (3/2) = 60 minutes.  So she has 20 minutes left to walk on the sidewalk. 
3.  On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.  So it will take her half as much time to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk as it takes her to walk 1 mile on the beach.  Since she has 20 minutes left, that means it will take her 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.   So it will take her 10 minutes to walk the entire 1 mile on the sidewalk. 
4.  So in total, Grandma takes 60 minutes to walk the 2 miles on the beach and 10 minutes to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.   The total time to walk the entire 3 miles is 60 + 10 = 70 minutes.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 1135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Jane has 4 * 8 = 32 dollars saved so far. 60 - 32 = 28.  It will take 28 / 4 = 7 more weeks to save another 28 dollars.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 1136: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 3 trees each had 7 blue birds. 7 * 3 = 21.  2 trees had 4 blue birds.  4 * 2 = 8.  Add the blue birds from the first set of trees and the second set: 21 + 8 = 29.  There was one more tree with 3 blue birds. 29 + 3 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 1137: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Bob has a certain number of marbles, but we don't know how many.  If he receives 2 dozen more, 2 * 12 = 24 marbles, and he will have 60 marbles.  So he must have started with 60 - 24 = 36 marbles. 

After losing 10 marbles, he will have 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 1138: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Donny's water bottle started with 2 mugs of water.  One mug was 33 degrees.  The other mug was x degrees.  He poured 4 ounces from the 33-degree mug, and 1 ounce from the other mug.   This means that the water bottle currently has a degree between 33 and 40 degrees, and we want the minimum possible degree. 

After pouring, we can set up an equation:  (33 - 4) + (x - 1) >= 40. 

Simplifying the equation, we get:  29 + (x - 1) >= 40.  Subtracting 29 from both sides gives:  x - 1 >= 11. 

Adding 1 to both sides gives:  x >= 12.  So the minimum possible degree of the second mug is at least 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 1139: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]: 50 cows were originally on the farm. 3 weeks is 21 days. 20 cows per day from Milkie Cows Limited is 20 x 21 = 420 cows. 50 original cows + 420 cows = 470 cows. 20 chickens were originally on the farm. 10 chickens per day from Broilers Limited is 10 x 21 = 210 chickens.  20 original chickens + 210 chickens = 230 chickens.  470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.  The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 1140: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 4 packs of bagels for 10 dollars each is 4 x 10 = 40 dollars.  With a 10% discount, he gets 10% off of 40 which is 4 dollars.  So the total cost is 40 - 4 = 36.  Since each pack has 9 bagels, he receives 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.  To find the cost of each bagel, we divide the total cost by the total number of bagels.  36 / 36 is 1.  So each bagel will cost 1 dollar.  The answer is 1 dollar. 
[EXP] 1141: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 27, [output]:  First, we need to find out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate.  He ate 5 less than 23 scoops.  So, we subtract 5 from 23 to get 23 - 5 = 18.  Gomer ate 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.  Now, to find out how many potatoes he ate, we need to find out how many potatoes it takes to make one scoop of mashed potatoes.   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.   This means it takes 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.   If it takes 3 potatoes to make 3 scoops, it must be that it takes 3 potatoes to make 1 scoop.  Now, we know it takes 3 potatoes to make 1 scoop and Gomer ate 18 scoops.    So, he ate 3 * 18 = 54 potatoes.  The answer is 54. 
[EXP] 1142: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Chester started by eating 3 eggs a day for 30 days, which is 30 * 3 = 90 eggs.  Then he started eating 5 eggs a day for 30 days, which is 30 * 5 = 150 eggs.  In total, he ate 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  A dozen eggs is 12 eggs.  So we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get 240 / 12 = 20 dozens.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1143: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 17 green jelly beans and twice as many red jelly beans means 2 * 17 = 34 red jelly beans. 17 + 34 = 51 non-blue jelly beans. 60 total jelly beans minus 51 non-blue jelly beans means 60 - 51 = 9 blue jelly beans.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 1144: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Tim grows 5 trees and each year he collects 6 lemons from each tree.  So each year, Tim gets 5 x 6 = 30 lemons.  A decade is 10 years.  So in 10 years, Tim will get 30 lemons per year * 10 years = 300 lemons.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 1145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 20 women alight from the bus, so the remaining number of women can be found by subtracting 20 from the original number of women. 

Let's first find the number of men and women on the bus:

The ratio of men to women is 5:9, so the number of men can be represented as 5x and the number of women as 9x.  The total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 9x = 84

Combine like terms:

14x = 84

Divide both sides by 14:

x = 6

Now that we know x, we can find the number of men and women on the bus:

Number of men = 5x = 5(6) = 30
Number of women = 9x = 9(6) = 54

Originally, there were 54 women on the bus.  After 20 women alight, the number of remaining women can be found by subtracting 20 from 54:

54 - 20 = 34

The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 1146: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 291, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

1.  Faraday earns $26 from the sunflower.  Since each sunflower costs $2, he sells 26/2 = 13 sunflowers. 
2.   He earns $56 from the bouquet.   Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so each bouquet costs 8.   To find how many bouquets he sold, divide 56 by 8: 56/8 = 7.   Since each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers in the bouquets sold is 7 * 12 = 84.  Add this to the 13 sunflowers sold separately to find the total number of sunflowers: 13 + 84 = 97.  The answer is 97. 
[EXP] 1147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Adam starts with 100 dollars.  He can buy rocks for 5 dollars and sell them for 7 dollars.  So his profit for each rock is 7 - 5 = 2 dollars.  We first need to find out how many rocks Adam buys.  He invests all his money, so he spends the 100 dollars.  He buys rocks for 5 dollars each, so 100 / 5 = 20 rocks.  Adam sells 60% of his inventory, which means he sells 60% * 20 = 12 rocks.  He sells 12 rocks for 7 dollars each, which is 12 * 7 = 84 dollars.  His total revenue is 84 dollars.  His total cost is the money he spent buying the rocks, which is 20 * 5 = 100 dollars.   He makes a loss, since his revenue is less than his cost.  His loss is the difference between his cost and his revenue.  100 - 84 is 16.  The answer is 16.

It would take her 9 days to draw 45 large-sized picture scenes.  She has to create 36 medium-sized picture scenes.  She can do 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day. 36 / 6 = 6.  It would take her 6 days to draw 36 medium-sized picture scenes.  She has to create 49 small-sized picture scenes.   She can do 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.  49 / 7 = 7.  It would take her 7 days to draw 49 small-sized picture scenes.   She will need 9 + 6 + 7 = 22 days to create all of the picture scenes.  The answer is 22.

[EXP] 1152: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  First, we need to find the total distance traveled. 110 + 140 is 250.  Sid traveled 250 miles in total, which took 2 + 3 hours = 5 hours.  To find the average speed, we divide the total distance by the total hours.  250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 1153: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  First, we need to find the probability of the second ticket winning.  Let's call this probability x%.  Then we know that the probability of the first ticket winning is 20%.  We know that the second ticket is 3 times more likely to win, so the second ticket's probability (x%) is 3 times the first ticket's probability (20%).  This means x% = 20% * 3 = 60%. 

Now we can find the joint probability.   The first ticket winning and the second ticket winning must both happen.   We find this probability by multiplying the two probabilities together: 20% * 60% = 12%.  This is the probability that both tickets are winners. 

The answer is expressed as a percentage, so we convert the result to a percent: 12% * 100 = 12. 
[EXP] 1154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's start by using the fact that Carlos collected 5 less than Jim.  So, if Jim collected 27 seashells, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22.  Since Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, if we let the number of seashells Carrey collected be x, we can set up the equation 22 = 2x.  To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get x = 11.  So, Carrey collected 11 seashells.  In total, they collected 27 + 22 + 11 = 60 seashells.  Since they divided the seashells equally, each person got 60/3 = 20 seashells.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 5 weekdays with 4 carrots each is 4 x 5 = 20 carrots.  2 days on the weekend with 5 carrots each is 5 x 2 = 10 carrots. 20 + 10 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 1156: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  The second song is 60% longer than the first song.  To find the time of the second song, we need to add 60% of the time of the first song. 60% of 5 minutes is 3 minutes, so the second song is 5 + 3 = 8 minutes.  The total time of the cassette is the sum of the two songs: 5 minutes + 8 minutes = 13 minutes.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 1157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's first find the total amount Linus paid for the devices on Monday and Tuesday.  He bought 2 devices on Monday, and 4 devices on Tuesday, for a total of 6 devices.  He paid 20 dollars for each device, so he paid a total of 20 x 6 = 120 dollars for the devices.  Let's then consider the total amount Linus got from selling the devices.  He sells each device for 2 x 20 = 40 dollars, so for 6 devices he got 40 x 6 = 240 dollars.  The total profit that Linus earned is the amount he got from selling the devices minus the amount he paid for the devices.  So, 240 - 120 is 120.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 1158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Because Isabel is 7 feet tall, Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall.  Because Carl is 1 foot taller than his brother Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, his cane is 6 feet / 2 = 3 feet long.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 1159: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7300, [output]: 2300 people have their daily energy needs.  Each bottle can cover 20% of energy demand.  So for each person, they need 100% / 20% = 5 bottles.  For 2300 people, that's 5 * 2300 = 11500 bottles.  But originally Hortex can produce 4200 bottles.  To make 11500, they need 11500 - 4200 = 7300 more bottles.  The answer is 7300. 
[EXP] 1160: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]: 8 babies were born, 1/4 of them are wearing blue. 1/4 x 8 = 2 babies are wearing blue.  3/4 x 8 = 6 babies are wearing purple.  And 1/3 of the purple wearers are also wearing bows.  That is 2/3 x 6 = 4 babies wearing bows that wear purple.  Of the total number of babies wearing bows which is 2 plus 4, 4 babies wear purple.  So what is the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is: (4 / 6) * 100% = 67%.  The answer is 67%. 
[EXP] 1161: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1125, [output]: 5168 tax reports were received last week. 1907 reports were received on Monday and Tuesday, and 2136 reports were received on Thursday and Friday.  We can find the total number of reports received on these days by summing them up: 1907 + 2136 = 4043.  Subtracting this from 5168 gives us the number of reports received on Wednesday: 5168 - 4043 = 1125.  The answer is 1125. 
[EXP] 1162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 170, [output]: 80 square meters of unused land.  First, he sold half of them for $50, so he sold 80 / 2 = 40 square meters.  He is left with 80 - 40 = 40 square meters.  Then he sold 1/4 of the remaining land for $30, which is 40 / 4 = 10 square meters.  He is left with 40 - 10 = 30 square meters.  He sold the remaining 30 square meters at $3 per square meter.  30 * 3 = 90 dollars.  Then he earned 50 dollars from selling the first half, 30 dollars from selling the second quarter, and 90 dollars from selling the last part. 50 + 30 + 90 = 170 dollars.  The answer is 170. 
[EXP] 1163: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 1st step is to determine how old Geb will be if he is 10 less than half of Haley's age.  This means that Geb's age = (Haley's age / 2) - 10.  Haley is 26 years old.  Geb's age = (26 / 2) - 10 = 13 - 10 = 3.  Geb is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 1164: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Tyrion changes his face mask 2 times when he goes out.  He goes out 3 times a day, so he uses 2 x 3 = 6 face masks per day.  In 2 days, he will use 6 x 2 = 12 face masks.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 1165: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  We can solve this problem by first finding the number of eggs each person finds and then subtracting the total number of eggs found from the original number of eggs.  Cole hid 3 dozen eggs, which is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  Stacy finds twice as many eggs as Lamar, so she finds 5 x 2 = 10 eggs.  Charlie finds 2 less eggs than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.  Mei finds half as many eggs as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.  The total number of eggs found is 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.  So, 36 - 27 = 9 eggs are still hidden in the yard.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 1166: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1248, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step! 

There are 3 apartment complexes.  The first two have 200 apartments each.  To find the total number of apartments in these two, we do 200 + 200 = 400. 

The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.   First, let's find the other two combined: 400.   To find 60% of this number, we do 0. 6 x 400 = 240.  This is the amount of increase needed.   So, we add that to the total of the first two:  400 + 240 = 640.    This is the total number of apartments in the third complex. 

John collects garbage 3 times a week from each place.   So, we first need to find the total number of collections per week.    There are 3 apartment complexes and he makes 3 collections per week per complex.  So, he makes 3 x 3 = 9 collections per week. 

Now, he gets paid $. 40 per apartment.     There are a total of 200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 apartments.    He makes 9 collections per week.    So, in total, he collects (1040 x $. 40) x 9 = 3744.  The answer is 3744. 
[EXP] 1167: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2350, [output]: 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount, so 50 x 3 = 150.  7-year-old produces 7 times the initial amount, so 50 x 7 = 350.  An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than 10-year-old one, which will be 10 times the initial amount later.  So 50 x 10 - 200 = 450.  As it doesn't produce anything in the 9th year, no fruits produced.  In the 10th year, it produces 20 times the initial amount, 50 x 20 = 1000.  Total fruits is 50 + 150 + 350 + 450 + 0 + 1000 = 1900.  The answer is 1900. 
[EXP] 1168: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Jack started with $100.  Sophia gave him 1/5 of her $100. 1/5 of 100 is 20.  Jack now has 100 + 20 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 1169: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that the blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.  Let the length of the yellow rope be y.   Then the length of the blue rope is y - 7. 

The problem also states that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope.  So the length of the red rope is 4 * (y - 7).  Finally, the problem tells us that the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.   Equating this to the total length of the three ropes, we get:

y + (y - 7) + 4 * (y - 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

2y - 7 + 4y - 28 = 37

Combine like terms again:

6y - 35 = 37

Add 35 to both sides:

6y = 72

Divide by 6:

y = 12

So the yellow rope is 12 centimeters long.  The blue rope is 12 - 7 = 5 centimeters long, and the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, which is 5 * 4 = 20 centimeters long.  The red rope is 20 centimeters long.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1170: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ronnie and Rissa were given some money initially.  Ronnie was given $5.  Rissa was given 3 times as much as Ronnie, so Rissa was given 3 * 5 = 15.  After they both gave some money to their little sister, they each have some left.  Rissa has 4/5 of her money left.  So Rissa gave 1/5 of her money.  1/5 of 15 is 3.  So Ronnie also gave 3 dollars to their little sister.  Originally, Ronnie had 5 dollars.  After giving 3 dollars, he had 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1171: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's say the amount of red, white, and purple paint is x.  Since there are equal amounts, it means that x = x = x.  Also, the amount of yellow paint is half the total color, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.  So the total amount of paint used is: x + x + x + 6 = 12. 

Combine like terms: 3x + 6 = 12.  Subtract 6 from both sides: 3x = 6.  Divide both sides by 3: x = 2. 

So, the amount of red paint used would be 2 pints.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3160, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  There are 4 bedrooms, and each bedroom is 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.  So the area of all 4 bedrooms is 4 x 240 = 960 square feet.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, which means it is 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.  Currently, we have accounted for the bedrooms' area and the living room's area.   To find the total area of the house, we add these together:  960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.  The answer is 3160. 
[EXP] 1173: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 93, [output]:  Alice saw 3 puffs of clouds on monday. 3 x 2 = 6 clouds on tuesday, then 6 x 2 = 12 on wednesday, then 12 x 2 = 24 on thursday, and finally 24 x 2 = 48 clouds on friday. 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 is 93.  The answer is 93. 
[EXP] 1174: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  The regular box has 100 pods.  A new box has 20% more pods than 100.   20% of 100 is 20.   100 + 20 is 120 pods.   So the new box has 120 pods.  A box of 120 pods costs the same as 1 box of 100 pods, so its cost is $12.   The cost per pod in the new box is $\frac{12}{120}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{10}$.  If you use 1 pod per cycle, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles per dollar.  So the answer is 10. 
[EXP] 1175: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Thomas starts with 1000 USD in 20 dollar bills.  He has 1000 / 20 = 50 bills initially.  He loses 10, leaving him with 50 - 10 = 40.  After using half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill, he has used 40 / 2 = 20 bills.  So he has 40 - 20 = 20 bills left.  He triples his money, so he now has 20 * 3 = 60 bills.  Finally, converting all his bills to 5 dollar bills, he has 60 / 4 = 15 five-dollar bills.   The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 1176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:

1.  Team A scores 4 goals in the first half.  Team B scores 2 fewer than A, which is 4 - 2 = 2 goals. 

2.   So, the score at halftime is:
   -  Team A: 4
   -  Team B: 2

3.  In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the goals scored by team B.    Since team B scored 2 goals in the first half, it scores 2 x 4 = 8 goals in the second half.  So team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals.  The total goals scored by team A is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6.  The total goals scored by team B is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10.  Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 1177: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 5-inch is the original length of the chalk.  20% of 5 inches is . 20 x 5 = 1 inch.  This is how much chalk the teacher aims to use per day.  But on Monday, the teacher used 45% of the chalk, which is . 45 x 5 = 2. 25 inches.   So the chalk is (5 - 2. 25) = 2. 75 inches long now.  The teacher will use 20% of the chalk per day.  20% of 2. 75 inches is . 20 x 2.  75 = 0. 5 inches.    Since the chalk gets shorter at a rate of 0. 5 inches per day, for it to get shorter to 2 inches, which is when the teacher likes to recycle it, we do the following:   begin{align*}
\frac{2. 75 - 2}{0.   5} &= x \\
\frac{0.   75}{0.  5} &= x \\
x &= \frac{3}{2} = 1.  5  \textrm{ days}
\end{align*}  The teacher has 1. 5 days left before he needs to recycle this piece of chalk.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 1178: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]: 12 boys and 12 girls make a total of 12 + 12 = 24 students. 1/3 of the girls are on varsity, so 12 * 1/3 = 4 girls are on varsity. 1/4 of the boys are on varsity, so 12 * 1/4 = 3 boys are on varsity. 4 girls and 3 boys make 4 + 3 = 7 students who are on varsity. 24 students total minus the students on varsity is 24 - 7 = 17 students who are not on varsity.  The answer is 17.

[EXP] 1180: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 1st, we calculate how many teeth were either drilled or capped. 

James drills 4 teeth.  He caps 7 more teeth than he drills, so he caps 4 + 7 = 11 teeth. 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.  15 is out of 30 teeth, so the percentage the dentist fixed is (15/30) x 100%. 15/30 simplifies to 1/2, so the answer is (1/2) x 100% = 50%. 
[EXP] 1181: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 5600, [output]: 2/5 of the 4000 gallons of milk are expired, so we need to find what 2/5 of 4000 is, and then multiply it by the cost per gallon to get the total refund. 

2/5 of 4000 is 4000 x 2/5 = 800.  So, 800 gallons of milk were expired.  

The cost of those 800 gallons is 800 x $3. 5 = $2400.  

The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 1182: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  

Wendy is 5 times as old as Colin will be 7 years from now, so let's denote Colin's current age as C. 7 years from now, his age will be C+7.   

Wendy is 5 times (C+7), so she is 5C+35.  In 25 years, Colin's age will be C+25, and Wendy's age will be her current age + 25.   According to the problem, C+25 is a third of Wendy's age now, so Wendy's age now is 3(C+25).   We know Wendy's age now is 5C+35, according to the previous sentence.  So, we can set 5C+35 equal to 3(C+25), solve for C, then find the answer. 
[EXP] 1183: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1800, [output]:  Bob spent 27000 dollars on books. 100 books cost 500 dollars, so 27000 dollars will buy 27000 / 500 = 54 sets of 100 books. 54 sets of 100 books will be 54 x 100 = 5400 books. 

Since he distributed the money across 3 schools, to find out how many books he can buy per school, we divide 5400 by 3. 5400 / 3 = 1800.  The answer is 1800. 
[EXP] 1184: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. 

Newton picked up the 2 apples and put 1 in his pocket.  That leaves 1 apple.  He threw the other apple into the tree, causing 5 more apples to fall out. 

Now, there are 1 + 5 = 6 apples.  Newton put all but 1 in his pocket.  It means he put 5 apples in his pocket, and left 1 apple. 

The remaining 1 apple was thrown into the tree, causing 6 more apples to fall out.  

So, now, there are 1 (from the 1 apple that was left) + 6 = 7 apples.   Newton picked up all of those apples and went home.   That means he brought 7 apples home.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 1185: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 306, [output]: 850 kilos of coal need to be bought. 850 divided by 50 is 17, because 50 x 17 = 850. 17 coal bags will be purchased. 17 coal bags at $18 per bag will cost 17 x 18 = 306.  The answer is 306. 
[EXP] 1186: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 6 friends eat 6 slices each of cheese pizza, and 6 x 6 = 36 slices.  6 friends eat 4 slices each of pepperoni pizza, and 6 x 4 = 24 slices.  So a total of 36 + 24 = 60 slices are eaten. 

The cheese pizza is cut into 12 slices, so they need 36 / 12 = 3 cheese pizzas.  The pepperoni pizza is cut into 8 slices, so they need 24 / 8 = 3 pepperoni pizzas.  The total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy is 3 + 3 = 6.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 1188: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Jay starts with an empty snowball collection.  He can build 20 snowballs in an hour.  So for every hour, he will have 20 more snowballs.  However, 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes.  There are 4 15 minute periods in an hour, so 8 snowballs melt every hour.   So for every hour, he gains 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs.  Jay wants 60 snowballs, and he already has none.  He needs 60.  60 divided by 12 is 5 with a remainder of 0.  So it will take 5 hours for Jay to have 60 snowballs.  It will take him 5 hours to have 60 snowballs.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 20 years ago, Digimon came out. 20 years ago, Digimon had no anniversary.  Now Digimon had its 20th anniversary.  So 20 years must have passed. 

John was twice as old as Jim then.  Let's find John's age 20 years ago.  John is now 28, so 20 years ago, he was 28 - 20 = 8. 

Since John was twice as old as Jim, Jim was 8/2 = 4 years old 20 years ago. 

To find Jim's current age, add 20 to his age 20 years ago: 4 + 20 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 1190: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

Doxa ate 1 slice.  Her sister ate 1 more than her, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices.  Her brother ate 1 more than her sister, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices. 

In total, they ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices of apple.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 1191: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 78 bandages were left at the end of the third day.  

On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.  Since they only used half a pack, they used 25 bandages on the third day.  So, they had 78 + 25 = 103 bandages after ordering the two bulk packs. 

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day.  38 - 10 = 28 bandages.  So, on the second day, they used 28 bandages.  

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack.  So they already had some bandages.  

Let's call the number of bandages they had initially x.  

After using 38 bandages, they would have had x - 38 bandages.  The next day, they used 28 bandages.  So, they still had x - 38 - 28 = x - 66 bandages.   

After ordering one bulk pack of 50 bandages, they would have had x - 66 + 50 = x - 16 bandages.  And this is the number of bandages they used on the third day, 78, when they had some bandages left.    So, we know that x - 16 = 78.   Solving this equation gives us x = 94.  So, the answer is 94.

- Emptying the dishwasher: $0.  50 for each time, so for 6 times, he earns 6 * $0.  50 = $3.  00

So, in a two-week period, Jason did his laundry once, cleaned his room once, took the trash out twice, and emptied the dishwasher 6 times.  To find the total amount of money he earned, add the earnings for each task:

$3. 00 (laundry) + $1. 50 (cleaning room) + $1. 50 (taking trash) + $3. 00 (emptying dishwasher) = $9. 00.  The answer is $9. 
[EXP] 1195: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1200, [output]: 40 gallons of blood per whale.  A shark has 3 times as much blood as a whale, so a shark has 3 x 40 = 120 gallons of blood.  If there are 10 sharks, they in total have 10 x 120 = 1200 gallons of blood.  The answer is 1200. 
[EXP] 1196: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 320, [output]: 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.  Then 40 more entered, making it 50 + 40 = 90 people.  Then 2 times the number who entered at 10:00 enter, which is 2 x 40 = 80 people.  So at this point, we have 90 + 80 = 170 people.  Finally, 3 times as many people as the first group entered, which means 3 x 50 = 150.  Adding this to the total, we get 170 + 150 = 320.  The answer is 320. 
[EXP] 1197: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens, so she has 5 * 5 = 25 red pens.  She also bought twice as many black pens, so she has 2 * 5 = 10 packs of black pens.  There are 10 * 5 = 50 black pens.  In total, Alain has 25 + 50 = 75 pens.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 1198: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  John buys 10 bottles of scotch for 600 dollars.  That means each scotch cost $600 / 10 = $60.  He buys twice as many cognacs as scotch.   So he buys 10 * 2 = 20 cognacs.   Since the cognacs cost 50% more than the scotch, 50% of 60 = 30, so each cognac costs $60 + 30 = $90.  So the total he spends on cognacs is 20 * 90 = 1800.  In total, he spends $600 on scotch and $1800 on cognacs.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 1199: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 140, [output]:  Let's start by finding the number of Lodgepole Pine trees planted on the first day.  Since Mr.  Julius planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine as White Oak trees, and he planted 20 White Oak trees, he planted 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees on the first day.  Next, on the second day, he planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than he planted on the first day.   On the first day, he planted 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.   1/4 of 40 is 10.   So on the second day, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.   On the first day, he planted 20 White Oak trees.   On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, so he planted a total of 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.  Now, find the total number of trees planted by Mr.  Julius in both days.  The total number of White Oak trees is 20 + 30 = 50.    The total number of Lodgepole Pine trees is 40 + 50 = 90.  The total number of trees planted is 50 + 90 = 140.  The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 1200: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 24 gallons were made. 4 gallons were drunk, so 24 - 4 = 20 gallons were left.  7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons were left.  5 gallons were taken, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons were left.  The partygoers still have 8 gallons in total, and they will split it equally.  8 // 3 = 2 and a remainder of 2.  So each will have 2 gallons and 2 gallons left over will remain.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1201: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 8 more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40.  We can start by letting the number of coffee mugs be x.  Four times the number of coffee mugs is 4x.  Then, 8 more than that will be 4x + 8.  But we know that this equation equals 40.  So, we can say 4x + 8 = 40.  To find the value of x, we subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 4x = 40 - 8.  4x = 32.  Then, we can divide both sides by 4 to find the value of x: x = 32 / 4.  x = 8.   So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 1202: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]: 1/3 of the fish have red stripes. 1/3 of 66 = (1/3) * 66 = 22.  So 22 fish have red stripes.  After removing the 22 fish with red stripes, there are 66 - 22 = 44 fish left.  Then, 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. 5/11 of 44 = (5/11) * 44 = 20.  So 20 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.  In total, there are 22 + 20 = 42 fish with red or blue stripes.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 1203: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Amy had 2 palettes, each with 4 colors, so she had 2 x 4 = 8 colors. 3 makeup sets, each with 6 colors, so she had 3 x 6 = 18 colors.  In total, she had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.  Her sister stole one palette, so she has 26 - 4 = 22 colors left.  Then Amy used up half of the colors from one makeup set.  Since that makeup set has 6 colors, she used up 6 / 2 = 3 colors.  So now she has 22 - 3 = 19 eyeshadow colors.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 1204: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Mattison is 60 inches tall.  The two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so that is 60 * 7 = 420.   The floor to ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so that is 60 * 3 = 180.   The roof will be the remainder of the house's height after subtracting the first floor's height, which is 420 - 180 = 240.  The roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches high.  The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 1205: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 40% of the shells were found by Alphas. 40% of 700 is 40/100 x 700 = 280 shells.  That leaves 700 - 280 = 420 shells. 60% of the remaining shells were found by The Finders. 60% of 420 is 60/100 x 420 = 252 shells.  That leaves 420 - 252 = 168 shells.  Gogetters found the remaining 168 shells.  The answer is 168.

The third dog needs 3 miles.  On average, they need 3 miles per day.  First, the total distance the first three dogs need to walk is 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.  Since there are 4 dogs, the total distance needed is 4 * 3 = 12 miles.  The last dog needs 12 - 8 = 4 miles to walk.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 1207: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40,000, [output]:  John's house is worth 250,000 dollars.  The loan is 40% of that, so the loan amount is 40% * 250,000 = 100,000 dollars.  He uses 60% of the loan amount, which is 60% * 100,000 = 60,000 dollars.  The remaining amount he has is 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000 dollars.  The answer is 40,000. 
[EXP] 1208: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 64, [output]:  First, we need to find the total weight of tunas caught by Deandre:

3 tunas - 1st tuna: 56 kg
2nd tuna: 46 kg
3rd tuna: 26 kg
Total weight of tunas: 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kg

Second, we need to find the total amount earned by selling all the tunas:

Total weight of tunas: 128 kg
Cost per kilogram of tuna: $0. 50
Total amount earned: 128 kg * $0. 50 = $64

So Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas.  The answer is 64. 
[EXP] 1209: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]: 72 dollars is the cost. 11/8 of 72 will be the selling price, so let's do that calculation first:

11/8 x 72 = 99

So Trinity sells the magazines for 99 dollars. 99 is the selling price, and 72 was the cost, so we need to find the profit:

Profit = Selling price - Cost
= 99 - 72
= 27

The answer is 27 dollars. 
[EXP] 1210: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  Brian's dehumidifier has three settings: low, medium, and high.  On the low setting, it removes 1 liter per day.   On the medium setting, it removes 1 x 2 = 2 liters per day.   On the high setting, it removes 2 x 2 = 4 liters per day.  Brian ran the dehumidifier on the low setting for 3 days.  So, that is 1 x 3 = 3 liters.  He then ran it on the medium setting for 3 days.  So that is 2 x 3 = 6 liters.  Finally, he ran it on the high setting for 5 days.   So that is 4 x 5 = 20 liters.   In total, the dehumidifier removed 3 + 6 + 20 = 29 liters.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 1211: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 288, [output]:  They started with 10 packs of balloons, and each pack has 30 balloons.  So, they started with 10 * 30 = 300 balloons.  After the battle, there are 12 balloons left.  So, 300 - 12 = 288 balloons were thrown.  The answer is 288. 
[EXP] 1212: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 448, [output]: 14 mL is the amount of the first medicine. 3 times that amount of the second medicine will be 14 x 3 = 42. 14 + 42 = 56.  We are not asking how much medicine Saanvi needs in total, just for 1 dose.  That's 56 mL.  We want to find the total medicine Saanvi will need for 8 doses.  Since there is 56 mL of medicine in 1 dose, there will be 56 * 8 = 448 mL of medicine in 8 doses.  The answer is 448. 
[EXP] 1213: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Let's start by finding the capacity of John's classes.  Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali's class which has 120 students.   So, the capacity of each class is 1/8 * 120 = 15.  There are two classes, so the total capacity of John's school is 15 * 2 = 30.   Now we need to find the total capacity of both schools.  Ali's school has a capacity of 120.  John's school has a capacity of 30.   Together, they have 120 + 30 = 150.  The answer is 150. 
[EXP] 1214: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Stephen borrowed $300 and promised to return it with 2% additional. 2% of $300 is $6.  So Stephen will need to pay back $300 + $6 = $306.  He will pay $25 each month for 11 months, for a total of 11 x $25 = $275.  To pay off the remaining amount, including the interest, Stephen will need to pay $306 - $275.  $306 - $275 is $31.  The answer is $31. 
[EXP] 1215: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 2 children require 5 diaper changes per day each, so that is 2 x 5 = 10 diaper changes per day.  If Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, that means she changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.  Therefore, Jordan changes the remaining diaper changes, which is 10 - 5 = 5 diapers per day.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1216: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  First, let's find the volume of the jar in cubic inches.  The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height.   The length and width are 6 inches, so 6 * 6 is 36, and the height is 15, so 36 * 15 = 540 cubic inches.   Since they get about 80% efficiency in packing, this means they can pack about 80% of the volume with jelly beans.  80% of 540 is 432 cubic inches.  

Now we need to find out how many jelly beans there are in total.  Since a jelly bean is . 15 cubic inches, the total number of jelly beans is 432/. 15 = 2880 jelly beans.   Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, 30% x 2880 = 864 red jelly beans.   The true number of red jelly beans is 900.   To find how far off he was, we do 900 - 864 = 36.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 1217: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20 people were already on the bus.  40 people got on at the first stop.  So there were 20 + 40 = 60 people.  At the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered the bus at the first stop entered.  So 3/4 of 40 is 30.  So there were 60 + 30 = 90 people.  At the third station, the number of passengers doubled.   That means it increased to 2 x 90 = 180 people.  The bus can hold 200 people.   200 - 180 = 20 spaces are remaining.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1218: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 1.  Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year, so for 5 years, she made 3 x 5 = 15 visits.  For each visit at that time, the cost was 2 dollars.  So she spent 15 x 2 = 30 dollars. 

2.  After the 5 years, the cost of one visit increased by 150%.   That means the new cost is 2 + (2 x 1. 5) = 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.   Pauline still visits the museum 3 times a year, so that for 3 more years is 3 x 3 = 9 visits.  So she spent 9 x 5 = 45 dollars. 

3.  To find the total amount spent, we add what she spent in the first 5 years plus what she spent in the next 3 years.  So 30 + 45 = 75.  The answer is 75.

That is 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 students.  Since only 8 students can try the escape room at a time, it will take 40/8 groups. 40/8 is 5.   Each group takes 45 minutes, so it will take 45 * 5 = 225 minutes in total for everyone to try the escape room.  The answer is 225 minutes. 
[EXP] 1220: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  John manufactured 4 wooden tables for 20 dollars each, so that's 4 x 20 = 80 dollars worth of tables.  He also manufactured 2 roof frames for 10 dollars each, so that's 2 x 10 = 20 dollars worth of frames.  In total, Ali owes John 80 + 20 = 100 dollars.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 1221: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Let's start by letting the length of the shorter piece be x.  Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, its length can be represented as 4x.  We know that the total length of the original board is 40 feet, so we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 8

Now that we know the length of the shorter piece is 8 feet, we can find the length of the longer piece:

Longer piece = 4x = 4(8) = 32 feet

The answer is 32 feet.

[EXP] 1224: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 1. 16 minutes is charged at 25 cents per minute, so it will cost 16 x 25 = $4. 20 minutes are charged at 20 cents per minute, so it will cost 20 x 20 = $4.  36 - 16 = 20 minutes are charged at 20 cents per minute, so it will cost 20 x 20 = $4.  $4 + $4 is $8.  The answer is $8. 
[EXP] 1225: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 2 inches of rain on Monday.  Twice of Monday's total is 2 * 2 = 4. 1 more inch than that is 4 + 1 = 5 inches of rain on Tuesday.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1226: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's say x is the number of cupcakes Carly made.  Since she makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes, that means she made 3x - 2 brownies. 

Since each person gets 2 treats, the total number of treats is 2 x 5 = 10.  We know that the total number of treats is equal to the number of brownies plus the number of cupcakes, so we can set up the equation: 3x - 2 + x = 10. 

We can simplify the equation by combining like terms: 4x - 2 = 10.  To solve for x, we add 2 to both sides: 4x = 12.  Then we divide both sides by 4: x = 3.  

Since x is the number of cupcakes, Carly made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 1227: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  A basic manicure starts at 35 dollars.  A basic pedicure starts at 40 dollars.  So the total without the discount would be 35 + 40 = 75 dollars.  Since they offer a 20% discount for both, we need to calculate 20% of 75, which is 0. 20 * 75 = 15.  So, the discount is 15 dollars, and the real price for both manicure and pedicure is 75 - 15 = 60 dollars.  If she choses to add nail art on each of her fingers, and each nail art costs 3 dollars, then she would need to pay 3 * 10 = 30 dollars for nail art (assuming 10 fingers).   In total, she would pay 60 + 30 = 90 dollars.   The answer is 90.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf.   20 - 5 is 15.  So the number of books each shelf can hold is 10, 10, 20, 15.  The total number of books each shelf can hold is 10 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 55.   To hold 110 books, we will need 110 / 55 bookcases.  110 divided by 55 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1242: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 5 dozens of eggs, which is 5 x 12 = 60 eggs, cost $2. 40 a dozen, so the total cost is 5 x 2. 40 = $12.  60 eggs will be sold for $1 for 3 eggs, so that's 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs. 20 sets of 3 eggs at $1 per 3 eggs is 20 x 1 = $20.  To find the profit, subtract the cost from the revenue, 20 - 12 = 8.  The answer is $8. 
[EXP] 1243: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 1/2 of the hats are red, which means Skyler has 100 x (1/2) = 50 red hats.  Then, 100 - 50 = 50 hats are left. 3/5 of these remaining hats are blue, so Skyler has 50 x (3/5) = 30 blue hats.  This leaves 50 - 30 = 20 hats.  These are the white hats.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1244: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 1 bag for $18. 3 dollars off means the bag will be $15. 30 sticks cost 15 dollars. 15 divided by 30 is 50 cents per stick. 50 cents = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 1245: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  Audrey has to get 70% of the total questions correct.  If we find the number of questions she needs to get right, we can do that like this: 

First test: 70 questions.  She got 60% right.  To find out how many she got right, we multiply the total by the percentage: 70 * 0. 6 = 42.  So she got 42 questions right on the first test. 

The total number of questions is the number of questions on the first test plus the number of questions on the second test: 70 + 40 = 110 questions.  To get 70%, she needs: 110 * 0. 7 = 77 questions.  She got 42 on the first test, so she needs to get: 77 - 42 = 35 questions right on the second test.  The answer is 35. 
[EXP] 1246: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 96, [output]:  Let's start by using a variable to represent the number of strawberry cubes.  Let's say the number of strawberry cubes is x.  Then, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.   The total number of ice cubes is the sum of the strawberry cubes and the blueberry cubes, which is x + (5x - 4).  We know that this total is 116.  So, we can set up the equation x + (5x - 4) = 116 to solve for x.  The equation simplifies to 6x - 4 = 116.   We can solve for x by adding 4 to both sides of the equation, which gives us 6x = 120.  Then, we can divide both sides by 6 to get x = 20.  Since the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4, we can substitute x = 20 to get 5(20) - 4, which simplifies to 100 - 4, which is 96.  Therefore, the answer is 96. 
[EXP] 1247: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3360, [output]:  Ara plays 40 games every year, and she has been playing for four years. 40 * 4 = 160 games.  If her score for every game is 21 points, then the total score will be 160 * 21 = 3360 points.  The answer is 3360.

For every two customers that come into the car dealership, one will buy a car.  To get 15 cars, Jason will need 15 customers to come in.  To get 15 customers, Jason will need 30 customers to visit the car dealership (15 x 2).  To get 30 customers, Jason will need 750 telephone calls (30 x 25).  The answer is 750. 
[EXP] 1250: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 56, [output]: 8 rooms in the house. 4 people living there.  Each person has a flashlight, so that is 4 flashlights.  Each room has 2 flashlights, so that is 8 * 2 = 16 flashlights.  So in total there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.  Candles: half of the rooms have 4 small candles each.  4 small candles * 4 rooms = 16 small candles.   The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each.   5 medium candles * 4 rooms = 20 medium candles.   Total candles = 16 small + 20 medium = 36 candles.   Combining flashlights and candles, Brianna's family is using 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 light sources.  The answer is 56. 
[EXP] 1251: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  Mitchell bought 2 bags of chips, with 55 chips in each bag. 2 x 55 = 110 chips total. 110 chips divided between 5 people means each person gets 110 / 5 = 22 chips.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 1252: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 30, [output]: 5 minutes

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.  According to the problem, it takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube.  The second and third sides each take twice that long, so 2 x 5 minutes = 10 minutes.   Since it takes 10 minutes for each of the second and third sides, we add them together: 5 + 10 + 10 = 25 minutes. 

According to the problem, the last 2 sides each take half as long as the first.   The first side took 5 minutes, so half of 5 minutes is 5/2 = 2.  Since it takes each of the last two sides 2 minutes, and there are two of them, it will take 2 x 2 = 4 minutes.  

Adding up all the times, the total time is 25 + 4 = 29 minutes.  So it takes John 29 minutes to finish the Rubik's cube.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 1253: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  Since there were half as many robots as helmets, and half as many helmets as footballs, that means there were twice as many helmets as robots, so there were 20 / 2 = 10 robots.  And since there were half as many helmets as footballs, there were 20 * 2 = 40 footballs. 20 helmets, 10 robots, 40 footballs.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 1254: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Tim has 6 hours a day, which is 6 * 60 = 360 minutes.  If each call takes 15 minutes, then he can answer 360/15 = 24 calls a day. 
[EXP] 1255: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Louise will apply the coat of varnish to 6 paintings.  Normally, it would take 6 x 7 = 42 minutes for the varnish to dry.  With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes per painting.  For 6 paintings, it would take 6 x 12 = 72 minutes.   To find the difference in time, we find 72 - 42 = 30.  The answer is 30 minutes. 
[EXP] 1256: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 4 of Crista's plants need half a cup of water each, so that is 4 x 1/2 = 2 cups.  8 plants need 1 cup each, so that is 8 x 1 = 8 cups.  20 - (4 + 8) = 8 plants need a quarter of a cup each. 1/4 cups * 8 = 2 cups. 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 1257: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 200 yards is the distance from Phineas's home. 200/2 = 100, so 100 yards is on land and 100 yards is in water. 100 yards on land at 20 yards per minute is 100/20 = 5 minutes.  100 yards in water at 10 yards per minute is 100/10 = 10 minutes.  In total, it will take Phineas 5 + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to return home.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 1258: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 1 box of popsicle sticks is 8, and he needs 56 popsicle sticks in total, so he will need 56 / 8 = 7 boxes.  Each box costs 2 dollars, so 7 boxes will cost 7 x 2 = 14 dollars.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 1259: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  The main phone plan costs $20.  Each additional phone costs half of the main phone plan, which is $20/2 = $10.

The total cost for one week of dry-cleaning is 25 + 6 + 16 = 47. 5 weeks of dry-cleaning costs 5 * 47 = 235.  The answer is 235. 
[EXP] 1263: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  John's starting speed is 150 words per minute (WPM).  After training, his speed is 2. 5 x 150 = 375 WPM.  He can read 375 words in 1 minute.  To find the time it takes to read 10 pages, we must first calculate the total number of words in 10 pages:

10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

To find the time it takes to read these 4500 words, we can divide the total words by his reading speed:

4500 / 375 = 12

John can read 4500 words in 12 minutes.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 1264: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 500, [output]: 1st day, there were 50 people. 2nd day, there were 20 more than the 1st day, so 20 + 50 = 70.  3rd day, the number of people was twice the 2nd day, which is 2 * 70 = 140.  So now we have 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people.  The remaining 4 days, he saw an average of 60 people per day, so he saw 4 x 60 = 240 people.  Altogether, Conor saw 260 + 240 = 500 people at the beach that week.  The answer is 500. 
[EXP] 1265: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 210, [output]: 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds.  Three times that amount is 3 x 20 = 60. 60 kernels popped in the next 30 seconds.  In the next 30 seconds, the popping rate increased by 4 times the initial popping rate.  The initial rate was 20 kernels in 30 seconds, so the new rate is 20 x 4 = 80. 80 kernels popped in the next 30 seconds.   In the final 30 seconds, the popping slows down to half the rate as the past 30 seconds.   The rate was 80 kernels in 30 seconds, so the new rate is 80 / 2 = 40.   40 kernels popped in the final 30 seconds.  A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds pop in the residual heat.   A quarter of 40 is 40 / 4 = 10.  Add 10 to the 40 and you get 50.  So in total, there were 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = 210.  The answer is 210. 
[EXP] 1266: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Tim needs 1 cup of lemon juice for each gallon of lemonade.   He needs 4 gallons only for the party, but also 1 more for his friend.   So he will need a total of 5 gallons of lemonade.  Since Allen needs his lemonade to be twice as tart, that is 2 times 1 cup = 2 cups of lemon juice.   For the rest of 4 gallons, he will need 4 x 1 cup = 4 cups of lemon juice.    In total, Tim will need 4 + 2 = 6 cups of lemon juice.   1 cup of lemon juice comes from 6 lemons, so 6 cups of lemon juice will come from 6 x 6 = 36 lemons.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 1267: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 147, [output]:  The Kennel house already has 3 German Shepherds and 2 Bulldogs.  For each day:

German Shepherds consume 5 kg x 3 = 15 kg
Bulldogs consume 3 kg x 2 = 6 kg
Total consumption per day is 15 + 6 = 21 kg

Now we want to know how many kg of dog food they will need in a week.  A week has 7 days.  So they will need 21 kg x 7 = 147 kg of dog food.  The answer is 147. 
[EXP] 1268: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 40, [output]: 2-legged animals: 10, so 10 x 2 legs = 20 legs. 4-legged animals: 15, so 15 x 4 legs = 60 legs. 20 + 60 = 80.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 1269: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks means 4 blue blocks and 8 yellow blocks. 4 + 8 = 12 blocks.  In total there are 32 blocks. 32 - 12 = 20.  Since 20 is the amount of blocks left over after 12 blocks are accounted for, 20 must be the number of red blocks.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1270: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 54, [output]:  Let's break this problem down:

Elvis starts driving west for 5 hours.  Since he's driving at a constant speed of 18 mph, he will travel a distance of 5 hours x 18 mph = 90 miles.  So he is 90 miles away from his house. 

Then, he turns around and travels east for 8 hours.  Again, at a constant speed of 18 mph, he will cover a distance of 8 hours x 18 mph = 144 miles. 

Since he traveled 90 miles west and then 144 miles east, he is actually back at the same spot where he started.  So, he is now 0 miles away from his house.  The answer is 0 miles. 
[EXP] 1271: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3528, [output]: 30% of 9000 is 30/100 * 9000 = 2700. 9000 - 2700 = 6300.  The boat was worth 6300 after the first year.  Then, it depreciated another 30%, which is 30/100 * 6300 = 1890.  So the boat was worth 6300 - 1890 = 4410 after the second year.   Then, it depreciated 20%, which is 20/100 * 4410 = 882.  So, the boat was worth 4410 - 882 = 3528 after three years.  The answer is 3528. 
[EXP] 1272: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 43, [output]: 232 candies total.  First, 54 red, twice that number of orange, which means 54 x 2 = 108.  Half as many yellow as red, which means 54 ÷ 2 = 27. 54 + 108 + 27 is 189.  So 232 - 189 = 43, which means the number of pink candies is 43.  The answer is 43. 
[EXP] 1273: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 296, [output]: 1 night at the hotel was $80. 7 bus trips were taken, and each trip was 10% of the hotel rate.  10% of $80 is $8, so 7 times $8 is $56 for the bus trips.  The total hotel and bus cost is $80 + $56 = $136.  The answer is $136. 
[EXP] 1274: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Mazie started with 52 marbles.  She gave them out to Dallas and Darla.  We know Dallas had 21 after dropping 4, so he must have gotten 21 + 4 = 25 marbles from Mazie.  Then Darla must have gotten 52 - 25 = 27 marbles.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 1275: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the cost of the tickets.  There is one child, so the child ticket costs 8 dollars.  Since the parents can't be a child, that means they are both adults, so the adult tickets cost 2 x 12 = 24 dollars.  So the total cost of the tickets is 8 + 24 = 32 dollars.  Next, they buy 2 popcorns for 3 dollars each, so that is 2 x 3 = 6 dollars.  The total amount they pay is 32 + 6 = 38 dollars.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 1276: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 1200 pounds is the weight of the car.  The luggage weighs 250 pounds.  Two children weighing 75 pounds each is 75 x 2 = 150 pounds.   So the total weight is 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600. 1% of the weight is 1600 / 100 * 1 = 16.  The answer is 16.

[EXP] 1282: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Dexter started with 300 pounds of feed.  Each pig eats 4 pounds, twice a day, meaning each pig eats 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.  Since there are 5 pigs, they eat a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pounds of feed per day.  After a week, they have eaten 40 x 7 = 280 pounds of feed.  300 - 280 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 1283: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 20 people are invited and each will eat 2 hot dogs, so 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs. 4 hot dogs are already available, so John still needs 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs. 36 hot dogs can be gotten with 6 hot dogs per pack, 6 * 6 = 36, so John needs 6 packs. 6 packs of hot dogs cost 6 * 2 = 12 dollars. 12 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 1284: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Frances sells 20 cupcakes for 2 dollars each.  So she makes 20 * 2 = 40 dollars from the cupcakes.  She also sells 40 cookies at $1 each.  So she makes 40 * 1 = 40 dollars from the cookies.  In total, she makes 40 + 40 = 80 dollars.  She buys 5 trays at 4 dollars each.  So she spends 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  How much money does she have left?  She started with 80 dollars, and spent 20 dollars.  So she has 80 - 20 = 60 dollars left.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 1285: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 5 children were following the truck initially.  On the second street, each of the 5 children is joined by another child, so 5 + 5 = 10 children are following the truck.  On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more, so 10 + 20 = 30 children are following the truck.  However, the original 5 children then leave the group, so we subtract 5 from 30, resulting in 30 - 5 = 25 children following the truck.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 1286: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1218, [output]: 1360 meals are supposed to be distributed. 64 meals were given out on Friday, 30 on Saturday, and 48 on Sunday. 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals were given out in total. 1360 - 142 = 1218.  The answer is 1218.

[EXP] 1288: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 84, [output]:  Let's start by finding the age of the older brother.  Since one of the brothers is 12 and he is half the age of the older brother, the older brother must be 2 * 12 = 24.  There are 3 sisters, and they are all 16 years old, so the total age of the sisters is 3 * 16 = 48.  There are 2 brothers, the 12-year-old and the 24-year-old, so the total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36.  To find the total age of all siblings, we add the age of the sisters and the age of the brothers: 48 + 36 = 84.  The answer is 84. 
[EXP] 1289: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Charisma meditates for 15 minutes twice a day.  That's a total of 15 * 2 = 30 minutes per day.  In a week, she meditates for 30 * 5 = 150 minutes.   Over 4 weeks, she meditates for 150 * 4 = 600 minutes.  She practices an hour of yoga each day 5 days a week, so that is 5 * 60 = 300 minutes per week.  Over 4 weeks, that is 300 * 4 = 1200 minutes.   To find the total minutes of meditation and yoga, we add those together: 600 minutes + 1200 minutes = 1800 minutes.  The answer is 1800.

The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 1292: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  George has 18 pens.  Timothy has three times as many pens as George, so Timothy has 18 x 3 = 54 pens.  Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, so Sarah has 54 / 2 = 27 pens.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 1293: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 67, [output]:  Albert is 36 inches tall.  Anne is twice the size of Albert, so Anne is 36 * 2 = 72 inches tall.   Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne, so Jackie is 72 - 2 = 70 inches tall now.  Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer, so she was 70 - 3 = 67 inches tall before the summer.  The answer is 67. 
[EXP] 1294: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 140000, [output]: 5000 bars per day. 2 weeks is 14 days.  So in total, the company produced 5000 x 14 = 70000 bars.  Each bar is sold for $2, so in total the company will receive $2 x 70000 = 140000$.  The answer is 140000. 
[EXP] 1295: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, let's calculate the cost of the T-shirts.  The original price is $8, and there's a buy one get one 50% off deal, so the total cost of the two T-shirts is:

2 x $8 = $16

Since one T-shirt is 50% off, the discount is:

$8 x 0. 5 = $4

So, the total cost of the T-shirts is:

$16 - $4 = $12

Now, let's calculate the cost of the shoes.  The original price is $40, and there's a 40% off deal, so the discount is:

$40 x 0. 4 = $16

The cost of the shoes after the discount is:

$40 - $16 = $24

Now, let's add the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

$12 + $24 = $36

So, Jake spends a total of $36 at the store.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 1296: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ryan earns $6 each week he completes his chores. 3 weeks gives him 6 * 3 = 18 dollars.  He buys ice cream cones for 4 people at 1. 25 each.  That is 4 * 1. 25 = 5.  He has 18 - 5 = 13 dollars left.  The movie tickets cost 6. 50 each.   13 / 6. 50 = 2.  So he can buy 2 movie tickets.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1297: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 335, [output]:  Ellen spent:

* $100 on the leggings
* $5 on the photo frame
* Total: $100 + $5 = $105

Lani spent:

* $30 on the sunglasses
* $200 on the two bathrobes ($100 x 2)
* Total: $30 + $200 = $230

The total amount spent by Ellen and Lani is:

$105 + $230 = $335

The answer is $335. 
[EXP] 1298: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  To make 1 jar of the mixture, Tim needs 2 pounds of passion fruit, 1. 5 pounds of jackfruit, and 2 pounds of honey.  So for 10 jars, he will need 10 times more of each ingredient: 20 pounds of passion fruit, 15 pounds of jackfruit, and 20 pounds of honey.  Let's calculate the cost: 
Cost of passion fruit: 20 pounds * 6 dollars per pound = 120 dollars
Cost of jackfruit: 15 pounds * 8 dollars per pound = 120 dollars
Cost of honey: 20 pounds * 10 dollars per pound = 200 dollars

Total cost: 120 + 120 + 200 = 440 dollars

Tim sells each jar for 50 dollars, so for 10 jars, he makes 10 * 50 = 500 dollars.  To find the profit, subtract the total cost from the total income: 
Profit = 500 - 440 = 60 dollars

The answer is 60 dollars. 
[EXP] 1299: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]: 32 quarters is 32 x $0. 25 = $8.  95 dimes is 95 x $0. 1 = $9. 5.  120 nickels is 120 x $0. 05 = $6. 00.  750 pennies is 750 x $0. 01 = $7.  50.   To find the total amount, we add the amounts from quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies: $8 + $9.  5 + $6.  00 + $7.  50 = $31.  50.  The answer is $31. 
[EXP] 1300: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Janet started with $40.  She spent $3. 50 on ice cream, $7. 50 on movie tickets for herself, and $7. 50 on movie tickets for her sister, and $8. 50 on a bracelet.  Adding these amounts together, she spent a total of $3. 50 + $7.  50 + $7.  50 + $8.  50 = $26.   So, she spent a total of $26.  To find out how much money Janet has left, we subtract $26 from $40.  40 - 26 is $14.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 1301: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 7 days a week, Josh is open. 7 - 2 (except Sunday and Wednesday) = 5 days a week.  He services 3 cars a day, so in total he services 3 x 5 = 15 cars a week.  He gets 4 dollars per car, so in total he makes 4 x 15 = 60 dollars a week.  He does this for 2 weeks, so in total he makes 60 x 2 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 1302: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Randy started with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies.  
Total cookies he had is 9 + 4 + 5 = 18.  

He eats 3 cookies, one of each flavor.  So he had 18 - 3 = 15 cookies left. 

He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.  So he had 15 - 2 = 13 cookies.  Then he gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.   After that, he had 13 - 2 = 11 cookies.  

Then, he bakes 4 cookies of each flavor.   So, he bakes 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 cookies.   So, the total cookies he has now is 11 + 12 = 23.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 1303: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Matthew has 12 toy soldiers. 12 toy soldiers divided by two is 6, so half of his collection is 6 toys. 6 toys at 5 dollars each is 6 * 5 = 30 dollars.  The other half of the collection is 6 toys at 7 dollars each is 6 * 7 = 42 dollars.  To calculate total earned, we must add 30 and 42.   30 + 42 = 72.  The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 1304: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

The dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days, so the dog digs a total of 6 x 14 = 84 holes during the 14 days.  Nate gets home and starts filling in 9 holes a day.  But the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night, so for every 9 holes Nate fills in, the dog creates 6 new ones.   That means net progress per day is 9 - 6 = 3 holes filled in per day. 

To find out how many days it takes to fill in all the holes, we can divide the total number of holes (84) by the net progress per day (3):

84 ÷ 3 = 28

So it will take Nate 28 days to fill in all the holes.  Since we are asked to find the number of weeks, we can divide the number of days by 7:

28 ÷ 7 = 4

It will take Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 1305: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1000, [output]:  Butlers enrollment average is 3/4 of Normans. 4000 * 3/4 is 3000. 4000 - 3000 is 1000.  The answer is 1000. 
[EXP] 1306: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2325, [output]: 7995 cookies were made in total.  They had 2595 rainbow cookies and 3075 oatmeal cookies. 2595 + 3075 is 5670.  So they have 7995 - 5670 = 2325 chocolate chip cookies left.  The answer is 2325. 
[EXP] 1307: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Dr.  Grumpus wanted Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.  Let's first calculate the total number of items requested: 16 + 7 + 14 = 37. 

Igor had half as many test tubes as requested, which is 16 / 2 = 8.  Igor had two more Petri dishes than requested, which is 14 + 2 = 16.  So, the total number of items Igor gathered is 8 test tubes + 7 beakers + 16 Petri dishes = 31.  Since Igor actually had 29 items on the lab bench, he lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1308: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Each table has 4 legs, and each leg needs 2 screws.  So each table needs 4 x 2 = 8 screws.  There are 4 tables, so James will need 8 x 4 = 32 screws.  He has 40 screws, so he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left.   The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 1309: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  If there are twice as many eggs in the second basket, that means there are 10 x 2 = 20 eggs in the second basket. 10 eggs in the first basket and 20 eggs in the second basket means there are 10 + 20 eggs in total. 10 + 20 is 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 1310: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  Angie raises 320 more than Alexandra.  Alexandra raises 430.  So Angie raises 430 + 320 = 750.  Maryam raises 400 more than Sarah.  Sarah raises 300.  So Maryam raises 300 + 400 = 700.  Total it is 750 + 430 + 700 + 300. 750 + 430 = 1180. 1180 + 700 = 1880. 1880 + 300 = 2180.  The answer is 2180. 
[EXP] 1311: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, so if Aaron ran X miles, Vanessa ran 2X miles.  Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, that means Aaron's speed is (X miles) / (16 minutes).  Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's, which is (X miles) / (16 minutes) * 1/2.  Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, we know that 2X = 4, so X = 2.  Therefore, Vanessa's speed is (2 miles) / (16 minutes) * 1/2 = 1/8 miles/minute.  Since she ran 4 miles, it took her 4 * 8 = 32 minutes.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 1312: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 594, [output]: 200 feet of dock, with 3 feet of line for every foot of dock, requires 200 x 3 = 600 feet of line. 6 feet of line is already available. 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line need to be bought. 594 feet.  The answer is 594. 
[EXP] 1313: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]: 6 reservations per night means Tom's restaurant serves 6 groups of customers in one night. 2 meals that cost $5 each is 2 x $5 = $10. 1 $5 bottle of wine is added, so the total amount per group is $10 + $5 = $15. 6 groups are served each night, so in one night, Tom's restaurant makes 6 x $15 = $90. 2 days of the week means total revenue is 2 x $90 = $180.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 1314: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 80 dollars was spent on watermelons.  There are 50 watermelons.  The cost of 1 watermelon is 80 / 50 = 1. 6 dollars. 

He then sold the watermelons at a profit of 25%.  He sold them for 125% of the cost.  So each watermelon was sold for 1. 6 * 1. 25 = 2.  This is his selling price.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 1315: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

1.  James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years.  So, Dora's current age is 9 (since she will turn 12 in 3 years).  James' current age is 2 x 9 = 18. 
2.  James is John's son, and John had a son James when he was 19.  So John was 19 years old when James was born.  Therefore, James is currently 18 years old, and John is 37 years old (19 + 18).  John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so his youngest son is currently 5 years old.  In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 1316: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange.  Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange.   After 1 hour, or 60 minutes, Ana can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges.  Jane can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges.   After peeling 20 oranges, Ana will have peeled 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1317: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]: 400 - 80% of 400 = 400 - 0. 8 * 400 = 400 - 320 = 80. 80 is the cost of the radiator.  The mechanic costs 50 per hour and works for 3 hours.   50 * 3 = 150.  So the total cost is 80 + 150.  80 + 150 = 230.   The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 1318: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 20 animals are either chickens or cows.  They have a total of 70 legs.  Each chicken has 2 legs, while each cow has 4 legs.  Let's say the number of chickens is C.  Then, the number of cows is 20 - C.  Since there are a total of 70 legs, we know that:

2*C + 4*(20 - C) = 70

We can simplify this equation:

2*C + 80 - 4*C = 70
-2*C + 80 = 70
-2*C = -10
C = 5

Since the number of chickens is 5, we know that the number of cows is 20 - 5 = 15.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 1319: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 7 pizzas with 8 slices each means there are 7 x 8 = 56 slices in total.  Henry and his 3 friends are a total of 4 people.  To divide the slices equally, we need to divide 56 slices by 4. 56 / 4 is 14.  The answer is 14.

First, let's calculate the saving for each item:

* Ice cream: Original price - new price = saving.  13 - 11 = 2 dollars per tub of ice cream. 
* Milk: Original price - new price = saving.  If the packet of milk was sold at a discount of $0. 5, then the new price is the original price - $0. 5.  We don't know the original price, but since it's a discount, we know it's lower than the original price.  Let's assume the original price was x.  Then, the new price is x - $0. 5.  So, the saving is x - (x - $0. 5) = $0. 5 per packet of milk. 

Now, let's calculate the total saving for the given quantities:

* Ice cream: 2 tubs of ice cream means 2 x 2 = 4 dollars saving. 
* Milk: 4 packets of milk means 4 x 0. 5 = 2 dollars saving. 
* Total saving: 4 + 2 = 6 dollars.

So she needs 5 + 5 + 20 = 30 dollars.  Now, she has 90 - 30 = 60 dollars left.  She can invite friends until there is no more money left.  Note that she can only invite an even number of friends because each friend will cost 30 / 2 = 15 dollars.  The last friend will cost too much.  So she can invite 60 / 15 = 4 friends.

On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes. 

The next day, they sold double that number of shoes, which is 2 x 14 = 28 pairs. 

On the last day of the sale, they sold one-half the amount they did the day before, which is 28/2 = 14 pairs. 

However, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit, so we have to subtract those from the total:

14 + 28 + 14 - 6 = 50

[EXP] 62: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Let's solve the problem step by step. 

First, we know Kenny has $50 in spending cash after selling some Pokemon cards.  This means he made a total of $100 (the cost of the ticket) - $50 = $50 by selling cards. 

Since he makes $1. 5 per card, he sold a total of $50 / $1. 5 = 33. 33 cards (round down to 33, since you can't sell a fraction of a card). 

However, the problem states that Kenny keeps 1/3 of the cards.  So, the total cards he started with is equal to the number of cards he sold plus the number of cards he kept:

Let x be the total number of cards Kenny started with.  Then, the number of cards he sold is x - (1/3)x = 2/3x. 

We also know that the number of cards he sold is 33, so we can set up the equation:

2/3x = 33

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/2:

x = 33 * 3/2
x = 49. 5

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so his age 5 years ago is x/2. 

Jerry's current age is x, so his age 5 years ago is x - 5. 

We can set up the equation:

x/2 = x - 5

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 2(x - 5)

Expanding the right side, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

- x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides gives:

x = 10

So Jerry is currently 10 years old.

So let's first find the number of votes against the regulation.  If x is the number of votes against the regulation, then 2x is the number of votes in favor of the regulation.  The total number of votes is 33, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

x = 11

So there were 11 votes against the regulation.  And twice as many votes in favor:

[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the number of cases of shingles needed for each house.  

Let's say the first house needs x cases of shingles.  Then, the second house needs 2x cases of shingles (since the second house needs 1/2 of the second house, which is equal to 2x). 

The total number of cases of shingles needed is 250.  

The total number of cases needed is the sum of the cases needed for each house:

x + 2x + ? (third house)

We know the first house takes up half of the second house, and the third house takes up the rest.  The third house will take up the remaining 250 - (x + 2x) cases. 

Since the third house takes up double the amount of the first house, it will take up 2x cases. 

250 = x + 2x + 2x

250 = 5x

5x = 250

x = 50

So the first house takes 50 cases of shingles, the second house takes 2x which is 100 cases, and the third house takes 2 times the first house which is 100 cases. 

The answer is 100.

* 1 large mask (since 2 yards can make 3 large masks, and she can't make a part of a large mask)

So, for every 2 yards, she can make 4 small masks or 1 large mask. 

To make 20 small masks, she needs:
* 20 / 4 = 5 sets of 2 yards (since she needs 4 small masks for each set)

And to make 8 large masks, she needs:
* 8 / 3 = 2 and 2/3 (you can't make a part of a large mask, so you need to round up to the next whole amount, which is 3).  Since 2 and 2/3 can be represented as 8/3, and Jo has 2 yards which can make 1 large mask, she needs 2 more yards to make 1 more large mask. 

In total, Jo needs:
* 5 sets of 2 yards for small masks = 10 yards
* 2 more yards for large masks = 2 yards

So, Jo needs 10 + 2 = 12 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step! 

Let's say John's age is x. 

Paul is 10 years older than John, so Paul's age is x + 10. 

Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 10 + x + (x + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4x = 80

Divide by 4:

x = 20

So John's age is 20 years old, Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30 years old, and Peter's age is 2x + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 years old. 

The answer is 50.

Then, he has 20 - 12 = 8 miles left to swim.  He swims at half his original speed, which is 2/2 = 1 mile per hour.  So, it takes him 8/1 = 8 hours to finish the remaining distance. 

In total, it took James 6 hours to swim the first part, 3 hours to rest, and 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.  So, the total time it took him to get across the lake is 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 hours.

Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small stuffed animals. 
She sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones. 
She earned $120 from the sales. 
Each small stuffed animal costs $4. 

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals she sold is x. 
Then, the number of small stuffed animals she sold is 2x, since she sold twice as many small ones. 

Since each large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, the amount earned from large stuffed animals is 3x times the price of a small one (3x * 4 = 12x). 
The amount earned from small stuffed animals is 2x times the price of a small one (2x * 4 = 8x). 

The total amount earned is $120, so the sum of the amounts earned from large and small stuffed animals is equal to $120:

12x + 8x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.  This means they had some bandages left over, and the total number of bandages they had at the end of the day is:

50 (from the bulk pack) + (unknown number of initial bandages) - 38 (used) = unknown number of bandages left

Let's call the unknown number of initial bandages "x".  Then, the equation becomes:

50 + x - 38 = unknown number of bandages left

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 12 = unknown number of bandages left

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day, which means they used 28 bandages (38 - 10 = 28).  They still had 78 bandages left at the end of the day, so the total number of bandages they had is:

unknown number of bandages left (from the previous day) + 50 (from the bulk pack) - 28 (used) = 78

Substituting the expression we found earlier, we get:

(x + 12) + 50 - 28 = 78

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 34 = 78

Subtracting 34 from both sides, we get:

x = 44

So, the nurses started with 44 bandages on the first day. 

Therefore, the answer is 44.

[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430.  So Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750. 

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300.  So Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700. 

To find the total amount of money they raised, we add up their individual amounts:

$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $300 (Sarah) + $700 (Maryam) = $2180

The answer is 2180.

[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 4 years ago, Adrien's salary was 40,000 dollars.  This is also 30% higher than Lylah's salary, so Lylah's salary is 30% less than 40,000 dollars.  We can calculate this as follows:
40,000 - (30/100 * 40,000) = 40,000 - 12,000 = 28,000

So Lylah's salary 4 years ago was 28,000 dollars.  After 4 years, both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased by 40%.  This means Adrien's salary increased by 40% of 40,000 dollars, which is 16,000 dollars.  His new salary is 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 dollars.  Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of 28,000, which is 11,200 dollars.  Her new salary is 28,000 + 11,200 = 39,200 dollars. 

So, four years later, Adrien's salary is 56,000 dollars and Lylah's salary is 39,200 dollars.  Their combined salaries are 56,000 + 39,200 = 95,200 dollars.

40,000 - (30/100 * 40,000) = 40,000 - 12,000 = 28,000

So Lylah's salary 4 years ago was 28,000 dollars.  After 4 years, both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased by 40%.  This means Adrien's salary increased by 40% of 40,000 dollars, which is 16,000 dollars.  His new salary is 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000 dollars.  Lylah's salary also increased by 40% of 28,000, which is 11,200 dollars.  Her new salary is 28,000 + 11,200 = 39,200 dollars.

[EXP] 29: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 200 pounds of carrots are to be distributed to 40 restaurants.  Each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds.  To find the total number of pounds that the restaurants will receive, we can multiply the number of restaurants by the number of pounds each receives: 40 restaurants * 2 pounds per restaurant = 80 pounds. 

The restaurants will receive 80 pounds of carrots, and 200 pounds are available.  To find the number of pounds that will not be used, we can subtract the number of pounds the restaurants will receive from the total amount: 200 - 80 = 120 pounds.

[EXP] 62: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Let's start by identifying what we know:

1.  Kenny is selling his cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100. 
2.  He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1. 5 each. 
3.  He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. 

To solve this problem, we can start by translating the information into an equation.  Let's say Kenny had x cards initially.  Then, he sells x - 1/3x = 2/3x cards at $1. 5 each.  This will give him an amount of money, which we can call y. 

y = 2/3x * 1. 5

This is because he keeps 1/3 of the cards and gets the remaining 2/3 multiplied by the selling price of $1. 5. 

Now we can format it this way:

y = 1/2x

Since he goes to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash, we can set y - 100 = 50:

1/2x - 100 = 50

Adding 100 to both sides, we get:

1/2x = 150

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

x = 300

So, Kenny started with 300 cards.

Bread costs $3 per loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches, so bread costs 3 dollars per 10 sandwiches.  They also spend 30 dollars on cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  So the total cost per 10 sandwiches is 3 + 30 = 33 dollars.  Then they sell 10 sandwiches for 7 dollars each, so they get 7 * 10 = 70 dollars per 10 sandwiches.  To find the profit, you subtract the total cost from the total revenue.  The profit would be 70 - 33 = 37 dollars.

[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  First, let's figure out how many miles Andy is driving in a day.  He drives 5 miles one way to his office every day, so that's 5 + 5 = 10 miles per day.  He does this 5 days a week, so the total miles he drives per week is 10 * 5 = 50 miles. 

Next, we know Andy's car can go 10 miles on a gallon.  To find out how much gas he consumes per week, we can divide the total miles he drives per week by the miles he gets per gallon: 50 miles / 10 miles/gallon = 5 gallons per week. 

Finally, we know the price of gas is $3 per gallon.  To find out how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we can multiply the amount of gas he uses by the price of gas: 5 gallons * $3 = $15. 

The answer is $15.

Let Paul's age be P, John's age be J, and Peter's age be X. 

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so X = P + J. 

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so P = J + 10. 

Now we can substitute P = J + 10 into the first equation to get X = (J + 10) + J. 

Combine like terms: X = 2J + 10. 

We also know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old, so X + P + J = 100. 

Substitute X = 2J + 10 and P = J + 10 into this equation: (2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100. 

Combine like terms: 4J + 20 = 100. 

Subtract 20 from both sides: 4J = 80. 

Divide by 4: J = 20. 

Now that we know J = 20, we can find P = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30. 

And finally, we can find X = P + J = 30 + 20 = 50.

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, we know that Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  Let's call the number of large stuffed animals x.  Then, the number of small stuffed animals is 2x. 

Next, we know that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal.  Let's call the price of a small stuffed animal $4, so the price of a large stuffed animal is 3 x $4 = $12. 

Let's calculate the total amount of money Teresa earned from the sales of large and small stuffed animals:

From large stuffed animals: x x $12 = $12x
From small stuffed animals: 2x x $4 = $8x

The total amount of money Teresa earned is the sum of these two amounts: $12x + $8x = $20x

We know that the total amount of money Teresa earned is $120, so we can set up the equation:

$20x = $120

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 20:

x = $120 / 20
x = $6

So, Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x = 2(6) = 12 small stuffed animals. 

The answer is 12.

The tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops, and then the velociraptors ate half of what was left.  So, let's call the original amount of meat on the triceratops "x".  The T-Rex ate half of it, which means it ate x/2.  This left x - x/2 = x/2 kilograms of meat. 

Then, the velociraptors ate half of what was left, which is half of x/2, or (x/2)/2 = x/4.  This left (x/2) - (x/4) = x/4 kilograms of meat. 

Finally, the Allosaurus ate the remaining 270 kilograms.  This means that x/4 = 270. 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 4: x = 4 ร 270 = 1080.

On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack.  So, they used 38 + 50 = 88 bandages.  

On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than on the first day, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. 

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages.  They only used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages.  So, in total, they used 28 + 25 = 53 bandages.

[EXP] 184: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Dexter has 5 pigs.  Each pig eats 4 pounds of feed, and that is twice a day.  So each pig eats 4 x 2 = 8 pounds of feed per day.  For all 5 pigs, that is 5 x 8 = 40 pounds of feed per day.  In 7 days, 40 x 7 = 280 pounds of feed will be eaten.  Since he ordered 300 pounds, there will be 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left.  The answer is 20.

[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]: 80% off means he gets a discount of 80% of the original price.  80% of $400 is (80/100)*400 = $320.  So the price of the radiator is 400 - 320 = $80.  

He then pays $50 an hour for 3 hours, so the labor cost is 50 * 3 = 150.  

In total, Mark paid $80 for the radiator and $150 for the labor, so he paid $80 + $150 = $230.  The answer is $230.

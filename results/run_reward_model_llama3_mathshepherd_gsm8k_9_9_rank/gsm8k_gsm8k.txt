To find the new value of the house, multiply the original value by 3 (150% is 1. 5, and multiplying by 2 will get you 200%, so multiplying by 1. 5 is increasing by 150%): 80,000 x 3 = 240,000. 

To find the profit, subtract the cost (the price of the house and the repairs) from the new value: 240,000 - (80,000 + 50,000) = 240,000 - 130,000 = 110,000.

[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

1.  Carla can download 2 GB per minute.  Since the file is 200 GB, to find out how many minutes she would normally take to download the file, we can divide 200 GB by 2 GB/minute: 200 ÷ 2 = 100 minutes. 
2.  However, 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart.  To find the size of the file downloaded so far, we can multiply the total file size by 40% (or 0. 4): 200 x 0. 4 = 80 GB.  This is the amount she has downloaded before the restart. 
3.  The restart takes 20 minutes.  So, we can subtract this time from the total download time to find the remaining time: 100 minutes - 20 minutes = 80 minutes. 
4.  After the restart, Carla has to start again from the beginning, which means she's only done the first 80 GB.  Since the file size is 200 GB, she has 120 GB left to download (200 - 80 = 120).  To find the time it takes to download the remaining file, we can divide the remaining file size by her download rate: 120 GB ÷ 2 GB/minute = 60 minutes. 
5.  Adding the time spent downloading before the restart (80 minutes) and the time spent downloading after the restart (60 minutes), we get the total time it takes to download the file: 80 minutes + 60 minutes = 140 minutes. 

So, it takes Carla 140 minutes to download the file.

[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Since Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we need to figure out how many she started with.  Let's break this down step by step.  

Let's say she started with x vacuum cleaners. 

She sold a third of x vacuum cleaners at the green house.  This means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house.  

Now, she has x - (x/3) - 2 vacuum cleaners left.  

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house.  Half of what was left is (x - (x/3) - 2)/2.  

This means we can set up the equation:

x - ((x/3) - 2) - ((x - (x/3) - 2)/2) = 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x - (x/3) - 2 - (x/2 + 1) = 5

Multiplying both sides by 6 (to get rid of the fractions), we get:

6x - 2x - 12 - 3x - 6 = 30

Combine like terms:

x - 18 = 30

Add 18 to both sides:

x = 48

So, Melanie started with 48 vacuum cleaners. 

The answer is 48.

So, she has to feed the puppy a total of 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food in the first year.  Since each bag contains 110 cups, she will use 550 / 110 = 5 bags of dog food in the first year.

[EXP] 78: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's figure out the amount of laundry each person does. 

Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. 

Sarah does 4 times as much as David, so David does 400 ÷ 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. 

Raymond does half as much as Sarah, so Raymond does 400 ÷ 2 = 200 pounds of laundry. 

Now we need to find the difference between Raymond and David.  Raymond does 200 pounds, and David does 100 pounds.  The difference is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds. 

The answer is 100.

[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Henry wants to make twice as many cookies as he did last year.  Let's call the number of cookies he made last year x.  This year, he wants to make 2x cookies. 

He actually baked 15 more cookies than expected, so he baked 2x + 15 cookies. 

He then dropped 5 cookies, so he now has a total of 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies. 

This total of 2x + 10 cookies is equal to 110 cookies.  So, we set up the equation:

2x + 10 = 110

To solve for x, we subtract 10 from both sides:

2x = 100

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 50

So, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

First, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.  Let x be the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.  Then Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs. 

Second, the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.  So, x = 50n, where n is the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. 

Third, Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.  Since Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs, we have:

6x = 1800
x = 1800 / 6
x = 300

So Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. 

Now, we know that x = 50n, and x = 300.  We can substitute x = 300 into the equation x = 50n:

300 = 50n
n = 300 / 50
n = 6

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

There are twice as many baby bees as queens.  So the number of baby bees is equal to 2 times the number of queens.  Let's call the number of queens Q.  Then B = 2Q. 

We know the total number of bees is 700.  So we can set up another equation: W + B + Q = 700. 

Substituting B = 2Q and W = 2B, we get:
2B + 2Q + Q = 700

Combine like terms and solve for B:
3Q + 2B = 700
3Q + 2(2Q) = 700
3Q + 4Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 100

Now we know the number of queens is 100.  We can find the number of baby bees by substituting Q into B = 2Q:
B = 2(100)
B = 200

We can find the number of worker bees by substituting B into W = 2B:
W = 2(200)

* Bottles of bleach: 2 x $2 = $4 per client
* Packs of cloths: 1 x $5 = $5 per client

Since there are 8 clients, the total cost of supplies will be:

$9 per client x 8 clients = $72

Lucas's total income each week is $92.  To find his profit, we subtract the total cost of supplies from his total income:

$92 (total income) - $72 (total cost of supplies) = $20

[EXP] 182: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Sandra ordered 4 times as many red roses as white carnations, so let's call the number of white carnations x.  Then the number of red roses is 4x. 

She also ordered 5 times the number of white carnations in pink calla lilies, so the number of pink calla lilies is 5x. 

The total number of flowers is the sum of the red roses, white carnations, and pink calla lilies: 4x + x + 5x = 10x. 

We know the number of pink calla lilies is 200, so we can set up the equation 5x = 200 and solve for x:

x = 40

So, the number of white carnations is 40. 

Now, we can find the number of red roses: 4x = 4(40) = 160.

[EXP] 183: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's start by assuming Mark's current age is M.  Since Jean is two years older than Mark, Jean's current age is M + 2. 

Two years ago, Mark's age was M - 2, and Jan's age was 30 - 2 = 28.  According to the problem, at that time Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, so we can set up the equation:

M - 2 = (28/2) + 5

Simplifying the equation, we get:

M - 2 = 14 + 5

M - 2 = 19

M = 21

So Mark is currently 21 years old, and Jean is 21 + 2 = 23 years old. 

The answer is 23.

Rabbits get 20 straws together. 
In total, that's 50 + 20 = 70 straws among hamsters and rabbits. 
So, 160 - 70 = 90 straws are left for the rats. 
Rats get 6 straws each and are kept in equal groups in 3 cages.  To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the remaining straws among the rats:
90 / 6 = 15. 
This means there are 15 rats per cage.

1.  The trader buys the bags at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the bags is unknown x bags * $20 per bag = $20x. 
2.  It costs $2 to transport each bag, so the total transportation cost is x bags * $2 per bag = $2x. 
3.  The trader sold the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the total revenue is x bags * $30 per bag = $30x. 
4.  The trader made a total profit of $400, so the total revenue minus the total cost and transportation cost must equal $400. 
   $30x - ($20x + $2x) = $400
   $30x - $22x = $400

The number of eggs produced by red chickens is 3x, and the number of eggs produced by white chickens is 5(x + 2) = 5x + 10.  The total number of eggs produced is the sum of eggs from red and white chickens, which is 3x + 5x + 10 = 8x + 10.  This total number of eggs is equal to 42, so we set up the equation:

8x + 10 = 42

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

8x = 32

Dividing both sides by 8 gives us:

x = 4

So Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Since the two pools lose water at the same rate (4 gallons/minute), after 4 minutes, each pool will lose 4 times as much water.  So the small pool will have x - 4(4) = x - 16 gallons of water, and the big pool will have 2x - 4(4) = 2x - 16 gallons of water. 

Now, the problem states that the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.  This means:
2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)
2x - 16 = 4x - 64
2x = 4x - 48
48 = 2x
x = 24

So the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago.  4 minutes have passed, so the small pool has lost 4 x 4 = 16 gallons of water.  Therefore, the small pool has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water now.  The answer is 8.

[EXP] 284: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  To solve this problem, we can start by finding the total length of topaz gemstones in each necklace.  There are 8 topaz gemstones, each 1 inch long, so the total length of the topaz gemstones is 8 inches.  

Then, to find the total length of the necklace, we subtract the length of the topaz gemstones from the total length of the necklace: 25 - 8 = 17 inches.  

Since each sterling silver bead is 1/4 inches long, we can find the number of sterling silver beads used by dividing the remaining length by the length of each bead: 17 inches / 1/4 inches per bead = 68 beads. 

The answer is 68.

There are also half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense.  So the number of special teams players is x/2. 

The total number of players is the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams: 105 = 2x + x + (x/2)

Solve this equation to find x, the number of defense players. 

First, combine the terms with x: 2x + x + x/2 = 105

Then combine like terms: 5x/2 + x = 105

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 5x + 2x = 210

Combine like terms again: 7x = 210

Divide both sides by 7: x = 30

So, the defense has 30 players.

If Nick is in a state with a 20% tax rate, then Nick will pay 20% of $30,000 in taxes.  20% of $30,000 is $6,000, so $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.  

Nick has Job A, so his net pay is $24,000. 

For Job B, let's first calculate the property tax.  $6,000 in property tax will leave $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000 in income after property tax.  If the state charges a 10% tax rate on the net income, then 10% of $36,000 is $3,600.  $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.  

Nick has Job B, so his net pay is $32,400. 

To find how much more Nick will make with the Job with the higher net pay rate, we subtract the pay with Job A from the pay with Job B.  $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.  The answer is $8,400. 
 Voted result:  First, let's calculate Nick's pay for Job A.  2000 hours a year * $15 an hour = $30,000 a year.  If Nick is in a state with a 20% tax rate, then Nick will pay 20% of $30,000 in taxes.  20% of $30,000 is $6,000, so $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.  

Nick has Job A, so his net pay is $24,000. 

For Job B, let's first calculate the property tax.  $6,000 in property tax will leave $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000 in income after property tax.  If the state charges a 10% tax rate on the net income, then 10% of $36,000 is $3,600.  $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.  

Nick has Job B, so his net pay is $32,400. 

To find how much more Nick will make with the Job with the higher net pay rate, we subtract the pay with Job A from the pay with Job B.  $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.  The answer is $8,400.

[EXP] 340: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's start by figuring out how many of each type of animal there are.  Since Farmer Brown has twice as many chickens as cows, we can say that the number of chickens is 2x and the number of cows is x.  The total number of animals is 60, so we can set up the equation:

2x + x = 60

Combine like terms:

3x = 60

Divide by 3:

x = 20

So there are 20 cows and 40 chickens (2 times 20). 

Each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs.  So, the number of legs on the chickens is:

40 chickens * 2 legs/chicken = 80 legs

The number of legs on the cows is:

20 cows * 4 legs/cow = 80 legs

In total, the animals have:

80 legs (from chickens) + 80 legs (from cows) = 160 legs

So the animals have a total of 160 legs.

Candy costs $1. 5 a pound, so we don't know how many pounds of candy he bought.  Let's call it x pounds.  The cost of candy will be 1. 5x.  So he has 10 - 1. 5x left.  Now, he takes half of his change (10 - 1. 5x) / 2 and buys gumballs costing $. 05 each.  He bought 40 gumballs.  So (10 - 1. 5x) / 2 = 0. 05 * 40.  Simplify this equation:
(10 - 1. 5x) / 2 = 2

Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
10 - 1. 5x = 4

Add 1. 5x to both sides:

Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.  The answer is 4. 
 Voted result: [" Billy started with $10.  He bought candy, so let's first figure out how much change he has left.  Candy costs $1. 5 a pound, so we don't know how many pounds of candy he bought.  Let's call it x pounds.  The cost of candy will be 1. 5x.  So he has 10 - 1. 5x left.  Now, he takes half of his change (10 - 1. 5x) / 2 and buys gumballs costing $. 05 each.  He bought 40 gumballs.  So (10 - 1. 5x) / 2 = 0. 05 * 40.  Simplify this equation:\n(10 - 1. 5x) / 2 = 2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\n10 - 1. 5x = 4\n\nAdd 1. 5x to both sides:\n10 = 1. 5x + 4\n\nSubtract 4 from both sides:\n6 = 1. 5x\n\nDivide both sides by 1. 5:\nx = 4\n\nBilly bought 4 pounds of candy.

[EXP] 361: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Let's start with what we know: Carver is 45 years old.  We know that he is 5 years less than twice his son's age.  This means that 2x - 5 = 45, where x is his son's age. 

We can solve for x by adding 5 to both sides of the equation: 2x = 45 + 5 = 50. 

Then, we can divide both sides by 2 to find x: x = 50/2 = 25. 

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

[EXP] 417: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 56, [output]: 304 bumps means that there are camels and dromedaries.  We can start by assuming that x represents the number of camels and y the number of dromedaries.  

Camels have 2 humps, so camels + x will have 2x humps.  Dromedaries have 1 hump, so dromedaries + y will have y humps.  In total, the number of humps will be 2x + y. 

The total number of heads is the combined number of camels and dromedaries, which is x + y.  

We also know that the total number of humps is 304 and the total number of heads is 180.  

So, we have two equations: 
2x + y = 304
x + y = 180

We can solve the second equation for x.  x = 180 - y. 

Then substitute x into the first equation: 
2(180 - y) + y = 304

We can simplify: 360 - 2y + y = 304
-2y + y = -56
-y = -56
y = 56

Now that we know the number of dromedaries (y), we can find the number of camels (x).  
x = 180 - y
x = 180 - 56
x = 124

So, there are 124 camels and 56 dromedaries.

[EXP] 418: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3140, [output]:  Let's break down Tom's travel schedule:

First, Tom traveled for 4 days at 200 kilometers per day, so he covered a distance of 4 x 200 = 800 kilometers. 

Next, he traveled for 2 days at 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.  The distance he traveled in the first 4 days is 800 kilometers, so 30% of that is 0. 3 x 800 = 240 kilometers.  So Tom traveled 240 kilometers over the next 2 days. 

He was not traveling at all on the next day, so his distance for that day is 0 kilometers. 

During the second week, he traveled for 7 days at 300 kilometers per day, so he covered a distance of 7 x 300 = 2100 kilometers. 

Now, let's calculate the total distance Tom covered over his two-week-long trip:

First 4 days: 800 kilometers
Next 2 days: 240 kilometers
Next 1 day: 0 kilometers
Second week: 2100 kilometers

Total distance = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 kilometers

[EXP] 441: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 98, [output]:  Since the area is 360 square feet, we need to find the width of the room first.  If the length is 3 yards, then we need to convert yards to feet.  Since there are 3 feet in 1 yard, the length is 3 x 3 = 9 feet.  Now we have 360 area and 9 length, and we need to find the width.  We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is:

Area = Length * Width

360 = 9 * Width
Width = 360 / 9
Width = 40

So the width is 40 feet.  Now we can find the perimeter, which is the distance around the room.  The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2 * (Length + Width)

Perimeter = 2 * (9 + 40)
Perimeter = 2 * 49
Perimeter = 98

The perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 98 feet.  The answer is 98.

[EXP] 444: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 59, [output]:  Let's start by converting the bike ride time from hours and minutes to just minutes.  1 hour and 20 minutes is 80 minutes. 

Jon's total time for the events was:
40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes

Let's calculate James' swim time based on taking 10% less than Jon.  A 10% decrease from Jon's 40 minutes is:
40 - (10% of 40) = 40 - 4 = 36 minutes

James' bike time is 5 minutes more than Jon's, so it's:
80 + 5 = 85 minutes

James' total time is:
36 minutes (swim) + 85 minutes (bike) + ? minutes (run) = ?

Since James was 10 minutes behind Jon, we can set up the equation:
James' total time = Jon's total time - 10
36 + 85 + ? = 170 - 10
121 + ? = 160
The question is asking for James' run time, so we solve for that:
? = 160 - 121
? = 39 minutes

The answer is 39 minutes.

[EXP] 501: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's first find out how many insects David and Bodhi found.  Let's use variables to represent their findings:

D = David's findings
B = Bodhi's findings

The problem states that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write an equation:

D = B/2

The problem also states that Lily found 7 more than David, so we can write another equation:

L = D + 7

We know that the total number of insects collected is 43.  We can write an equation:

L + D + B = 43

Substitute the expressions for L and D from the above equations into this equation:

(L = D + 7) + D + B = 43

Expand the equation:

D + 7 + D + B = 43

Combine like terms:

2D + B + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

2D + B = 36

Now we can solve for B:

B = 36 - 2D

Substitute this expression for B into the equation D = B/2:

D = (36 - 2D)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

2D = 36 - 2D

Add 2D to both sides:

4D = 36

Divide both sides by 4:

D = 9

Now that we know David found 9 insects, we can find out how many Lily found:

L = D + 7
= 9 + 7
= 16

So Lily found 16 insects.

[EXP] 523: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  Let's first find the number of quarts that Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick per hour individually:

Tony: 6 quarts per hour
Bobby: 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour (since Bobby picks one less quart than Tony)
Kathy: 5 x 2 = 10 quarts per hour (since Kathy can pick twice as many as Bobby)
Ricky: 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour (since Ricky picks 2 fewer quarts than Kathy)

Now, we add up the number of quarts that each person can pick per hour:

Tony: 6 quarts
Bobby: 5 quarts
Kathy: 10 quarts
Ricky: 8 quarts

The total number of quarts they can pick per hour is:
6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29

[EXP] 529: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 172, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Ophelia has 20 sofas.  Since they each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we need to find the number of chairs they have. 

Let's call the number of chairs Ophelia has "x".  Then, since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Ophelia has is x - 2. 

Since Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can set up the equation:

x - 2 = 20

To solve for x, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:

x = 22

So Ophelia has 22 chairs. 

Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, which means Jenna has 3 x 22 = 66 chairs. 

Since Jenna has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, the number of sofas Jenna has is 66 - 2 = 64. 

The total number of sofas Ophelia and Jenna have is:

20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) = 84

The total number of chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is:

22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = 88

So, the total number of sofas and chairs Ophelia and Jenna have is 84 sofas and 88 chairs.

Add x to both sides: 2 + x = 400.  Subtract 2 from both sides: x = 398.

The new carpet costs $12 per square foot, so the total cost of the carpet itself is:

The padding costs $2 per square foot, so the cost of padding is:

To find the total cost to replace the carpet, we add up the costs:

According to the note, we know that:

R = B - (1/100)B
G = B + (1/100)B

Adding R, B, and G, we get:
R + B + G = 4500

Substitute the expressions for R and G into the equation:
(B - (1/100)B) + B + (B + (1/100)B) = 4500

Simplify the equation:
3B - (1/100)B = 4500

Multiply both sides by 100 to eliminate the fraction:
300B - B = 450000

Subtract B from both sides:

Divide both sides by 299:

[EXP] 598: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 3 angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  We know that one angle is twice the smallest angle, and one angle is three times the smallest angle.  Let's say the smallest angle is x. 

Then, the other two angles are 2x and 3x. 

The total of the three angles is x + 2x + 3x = 6x. 

We know that the total of the three angles is 180, so 6x = 180. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 6:

x = 180 / 6
x = 30

So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  The other two angles are 2x = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees and 3x = 3 * 30 = 90 degrees. 

The largest angle is 90 degrees.  The answer is 90.

Let the number of sheep be x.  Then, the number of geese is 20 - x, since there are 20 heads in total (20 - x heads are geese). 

Since each sheep has 4 legs, the number of sheep legs is 4x.  Similarly, each goose has 2 legs, so the number of goose legs is 2(20 - x). 

We are told that the total number of animal legs is 70.  So we can set up the equation:

4x + 2(20 - x) = 70

Combine like terms:

4x + 40 - 2x = 70

Simplify:

2x + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2x = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 15

* She also adds 20cm to the bottom with a lace trim. 
* The final design is 140cm long. 

Let's call the original length of the dress "x". 

The extended length would be x + x/2 (since it's 50% of the original length) = 3x/2. 
Then, add the 20cm lace trim to get the final length of 140cm:

3x/2 + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides:

3x/2 = 120

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

3x = 240

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 80

[EXP] 727: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Topher's shoes are 8 feet 4 inches long.  We can convert this to inches by multiplying 8 by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot) to get 96 inches.  Then we add 4 inches to get 100 inches.  

Now, his shoes are 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  So, we can set up an equation:

100 = 9x + 10

We solve this equation by subtracting 10 from both sides to get:

90 = 9x

Then we divide both sides by 9:

10 = x

So one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, so she trades 30 * 0. 9 = 27 small stickers for buttons.  Each small sticker is worth 1 button, so she gets 27 buttons. 

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, so she trades 40 * 0. 5 = 20 large stickers for buttons.  Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets 20 large buttons. 

She trades the rest of her large stickers for small buttons, so she trades 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers for buttons.  Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so she gets 3 * 20 = 60 small buttons. 

To find the total number of buttons she has, she gets 27 + 20 + 60 buttons = 107 buttons. 

The answer is 107.

[EXP] 757: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Let the number of votes against the new regulation be x. 

We know that the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, so the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

The total number of votes on the council is 33. 

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x = 33

Combine like terms:

3x = 33

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 11

So there were 11 votes against the new regulation. 

The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice the number of votes against it, which is:

2x = 2(11) = 22

The answer is 22.

* Total difference in timer: -120 points (because Ava got less points)

The total difference between Ava and Emma's scores is 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 points.  So, Ava is -25 points behind Emma.  

The answer is -25. 
 Voted result:  Let's break down the points for each type of scoring:

* Jumped enemies: Ava gets 8 more enemies than Emma.  So, Ava gets 8 x 10 = 80 points more than Emma. 
* Collected berries: Ava gets 3 more berries than Emma.  So, Ava gets 3 x 5 = 15 points more than Emma. 
* Timer: Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma, which means Emma gets 4 x 30 = 120 points more than Ava. 

To find the total difference between their scores, we need to add the points for each type of scoring:

* Total difference in jumped enemies: 80 points
* Total difference in berries: 15 points
* Total difference in timer: -120 points (because Ava got less points)

The total difference between Ava and Emma's scores is 80 + 15 - 120 = -25 points.  So, Ava is -25 points behind Emma.  

The answer is -25.

[EXP] 784: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Bob started with 7 fish.  3 of the original 7 fish were orange, and 4 were white.  So the ratio of white to orange fish was 4:3.  He added 17 new fish to his pond.  Let's call the number of white fish he bought x.  Since he has twice as many orange fish as white fish, the number of orange fish he bought must be 2x.  

The total number of fish he had after adding the new fish is 7 + 17 = 24.  The total number of orange fish he has after adding the new fish is 3 + 2x = 2(4) + 2x = 8 + 2x, and the total number of white fish he has after adding the new fish is 4 + x.  

We know that the total number of fish is 24, so we can set up the equation 8 + 2x + 4 + x = 24.  Simplifying the equation, we get 12 + 3x = 24, so 3x = 12, and x = 4.  So Bob bought 4 white fish.

1.  First, we need to find out how many miles Andy's car travels in a week.  Since he only uses his car to go to work from Monday to Friday, he travels 5 miles one way, twice a day, which is 10 miles per day.  For 5 days, that's a total of 10 x 5 = 50 miles per week. 

2.  Next, we need to find out how much fuel is consumed in a week.  Since Andy's car has a fuel efficiency of 10 MPG, you can calculate the fuel consumed as follows:

Fuel consumed in a week = Total miles traveled / Fuel efficiency
Fuel consumed in a week = 50 miles / 10 MPG
Fuel consumed in a week = 5 gallons

3.  Finally, we need to find out how much money Andy's car is consuming in a week.  Since the price of gas is $3 per gallon, you can calculate the cost as follows:

Total cost per week = Fuel consumed in a week x Per gallon cost
Total cost per week = 5 gallons x $3/gallon
Total cost per week = $15

So, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

[EXP] 807: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  Let's start by finding the number of third-graders who did not pass:

500 - 340 = 160

So, out of 500 third-graders, 160 did not pass. 

For fourth graders, 40 out of 100 passed.  That means:

100 - 40 = 60

60 out of 100 fourth graders did not pass. 

For fifth graders, the pass rate was twice the fourth grade's pass rate, which is 40%.  Therefore, the pass rate for fifth graders is:

40 * 2 = 80%

So, for the 400 fifth graders, we can expect:

400 * 0. 8 = 320

to have passed.  That means:

400 - 320 = 80

80 did not pass. 

To find the overall pass rate, we need to sum the number of students who passed and then divide it by the total number of students.  First, let's calculate the total number of students:

500 (third-graders) + 100 (fourth-graders) + 400 (fifth-graders) = 1000

Now, let's calculate the total number of students who passed:

340 (third-graders) + 40 (fourth-graders) + 320 (fifth-graders) = 700

Now, we can find the overall pass rate by dividing the number of students who passed by the total number of students:

700 / 1000 = 0. 7

So, the school's overall pass rate is 70%.

Since Jack has 3 friends and they play for 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/2 hours = 1/3 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 3/6 hours = 4 hours, they played for a total of 4 hours.

[EXP] 816: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

We know that Tanya uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance.  This means the zest and fragrance together take up some amount of the 10-ounce jar.  Let's call this amount x. 

We also know that Tanya uses the same amount of salt as sugar.  This means the salt and sugar together take up the same amount of space as the zest and fragrance, or x. 

Since the zest is used in the same proportion as the fragrance, we know that the zest takes up half of this amount, x / 2. 

Similarly, since the salt is used in twice the proportion as the zest, it takes up 2 * (x / 2) or just x. 

Now, we know that the oil takes up twice as much space as the salt.  So it takes up 2x. 

Since all these ingredients together fill the 10-ounce jar, we can set up the equation: x + x + x + 2x = 10

Combine like terms: 6x = 10

Divide both sides by 6: x = 10/6 = 5/3

So the zest, fragrance, salt, and sugar together take up 5/3 ounces. 

The oil takes up twice as much as the salt, so it takes up 2x = 2(5/3) = 10/3 ounces. 

The answer is 10/3 ounces.

Smendrick = 3 x PJ

We don't know how many cards PJ has, so let's call that number x.  Then:

Smendrick = 3x

We're also given that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:

Becca = Smendrick + 12
= 3x + 12

We know that the total number of cards is 341:

Becca + Smendrick + PJ = 341

Substitute the expressions we found for Becca and Smendrick:

(3x + 12) + 3x + x = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards.  Since Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, Smendrick has:

Smendrick = 3x = 3(47) = 141

This means we can write an equation:\n\nSmendrick = 3 x PJ\n\nWe don't know how many cards PJ has, so let's call that number x.  Then:\n\nSmendrick = 3x\n\nWe're also given that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:\n\nBecca = Smendrick + 12\n= 3x + 12\n\nWe know that the total number of cards is 341:\n\nBecca + Smendrick + PJ = 341\n\nSubstitute the expressions we found for Becca and Smendrick:\n\n(3x + 12) + 3x + x = 341\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n7x + 12 = 341\n\nSubtract 12 from both sides:\n\n7x = 329\n\nDivide both sides by 7:\n\nx = 47\n\nSo PJ has 47 cards.  Since Smendrick has 3 times as many cards as PJ, Smendrick has:\n\nSmendrick = 3x = 3(47) = 141\n\nBecca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has:\n\nBecca = Smendrick + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153\n\nThe answer is 153.

* She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, so she had 5 x 2 = 10 blue eggs. 
* She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs. 
* She had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, so she had 9 ÷ 3 = 3 yellow eggs. 

Now, let's count the total number of eggs:
5 (green) + 10 (blue) + 9 (pink) + 3 (yellow) = 27

[EXP] 910: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.  We can set up an equation:

Duncan's age 8 years ago = 2 x Adam's age 4 years ago

Since Duncan is currently 60 years old, we can write an equation to represent Duncan's current age and age 8 years ago:

60 = Duncan's age now

60 - 8 = Duncan's age 8 years ago

52 = Duncan's age 8 years ago

Now we can substitute this value into the original equation:

52 = 2 x Adam's age 4 years ago

Divide both sides by 2:

26 = Adam's age 4 years ago

Since Adam's age 4 years ago is 26, we can find his current age by adding 4:

Adam's current age = 26 + 4
= 30

Finally, to find Adam's age in 8 years, we can add 8 to his current age:

Adam's age in 8 years = 30 + 8
= 38

The answer is 38.

[EXP] 932: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can write an equation:

Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than John, so we can write:

Paul's age = John's age + 10

Now, we're given that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.  We can write an equation:

Peter's age + Paul's age + John's age = 100

Substituting the equation for Peter's age (Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age) into the equation above, we get:

(Paul's age + John's age) + Paul's age + John's age = 100

Combine like terms:

2(Paul's age + John's age) = 100

Divide both sides by 2:

Paul's age + John's age = 50

Now we can substitute the equation Paul's age = John's age + 10 into this equation:

John's age + 10 + John's age = 50

Combine like terms:

2John's age + 10 = 50

Subtract 10 from both sides:

2John's age = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

John's age = 20

Now that we know John's age, we can find Paul's age:

Paul's age = John's age + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:

Peter's age = Paul's age + John's age = 30 + 20 = 50

So, Peter's age is 50 years old.

[EXP] 964: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 147, [output]: 339 Pokemon were caught altogether.  Alex has caught 5 more than Stan.  Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe.  So if we call the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught "x", then Stan has caught 4x - 13. 

The total number of Pokemon caught is the sum of the Pokemon caught by Adelwolfe, Stan, and Alex.  Since Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, we can express the total as x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 13 + 5). 

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

x + 4x - 13 + 4x - 13 + 5 = 339

Combine the x terms and the constant terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can find Stan's catch by using the formula: Stan has caught 4x - 13.  Substitute x = 40:

Stan has caught 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147

[EXP] 985: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 342, [output]:  Let's calculate the total width of the flowers once they are planted.  Pat's flowers are 12 inches wide, and she needs to leave 1. 5 feet (18 inches) between each plant.  

To find the total width of the flowers, calculate the total distance between flowers: 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches.  Since we need to know the total inches in the flower bed, multiply by the number of flowers: 30 inches x 18 (because there are 18 spaces) = 540 inches.  Since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches, divide by 12: 540 inches / 12 inches per foot = 45 feet.  

Now that we know the width of the flowers, subtract it from the length of the flower bed to find the distance remaining: 111 feet (length) - 45 feet (width of flowers) = 66 feet.  

Now, divide this remaining distance by the space between the flowers (18 inches) to find the spaces left for planting: 66 feet * 12 inches per foot = 792 inches.  792 inches / 18 inches = 44 spaces.  Since Pat already owns 17 flowers, that leaves 44 - 17 = 27 spaces.  

Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store, and Pat will need to buy 27 additional flowers.  The total amount of money Pat will need to spend is: 27 flowers * $6 per flower = $162.

When the air conditioner was running on low (3 hours), it cooled the room by 3 x 2 = 6 degrees per hour.  Since it ran for 3 hours, the total cooling effect would be 6 x 3 = 18 degrees. 

Then, the air conditioner was turned up to high and ran for 4 hours.  At high, it cooled the room by 4 x 3 = 12 degrees per hour.  Since it ran for 4 hours, the total cooling effect from high speed would be 12 x 4 = 48 degrees. 

After the 4 hours at high speed, the air conditioner was turned off for 2 hours.  During this time, the room would warm up by 2 x 2 = 4 degrees per hour.  Since it was off for 2 hours, the room warmed up by 4 x 2 = 8 degrees. 

Now, let's add up the cooling effects: 18 (low) + 48 (high) = 66 degrees.  Then, subtract the 8 degrees the room warmed up: 66 - 8 = 58 degrees.

[EXP] 1003: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Lisa sold 3 1/2 boxes and Peter sold 4 1/2 boxes, so together they sold 3 1/2 + 4 1/2 = 8 boxes.  They sold 64 chocolate bars in total, so we can set up the equation:
3 1/2 x + 4 1/2 x = 64

First, we can convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions:
(7/2 x + 9/2 x = 64)

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fractions:
7x + 9x = 128

Combine like terms:
16x = 128

Divide both sides by 16:
x = 8

So there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.

The final 3 hours, the battery lost 7% of the capacity each hour.  So, in those 3 hours, it lost 3 * 7 = 21% of its initial charge.  So, the initial charge before those 3 hours was 28 - 21 = 7% higher than the ending charge, which is 100 * 7 / 100 = 7. 

Now, let's go back to 5 hours ago.  The battery was losing 9% of its capacity each hour.  It lost 5 * 9 = 45% of its initial charge in those 5 hours.  So, the initial charge before those 5 hours was 45% higher than the original ending charge, which is 28.  So, the initial charge was 28 * 145 / 100 = 40.

8x + 12x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide by 20:

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals and 2 x 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The problem says that the prices are proportional.  In math, when you multiply the number of items by a constant to get the new price, that's called a proportion.  

Here, the package with 2 sandwiches costs 3 dollars and the package with 4 sandwiches costs 6 dollars.  If we multiply the number of sandwiches by 2 (4 / 2 = 2) we get from 2 to 4, we also multiply the price by 2 (3 x 2 = 6).  

If we continue this pattern, to go from 2 sandwiches to 8 sandwiches, we multiply 2 by 4, but we also multiply the price by 4.  

If the price for 4 sandwiches is 6 dollars, the price for 8 sandwiches is 6 x 2 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12.

1.  Jim's income before college was $25,000 per year.  With the college degree, his income triples to $25,000 x 3 = $75,000 per year. 
2.  Jim takes 4 years to finish college and gets $50,000 in loans each year, so the total amount of loans is 4 x $50,000 = $200,000. 
3.  Since Jim's income increased threefold, he earns $75,000 per year instead of the $25,000 he would have earned if he didn't go to college.  So, the amount of money he didn't earn during those 4 years is $25,000 x 4 = $100,000. 
4.  Now, Jim needs to pay off the $200,000 in loans and earn back the $100,000 to make up for the lost income.  The total amount is $200,000 + $100,000 = $300,000. 

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn this amount, we can divide the total amount by his annual income after college: $300,000 ÷ $75,000 = 4 years. 

Therefore, it will take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.

[EXP] 1048: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Let the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set be x. 
Since Rory retrieved 4 more balls in the first set, the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4. 

In the third set, Rory retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved (1/2)x balls. 

In total, Rory retrieved 19 balls.  So, we can set up the equation:

(x) + (x + 4) + (1/2)x = 19

Simplify the equation:

(3/2)x + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

(3/2)x = 15

Divide both sides by (3/2):

x = 10

So, the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set is 10. 

To find the number of tennis balls retrieved in the first set, we add 4 to x:

(10) + 4 = 14

Rory retrieved 14 tennis balls in the first set.

So in 2010, the price will have decreased by 3 years.  To find the amount of depreciation, we first need to calculate 21% of 20000.  0. 21 * 20000 = 4200.  So, the price decreases by 4200 each year.  3 times 4200 is 12600.  After 3 years, the price will be 20000 - 12600 = 7400.

We know that half of the total 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes were sold.  We also know that 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, so 300 x 15% = 45 BMX bikes were sold.  To find the number of MTB bikes sold, we subtract the Trekking and BMX bikes from the total number of bikes sold: 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes were sold. 

Next, we can find the total revenue from the sold bikes by multiplying the number of each type of bike sold by its price.  For Trekking bikes, the revenue is 150 x $450 = $67,500.  For BMX bikes, the revenue is 45 x $250 = $11,250 (since BMX bikes are half the price of MTB bikes, which are $500).  For MTB bikes, the revenue is 105 x $500 = $52,500.  The total revenue is the sum of these three: $67,500 + $11,250 + $52,500 = $131,250.

Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, the distance between them is the sum of the distances they travel: 180 + 90 = 270 miles. 

Therefore, after 3 hours, the trains are 270 miles apart.

The problem says that 6 jellyfish changed color.  Since this is the same as the number of large jellyfish that change color, we can set up the equation:

x/15 = 6

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by 15:

x = 6 * 15
x = 90

The second part of the problem states that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.  Let's call Wendy's current age w.  In 25 years, Colin will be x + 25, and he will be a third as old as Wendy is now, so (x + 25) = w/3. 

Now, let's use the first sentence to express Wendy's current age in terms of Colin's current age: 5(x + 7) = w.  We can substitute w/3 from the second sentence into this equation: 5(x + 7) = w = 3(x + 25). 

Now, we can solve for x.  First, we subtract x from both sides of the equation: 5x + 35 = 3x + 75.  Then, we subtract 3x from both sides: 2x + 35 = 75.  Subtract 35 from both sides: 2x = 40.  Finally, divide both sides by 2: x = 20.

[EXP] 1198: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

John buys 10 bottles of scotch for $600.  To find the cost per bottle of scotch, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

$600 ÷ 10 = $60 per bottle of scotch

He buys twice as many bottles of cognac, which means he buys 2 x 10 = 20 bottles of cognac. 

The cost of cognac is 50% more than scotch, so we need to add 50% to the cost of scotch to get the cost of cognac:

$60 + (50% of $60) = $60 + $30 = $90 per bottle of cognac

Now, we can find the total cost of cognac:

20 bottles of cognac × $90 per bottle = $1800

To find the total cost of everything, we add the cost of scotch and cognac:

$600 (scotch) + $1800 (cognac) = $2400

So, John spends $2400 on everything.

The length of the longer piece is 4 times the shorter piece, so it's 4x.  We know the total length of the original board is 40, so the length of the two pieces combined is 40.  We can set up an equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide by 5:

x = 8

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long.  The longer piece is 4x, which is 4 * 8 = 32.  The answer is 32.

[EXP] 1277: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  James's backyard fence is a rectangle with a long side of 20 feet and a short side of 15 feet.  The perimeter of the rectangle is the distance around the fence.  Since it's a rectangle, the formula to find the perimeter is:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length (long side) and w is the width (short side).  Plugging in the values, we get:

Perimeter = 2(20 + 15)
= 2(35)
= 70 feet

So James needs 70 feet of crepe paper to hang around his fence.

We can use algebra to solve this problem.  Let's say the age of the older brother is x.  Since the younger brother is 12, half of the older brother's age, we can set up the equation:

12 = x/2

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:

24 = x

So, the older brother is 24 years old.  The total age of the siblings is:

2 brothers = 12 + 24 = 36
3 sisters = 16 x 3 = 48

Adding the ages of the siblings together gives:

[EXP] 1311: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information given: Vanessa ran 4 miles, and Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.  Since Aaron is twice as fast as Vanessa, Aaron must have run half the distance Vanessa ran, which is 4/2 = 2 miles.  Since Aaron took 16 minutes to run 2 miles, Vanessa must have taken 2 times that amount to run 4 miles. 

16 minutes to run 2 miles means that Aaron's speed is 2 miles per 16 minutes, or 1/8 miles per minute. 

Vanessa's speed is half of that, which is (1/8) / 2 = 1/16 miles per minute. 

To complete 4 miles, Vanessa would need:

[EXP] 1314: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  First, let's find the amount sold to get a profit of 25%.  The profit is the difference between the selling price and the original cost.  Let's call the selling price 'x'.  Then the profit = x - 80. 

The problem tells us that the profit is 25% of 80, so we have:

x - 80 = 25% of 80

To find the selling price, we add 80 to both sides of the equation:

x = 80 + 25% of 80

To find 25% of 80, multiply 80 by 0. 25:

x = 80 + 20

x = 100

So the fruit vendor sold each watermelon for $100.

Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of legs of the chickens is 2n.  Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of legs of the cows is 4(20 - n).  Since the total number of legs is 70, we can set up the equation:

2n + 4(20 - n) = 70

Let's simplify this equation:

2n + 80 - 4n = 70

Combine like terms:

-2n = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

n = 5

So there are 5 chickens.  Since there are 20 animals in total, the number of cows is 20 - 5 = 15.

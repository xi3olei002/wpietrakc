The football team played 22 games.  They won 8 more than they lost.  This means that the number of wins plus the number of losses equals 22, and the difference between the number of wins and losses is 8. 

Let's say the number of losses is x.  Then the number of wins is x + 8. 

We can write an equation based on this information: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So the team lost 7 games. 

The number of wins is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Since Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, we can calculate Mary's age as:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now we know the ages of the three girls: Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23.

32 (snails in larger aquarium) - 4 (snails in smaller aquarium) = 28

This means that there is a difference of 28 snails between the two aquariums.  The problem states that this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  Let's call the number of fish in both aquariums "x".  We can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 ÷ 2
x = 14

This means that there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

[EXP] 56: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 52 is the total number of choir members.  50% of 52 is 26 boys.  So the remaining members must be girls.  52 - 26 = 26, so there are 26 girls. 

26 girls from the choir are going to perform.  Half of those can't make it, so the number of girls who don't make it is 26/2 = 13.  That means 26 - 13 = 13 girls can make it to the show. 

Then, the 3 choir teachers will also be performing.  The total number of people performing will be the 13 girls that showed up and the 3 teachers, so 13 + 3 = 16.  The answer is 16.

[EXP] 57: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 60 - 10 - (10 + 10 - 20%) = ?

Let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after the discount:

10 + 10 - (20% of 20) = 10 + 10 - 4 = 16

Tim will now pay $10 for Netflix, $16 for Hulu and Disney Plus, totaling $26. 

So, by canceling his cable package and switching to streaming services, Tim will save:

60 - 26 = 34

The answer is 34.

The football team played 22 games.  They won 8 more than they lost.  This means that the number of wins plus the number of losses equals 22, and the difference between the number of wins and losses is 8. 

Let's say the number of losses is x.  Then the number of wins is x + 8. 

We can write an equation based on this information: x + (x + 8) = 22

Combine like terms: 2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides: 2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2: x = 7

So the team lost 7 games. 

The number of wins is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 3 friends spent 20. 25 on tickets.  Then they spent 4. 50 less on food than on the tickets.  So they spent 20. 25 - 4. 50 = 15. 75 on food.  The 3 tickets and food costed in total 20. 25 + 15. 75 = 36.  They also went on 2 rides, which costs 33 for each ride.  So the cost for the rides is 2 x 33 = 66.  The total cost is 36 + 66 = 102.  If the cost is split between 3 friends, then each of them pays 102 / 3 = 34.  The answer is 34.

So, the total number of pounds of carrots given out will be 2 x 40 = 80 pounds.  The number of pounds not used will be the difference between the original 200 pounds and the 80 pounds given out: 200 - 80 = 120.  The answer is 120.

[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Carl used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, and he ate a sandwich every day this week.  So he ate 2 x 7 = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.  

Then, he ate cheese and egg omelets for 3 days, using 1 more slice per omelet than per sandwich.  So, for omelets, he used 3 x (2 + 1) = 3 x 3 = 9 slices of cheese. 

Finally, he used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese dish. 

In total, Carl used 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.  The answer is 31.

[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  First, we calculate the total amount Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes.  A jacket for 30 dollars, and 2 pairs of shoes for 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  So in total, she will spend 30 + 40 = 70.  If she already has 10, she will need to earn 70 - 10 = 60 dollars more.  She earns 5 dollars for each time she babysits and 4 dollars for each time she mows the lawn.  She babysits the neighbor's kids 4 times, earning 4 x 5 = 20 dollars.  So she still needs 60 - 20 = 40.  Since she earns 4 dollars for each time she mows the lawn, she will need to mow the lawn 40/4 = 10 times.

[EXP] 35: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Let's first determine the age of Joan and Mary based on the given information. 

Since Jessa is 20 years old, and Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, we can calculate Joan's age as:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5
Joan's age = 20 + 5
Joan's age = 25

Since Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, we can calculate Mary's age as:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2
Mary's age = 25 - 2
Mary's age = 23

Now we know the ages of the three girls: Jessa is 20, Joan is 25, and Mary is 23. 

To find the sum of their ages, we add:

20 + 25 + 23 = 68

The sum of the ages of the three girls is 68.

[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7, [output]:  We can start by finding the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums.  We can do this by subtracting the number of snails in the smaller aquarium from the number of snails in the larger aquarium:

32 (snails in larger aquarium) - 4 (snails in smaller aquarium) = 28

This means that there is a difference of 28 snails between the two aquariums.  The problem states that this difference is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.  Let's call the number of fish in both aquariums "x".  We can set up the equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28 รท 2
x = 14

This means that there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Andrea has 52 apples.  Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, Jamal must have 52 - 8 = 44 apples. 

We are also given that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas. 

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so she has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas. 

To find the total number of fruits, we add the number of apples and bananas for both people:

Andrea's fruits: 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76
Jamal's fruits: 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92

In total, there are 76 + 92 = 168 fruits.  The answer is 168.

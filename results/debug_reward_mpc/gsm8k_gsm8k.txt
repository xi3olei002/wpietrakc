[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70000, [output]:  Josh started with a house worth 80000.  After 50000 in repairs, the house increased in value by 150%.  150% of 80000 is 150/100 * 80000 = 120000.  So the house is now worth 80000 + 120000 = 200000.  Josh spent 80000 + 50000 = 130000.  He made 200000 - 130000 = 70000 in profit.  The answer is 70000.

[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]:  We are given that Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/min.  So, downloading 200 GB would normally take 200 / 2 = 100 minutes. 

Since Carla has to restart the download, let's calculate how much time she wasted waiting for the restart: The download was completed 40% of the way, so it took Carla 40% * 100 minutes = 40 minutes to reach that point.  Then the Windows restart took 20 more minutes.  So, in total, Carla wasted 60 minutes.  But now, she has to restart from the beginning.   She already downloaded 40% of 200 GB, which is 80 GB.   So now she needs to download 200 - 80 = 120 GB.  At her normal speed, it would take her 120 / 2 = 60 minutes.  But then we must add the time she wasted waiting for the restart, so the total time will be 60 + 60 = 120 minutes.  The answer is 120.

[EXP] 9: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.  3 hours at 60 mph means he has traveled 3 x 60 = 180 miles away from home. 

Then, he tries to get home in 4 hours.  He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, which means he doesn't move at all during that time. 

Then, he drives at 30 mph for half an hour.  When you go 30 miles per hour for half an hour, you go 15 miles.  So, after this, he has gone 15 + 180 = 195 miles.  But we still have 4 hours left, and he'll be going 80 mph during those next 2 hours. 2 hours at 80 mph means he'll go 2 x 80 = 160 miles.  

Total distance so far is 195 miles.  We are looking for how many miles away he is from home.  If he went away 195 miles and then goes back 160 miles, he will be 195 - 160 = 35 miles away from home.  The answer is 35.

After reducing 30% in the third month, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and subtract that from 180.  30% of 180 is 30/100 x 180 = 54.   So 180 - 54 = 126 downloads in the third month.  In total, the program had 60 + 180 + 126 = 366 downloads.  The answer is 366.

[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Melanie started with some unknown number of vacuum cleaners.  Let's call this number x. 

She sold a third of the vacuum cleaners at the green house.  A third of x is x/3.  After selling x/3 vacuum cleaners, she was left with x - (x/3) = 2x/3 vacuum cleaners.  
She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, which left her with 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners.  
She then sold half of what was left at the orange house.  She had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners, and half of that is (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1.   After selling this, Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners left.   

So, x/3 - 1 = 5.   We need to solve for x. 

To start, add 1 to both sides of the equation: x/3 = 6.  Then multiply both sides by 3: x = 18.  The answer is 18.

[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 125, [output]:  lets consider the jewelry option first.  The jewelry is worth $5,000 initially.  If it goes up 2. 5%, then it will be worth $5,000 x (1 + 0. 025) = $5,125.  So the profit would be $5,125 - $5,000 = $125.  Now let's consider the electronic gadgets option.   These are worth $8,000 initially.  If they go up 1. 2%, they will be worth $8,000 x (1 + 0. 012) = $8,064.   So the profit would be $8,064 - $8,000 = $64.  Since 125 is greater than 64, the merchant should choose the jewelry option.   The answer is $125.

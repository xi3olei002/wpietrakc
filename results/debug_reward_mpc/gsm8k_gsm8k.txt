[EXP] 25: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 25% off means that Kyle got 75% of the original price.  Let's call the original price "x".  Then 0. 75x = 19. 50.  To find x, we divide both sides by 0. 75.  x = 19. 50 / 0. 75 = 26.  The answer is 26.

[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start by calculating how much Marie spent on the food items she ordered.  The chicken meal costs $12, the 5 packs of milk cost 5 x 3 = $15, and the 4 apples cost 4 x 1. 5 = $6.  So, the total cost of the food items is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.  Since Marie paid a total of $50, she must have spent $50 - $33 = $17 on the boxes of pizza.  If each box of pizza costs $8. 50, then Marie must have ordered 17 / 8. 5 = 2 boxes of pizza.

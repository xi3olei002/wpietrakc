[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]: 200 GB is the total size of the file. Carla can download 2 GB per minute. So, it would take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the file normally.

But, 40% of the way through the download, she has to restart the download. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. So, she has downloaded 80 GB before the restart.

After the restart, she has to download the remaining 200 - 80 = 120 GB. Since she can download 2 GB per minute, it will take her 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.

So, the total time it takes to download the file is the time it takes to download the first 80 GB plus the time it takes to download the remaining 120 GB. The time to download the first 80 GB is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes. The time to download the remaining 120 GB is 60 minutes. So, the total time is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.

[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Let's work backwards to find out how many she started with.

Let's say she started with x vacuum cleaners.

She sold a third of them at the green house, which is x/3.

She sold 2 more at the red house, so she has x - x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.

Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, half of what was left is 5.

So, we can set up the equation:

x - x/3 - 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can add x/3 to both sides:

x - 2 = 5 + x/3

Then, we can subtract x from both sides:

-2 = 5 + x/3 - x

Combine like terms:

-2 = 5 - 2x/3

Add 2 to both sides:

-2 + 2 = 5 - 2x/3 + 2

0 = 7 - 2x/3

Add 2x/3 to both sides:

2x/3 = 7

Multiply both sides by 3:

2x = 21

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 10.5

So, Melanie started with 10.5 vacuum cleaners.

Darrell's age : Allen's age = 7 : 11

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by a common multiple of 7 and 11, which is 77:

77(Darrell's age) = 77(7)

Darrell's age = 49

Now we can find Allen's age by subtracting Darrell's age from the total age:

Allen's age = Total age - Darrell's age
= 162 - 49
= 113

Now, to find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

Allen's age 10 years from now = 113 + 10

We know that the total number of coins is 110, so we can set up the equation:

Combine like terms:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 40

So, the number of silver coins is 40. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins is:

[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Dana can skip at 3 miles per hour. Since she can skip at a rate that is half as fast as she can run, we can set up an equation:

Running speed = 2 x Skipping speed
Running speed = 2 x 3
Running speed = 6 miles per hour

So, Dana can run at a rate of 6 miles per hour.

Next, we know that she can walk at a rate that is one-fourth of her running speed:

Walking speed = Running speed / 4
Walking speed = 6 / 4
Walking speed = 1.5 miles per hour

Now, we know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. So, in six hours, she will run for two hours and walk for four hours.

Time running = 2 hours
Distance running = Speed x Time = 6 x 2 = 12 miles

Time walking = 4 hours
Distance walking = Speed x Time = 1.5 x 4 = 6 miles

Total distance traveled = Distance running + Distance walking = 12 + 6 = 18 miles

The answer is 18.

For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40, so 4 x 40 = 160 dollars. In total, the mechanic earned 360 + 160 = 520 dollars on Thursday. On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn't repair any truck tires. For each car tire, the mechanic charges $40, so 12 x 40 = 480 dollars. The mechanic earned 480 dollars on Friday. The mechanic earned 520 dollars on Thursday and 480 dollars on Friday. To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to subtract the revenue earned on the day with lower revenue from the revenue earned on the day with higher revenue. The day with higher revenue is Friday, so we need to subtract the revenue earned on Thursday from the revenue earned on Friday. 480 - 520 = -40. The mechanic earned $40 less on the day with higher revenue.

[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Frankie watched TV for 7 hours in total. 

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour show, so that is 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched 1 hour and 30 minutes of TV, so that is 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched 2 episodes of 1-hour show, so that is 2 hours. 

In total, he watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of TV. Since he watched 7 hours in total, he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours of 30-minute shows. 

Since 1.5 hours is equal to 3 30-minute episodes, Frankie watched 3 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday. The answer is 3.

[EXP] 142: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 400, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees. Let's say the number of baby bees is x. Then the number of worker bees is 2x.

We also know that there are twice as many babies as queens, so the number of queens is x/2.

The total number of bees is 700, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 700

Combine like terms:

3.5x = 700

Divide both sides by 3.5:

x = 200

Now that we know the number of baby bees is 200, we can find the number of worker bees:

Number of worker bees = 2x = 2(200) = 400

Dave ate 14 french fries initially.

The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, which is 14/2 = 7 french fries.

So, the total number of french fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21.

The three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so they ate a total of 3 x 3 = 9 french fries.

The remaining french fries after the pigeons ate are 21 - 9 = 12.

The raccoon ate two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is 12 x 2/3 = 8 french fries.

So, the remaining fries after the raccoon ate are 12 - 8 = 4.

Finally, ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 4 - 1 = 3 french fries.

To find the original number of french fries in the pack, we add up the number of fries eaten and the number of fries left:

21 (eaten by Dave and seagull) + 3 (left after ants) = 24

So, there were 24 french fries in the pack when Dave bought it.

The sum of their ages in 2 years will be the sum of their current ages plus 2. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + 2 = 28

Combine like terms:

First, let's find out how much they spent on lemons and sugar. They make a gallon of lemonade and sell 20 glasses. Each glass is sold for $0.50, so they make $10 per gallon. They make a profit of $25, so they must have spent $25 less than they made. $10 - $25 = -$15. They lost $15, which means they spent $15 on lemons and sugar.

Since it costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, we can set up an equation: 3x + 2x = -15. Combine like terms: 5x = -15. Divide both sides by 5: x = -3.

So they spent $3 on lemons. The answer is 3.

* Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
* She ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations.

Let's say the number of white carnations is x. Then, the number of red roses is 4x, and the number of pink calla lilies is 5x.

We know that the total number of flowers is the sum of the number of white carnations, red roses, and pink calla lilies:

x + 4x + 5x = 200

Combine like terms:

10x = 200

Divide both sides by 10:

x = 20

So, the number of white carnations is 20. The number of red roses is 4x = 4(20) = 80. The number of pink calla lilies is 5x = 5(20) = 100.

To keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 80 red roses by 5 pm.

[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

The trader buys the bags of wheat at a rate of $20 per bag, so the total cost of buying the bags is unknown number of bags x $20 = $20x.

The cost of transporting each bag is $2, so the total cost of transportation is unknown number of bags x $2 = $2x.

The trader sells the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the total revenue is unknown number of bags x $30 = $30x.

The trader made a total profit of $400, so the profit is the revenue minus the cost: $30x - ($20x + $2x) = $400.

Simplifying the equation, we get: $30x - $22x = $400.

Combine like terms: $8x = $400.

Divide both sides by 8: x = $400/8 = 50.

So the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

[EXP] 206: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 98, [output]: 93 is the target average. There are 6 tests in total. 5 tests have been taken, so the average of the 6 tests will be the average of the 5 tests plus the 6th test. The average of the 5 tests is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 438 / 5 = 87.6. To get an average of 93, the average of the 6 tests must be 93. So the average of the 6 tests is 93. The 6th test score is 93 - 87.6 = 5.4. The answer is 6.

[EXP] 215: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water. Then the big pool had 2x gallons of water. Now, both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, so in 4 minutes, they lost 4x + 8x = 12x gallons of water. 

Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So the big pool has 4x gallons of water and the small pool has x gallons of water. 

The total water lost is 12x, so the total water initially was 4x + x = 5x. 

The big pool had 2x initially, so the small pool had 5x - 2x = 3x gallons initially. 

Since 4 minutes passed, the small pool lost 4 gallons of water. So it has 3x - 4 gallons of water now. The answer is 3x - 4.

In total, Sue ate 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

To find out how many calories Sue consumed, we multiply the number of cookies she ate by the number of calories per cookie. Sue ate 46 cookies, and each cookie has 200 calories, so Sue consumed 46 x 200 = 9200 calories.

Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday, for a total of 5 + 13 = 18 cookies. Her sister consumed 18 x 200 = 3600 calories.

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls, the total number of boys and girls is equal. Let's find the number of girls first. The first class has 15 girls, and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls is 15 + 12 = 27.

Since the total number of students is 60, and the number of girls is 27, the number of boys is also 27. Now, let's find the number of boys in the third class. Since the total number of boys is 27, and the third class has 20 students, the number of boys in the third class is 27 - (number of boys in the first two classes).

The first class has 20 students, and 15 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the first class is 20 - 15 = 5. The second class has 20 students, and 12 of them are girls, so the number of boys in the second class is 20 - 12 = 8.

The total number of boys in the first two classes is 5 + 8 = 13. Since the total number of boys is 27, the number of boys in the third class is 27 - 13 = 14. The answer is 14.

[EXP] 279: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's first find Mico and Marco's current ages. Since the sum of their ages is 20, we can set up the equation:

Mico's age + Marco's age = 20

Let's say Mico's age is x. Then Marco's age would be 20 - x.

Mico's age + Marco's age = 20
x + (20 - x) = 20
x + 20 - x = 20
20 = 20

This equation is true, so Mico's age is any number that satisfies the equation. Let's say Mico is 10 years old. Then Marco would be 20 - 10 = 10 years old.

In 10 years, Mico will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old, and Marco will be 10 + 10 = 20 years old. The sum of their ages in 10 years will be:

The problem also states that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam. So, we can set up an equation:

Ruby's age in 9 years = 3 × Sam's age in 9 years

Ruby's age in 9 years = 6x + 9
3 × Sam's age in 9 years = 3(x + 9)

We can simplify the equation:

6x + 9 = 3x + 27

Subtract 3x from both sides:

3x + 9 = 27

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 18

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 6

So, Sam's current age is 6 years old.

Time = 8 hours

Now, we know that the car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, which is 30 miles/hour (60 / 2 = 30). To find the time it took the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance, we can divide the distance by the speed:

Time = 16 hours

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

In the second year, she sold half as many books as she did in the first year, so she sold x/2 books. After the second year, she had 50 books left, which means she sold 250 - x - x/2 = 250 - 3x/2 books in total.

We know that she sold 45 books this year, so 250 - 3x/2 = 45. We can solve for x:

250 - 3x/2 = 45
250 = 3x/2 + 45
250 - 45 = 3x/2
205 = 3x/2
2*205 = 3x
410 = 3x
x = 410/3
x = 136.67

Since you can't sell a fraction of a book, we'll round x to 136. So, Elise sold 136 books in the first year.

In the second year, she sold half as many books, which is 136/2 = 68 books.

Each book sells for 20 dollars, so Elise earned 68 * 20 = 1360 dollars in the second year.

The answer is 1360.

[EXP] 315: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 30, [output]: 105 is the total number of players. Let's start by using the information that there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense. Let's call the number of players on the defense "x". Then the number of players on the offense is 2x.

We also know that the number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense. So the number of players on the special teams is x/2.

The total number of players is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. So we can set up the equation:

x + 2x + x/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

4.5x = 105

Divide both sides by 4.5:

x = 23.33

Since you can't have a fraction of a player, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. So the number of players on the defense is 23.

The answer is 23.

Job A:
Gross pay: $15/hour * 2000 hours = $30,000
Tax: 20% of $30,000 = $6,000
Net pay: $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000

Job B:
Gross pay: $42,000
Property tax: $6,000
Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000
Tax: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600
Net pay: $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400

To find the difference in net pay, subtract the net pay of Job A from the net pay of Job B:

$32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400

[EXP] 360: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Billy started with 10 dollars. He bought candy for 1.5 dollars per pound. Let's call the number of pounds he bought "x". Then he spent 1.5x dollars on candy. He has 10 - 1.5x dollars left. He then took half of this amount and spent it on gumballs. Since gumballs cost 0.05 dollars each, he bought 40 gumballs, so he spent 0.05 * 40 = 2 dollars on gumballs. Half of his remaining money is 0.5 * (10 - 1.5x) = 5 - 0.75x. This amount is equal to 2 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

5 - 0.75x = 2

Subtract 5 from both sides:

-0.75x = -3

Divide both sides by -0.75:

x = 4

So Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.

[EXP] 361: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This means that Carver's age is 2x - 5, where x is his son's age. We know that Carver is 45 years old, so we can set up the equation:

2x - 5 = 45

To solve for x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

2x = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50/2
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.

[EXP] 364: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, John drives to his friend's house. The distance is 200 miles, and his speed is 70 mph. To find the time it takes, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 200 miles / 70 mph
Time = 2.86 hours (approximately)

However, he took a detour that added 10 miles to his trip. So, the actual distance he drove to his friend's house is 200 + 10 = 210 miles.

Now, let's recalculate the time it took to get to his friend's house:

Time = 210 miles / 70 mph
Time = 3 hours

After he gets there, he takes a route home that is 240 miles, but he goes 80 mph. To find the time it takes to get home, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 240 miles / 80 mph
Time = 3 hours

Since he already spent 3 hours getting to his friend's house, the total time it takes for the entire trip is:

Total Time = Time to get to friend's house + Time to get home
Total Time = 3 hours + 3 hours
Total Time = 6 hours

The answer is 6 hours.

This means that the amount of land he had left is 12.8 hectares, which is equal to 3/5 of the original amount.

To find the original amount, we can set up an equation:

3/5 x = 12.8

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

3x = 12.8 x 5
3x = 64

Next, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 64 / 3
x = 21.33

So, Mr. Ruther had 21.33 hectares of land at first.

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. We can set up an equation:

So, Betty has 5x = 5(15) = 75 popsicles, and Sam has 6x = 6(15) = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has:

2. Next, we need to find out how many words Toby can read in 60 minutes. Since he can read 300 words per minute, we can multiply 60 x 300 = 18000 words.

3. Since Toby has to finish the book, we need to find out how many words he still needs to read. We can subtract the number of words he has already read from the total number of words in the book: 9000 - 18000 = 0.

4. Since Toby has already read the entire book, he can leave immediately. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport, so we need to subtract that from the 60 minutes he had available: 60 - 10 = 50.

5. Toby will be 50 minutes early.

[EXP] 410: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 168000, [output]: 40 employees were hired in May. Each employee worked 40 hours a week, and was paid $15 per hour. So the total amount paid to employees in May is 40 * 40 * 15 = 24,000 dollars. In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 1/4 * 40 = 10 employees left. So 30 employees were left. Each employee worked 40 hours a week, and was paid $15 per hour. So the total amount paid to employees in June is 30 * 40 * 15 = 18,000 dollars. The total amount paid to employees in the two months is 24,000 + 18,000 = 42,000 dollars. The answer is 42,000.

[EXP] 411: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Sally started with 10 dollars. She bought 2 pounds of taffy. The first pound costs 3 dollars, and the second pound is 1.5 dollars off, so it costs 3 - 1.5 = 1.5 dollars. So the total cost of taffy is 3 + 1.5 = 4.5 dollars. She also bought a mixed bag of seashells for 1.5 dollars and 4 magnets for 0.25 dollars each, so that is 4 x 0.25 = 1 dollar. So the total cost of the other items is 1.5 + 1 = 2.5 dollars. The total cost of all items is 4.5 + 2.5 = 7 dollars. Sally has 10 - 7 = 3 dollars left. The answer is 3.

[EXP] 416: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 350, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the number of apples Joanne gathered from each type of tree. She gathered 30 apples from the tallest trees. Her sister gathered twice as many, which is 30 x 2 = 60 apples. So, in total, they gathered 30 + 60 = 90 apples from the tallest trees.

Joanne gathered half as many apples from the shortest trees as she did from the tallest trees. So, she gathered 30 / 2 = 15 apples from the shortest trees. Her sister gathered 3 times as many, which is 15 x 3 = 45 apples. So, in total, they gathered 15 + 45 = 60 apples from the shortest trees.

The total number of apples gathered from the average trees is 500 - (90 + 60) = 500 - 150 = 350 apples.

Since Joanne gathered all the apples from the average trees, she gathered 350 apples.

Zack's locker = 4 x Peter's locker
Zack's locker = 4 x 5
Zack's locker = 20 cubic inches

Since Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker, we can set up the equation:

Timothy's locker = 2 x Zack's locker
Timothy's locker = 2 x 20
Timothy's locker = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

[EXP] 441: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 98, [output]:  First, we need to find the width of the room. Since the area is 360 square feet, and the length is 3 yards, we can set up an equation:

Area = Length x Width
360 = 3 x Width

To find the width, we can divide both sides by 3:

Width = 360 / 3
Width = 120

So the width of the room is 120 feet.

Now that we know the length and width, we can find the perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)

Plugging in the values, we get:

Perimeter = 2(3 + 120)
Perimeter = 2 x 123
Perimeter = 246

So the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 246 feet.

To convert minutes to miles, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 30/60 = 0.5 hours. Since MPH is miles per hour, we multiply 0.5 hours by 32 MPH to get the distance the horse runs: 0.5 x 32 = 16 miles. For every mile, the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay. So for 16 miles, the horse eats 16 x 1/2 = 8 bails of hay. Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost is 8 x 3 = 24 dollars. Michael has 6 five-dollar bills, which is a total of 6 x 5 = 30 dollars.

* Hay: 42 bales x 75 pounds/bale = 3150 pounds
* Oats: 20 sacks x 65 pounds/sack = 1300 pounds

Total weight: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3500 pounds

Since the farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, the farmer will need to make:

3500 pounds / 2250 pounds/trip = 1.55 trips

So, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

[EXP] 473: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total. He can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus 2 extra for cleaning his room. Let's call the number of carrot sticks he eats "x". Then, the number of cookies he can have is (x/2) + 2.

We know that Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total, so we can set up the equation:

(x/2) + 2 = 5

To solve for x, we can subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

x/2 = 3

Then, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.

This means that the number of students with desktop computers is the total number of students minus the number without desktop computers. Let's call the total number of students x. Then, the number of students with desktop computers is x - 20.

We know that three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. So, we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = (3/4)x

To solve for x, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation:

x = (3/4)x + 20

Subtracting (3/4)x from both sides gives:

(1/4)x = 20

Multiplying both sides by 4 gives:

[EXP] 480: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 15400, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, the plane tickets cost $5000 each. Since there are 2 people, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 x $5000 = $10,000.

Next, the hotel is 20% more expensive than normal. To find the normal price, we can multiply the normal price by 1.2 (100% + 20% = 120%).

The normal price is $1500 per day, so the price for a 3-day stay would be 3 x $1500 = $4500. With the 20% increase, the total hotel cost would be $4500 x 1.2 = $5400.

The total cost of the trip is the sum of the plane tickets and the hotel: $10,000 + $5400 = $14,400.

The answer is $14,400.

So the total cost for the first venue is $200 + (5 x number of guests). Let's call the number of guests "x". The total cost is $200 + 5x.

The cost of the second venue is $25 per guest. Since food is included, there is no additional cost for food. The total cost for the second venue is $25x.

We want to find the number of guests where the two venues have the same cost. We can set up an equation:

$200 + 5x = $25x

Subtract $200 from both sides:

5x = $25x - $200

Subtract $25x from both sides:

-20x = -200

Divide both sides by -20:

x = 10

So, 10 guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.

We also know that Lily found 7 more than David, so Lily found x/2 + 7 insects.

The total number of insects collected is 43, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x/2) + (x/2 + 7) = 43

Combine like terms:

x + x + x/2 + 7 = 43

Combine like terms:

3x/2 + 7 = 43

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x/2 = 36

Multiply both sides by 2:

3x = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 24

Now that we know Bodhi found 24 insects, we can find out how many insects David found:

David found x/2 = 24/2 = 12 insects

And Lily found 7 more than David:

[EXP] 515: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 90000, [output]:  Let's say the cost of the lot is x. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is 3x. The total cost of the house and the lot together is $120,000, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = 120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = 120,000

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 30,000

So the cost of the lot is $30,000. Since the house cost three times as much as the lot, the cost of the house is:

3x = 3(30,000) = $90,000

The answer is $90,000.

[EXP] 527: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour. She is planning to add a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day. So her new daily consumption will be 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.

Since she is planning to add the device for a week, her new weekly consumption will be 14 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 98 kilowatts.

Her original weekly consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour * 7 days = 84 kilowatts.

The difference between her weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is 98 - 84 = 14 kilowatts.

Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, and Ophelia has x chairs, Jenna has 3x chairs. We can set up an equation: x + 3x = 20 + 18. This simplifies to 4x = 38, so x = 9.5. Since you can't have half a chair, we round down to 9 chairs for Ophelia and 3x = 27 chairs for Jenna.

Ophelia has 20 sofas and 9 chairs, so she has 20 + 9 = 29 pieces of furniture. Jenna has 18 sofas and 27 chairs, so she has 18 + 27 = 45 pieces of furniture. In total, they have 29 + 45 = 74 pieces of furniture.

Since he wants to save twice as much in the second half, the total amount he needs to save is 1125. Let's call the amount he saves in the first half x. Then, the amount he saves in the second half will be 2x.

The total amount he needs to save is the sum of the amounts he saves in the first and second halves:

[EXP] 562: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Let's start by finding the weight of Susan. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, and Mark weighs 150 pounds, Susan weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.

Next, we know that Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so Bob weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.

To find the average weight of the three friends, we add their weights together and divide by 3:

(150 + 130 + 260) / 3 = 540 / 3 = 180

So, the average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.

[EXP] 588: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that there is 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This means that the number of red jelly beans is 99% of the number of blue jelly beans. Let's call the number of blue jelly beans x. Then, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99x.

We also know that there is 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans. This means that the number of green jelly beans is 101% of the number of blue jelly beans. So, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01x.

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:

0.99x + x + 1.01x = 4500

Combine like terms:

2.01x = 4500

Divide both sides by 2.01:

x = 2234

Now that we know the number of blue jelly beans, we can find the number of red jelly beans:

Number of red jelly beans = 0.99x = 0.99(2234) = 2205.66

Since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean, we'll round down to 2205.

Now, we can find the number of green jelly beans:

Number of green jelly beans = 1.01x = 1.01(2234) = 2255.34

Again, we'll round down to 2255.

Finally, we can find the difference between the number of green jelly beans and red jelly beans:

2255 - 2205 = 50

So, there are 50 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

[EXP] 596: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, so if his current age is x, his age 5 years ago was x - 5.

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives:

-x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides gives:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10.

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

The answer is 13.

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we need to subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street. 94,660 - 29,100 = 65,560. The answer is 65,560.

[EXP] 632: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4800, [output]:  Let's start by finding the price of the gold Jewell. Since the price of the gold Jewell is 4/5 times the price of the diamond Jewell, we can set up the equation:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) x Price of diamond Jewell

We know the price of the diamond Jewell is $2000, so we can substitute that in:

Price of gold Jewell = (4/5) x 2000
Price of gold Jewell = 1600

Now we know the price of the gold Jewell is $1600. The cost of the silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of the gold Jewell, so we can find the price of the silver Jewell by subtracting $400 from the price of the gold Jewell:

Price of silver Jewell = Price of gold Jewell - 400
Price of silver Jewell = 1600 - 400
Price of silver Jewell = 1200

Now we know the prices of all three jewels: diamond ($2000), gold ($1600), and silver ($1200). To find the total price, we add the prices together:

Total price = Price of diamond Jewell + Price of gold Jewell + Price of silver Jewell
Total price = 2000 + 1600 + 1200
Total price = 4800

The answer is $4800.

[EXP] 634: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's first find the distance between Bob and Tom. Since Bob is 75 miles ahead, that means Tom is 75 miles behind. 

Now, we need to find the relative speed between Bob and Tom. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds: 55 mph (Bob) - 70 mph (Tom) = -15 mph. This means Tom is moving 15 mph slower than Bob.

To find the time it will take Tom to catch up, we can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed. In this case, the distance is 75 miles, and the relative speed is -15 mph (since Tom is moving slower than Bob).

time = 75 miles / -15 mph = 5 hours

So it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

[EXP] 652: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

In the first month, Ariadne made $400 from red hats, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats. Let's call the total amount she earned from selling green hats "x". Since 400 is half of x, we can set up the equation:

400 = 0.5x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

800 = x

So Ariadne made $800 from selling green hats in the first month.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. The total sales of the first month were $800, so 3/4 of that is:

(3/4) × 800 = 600

So Ariadne made $600 in the second month.

To find the total amount she made in two months, we add the amounts from both months:

800 + 600 = 1400

The answer is $1400.

Since it took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice, and it took 30 minutes to cook rice, the combined cooking time of pork and rice is 2x30 = 60 minutes. Half of that is 30 minutes, so it took 30 minutes to cook the beans.

Since it took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice, it took 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook the pork.

Now we know it took 30 minutes to cook rice, 30 minutes to cook beans, and 50 minutes to cook pork. To find the total time, we add these up: 30 + 30 + 50 = 110 minutes.

[EXP] 661: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that the total number of animal heads is 20. This means that the number of sheep and geese heads combined is 20.

Let's say the number of sheep is x. Then, the number of geese is 20 - x, since the total number of heads is 20.

Each sheep has 4 legs, and each goose has 2 legs. So, the total number of legs is the sum of the legs of the sheep and geese:

4x + 2(20 - x) = 70

Combine like terms:

4x + 40 - 2x = 70

Simplify:

2x + 40 = 70

Subtract 40 from both sides:

2x = 30

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 15

He also buys a donut for 2 dollars. So the total cost is 42 + 2 = 44 dollars. The answer is 44.

[EXP] 667: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how much Kassidy has. Since Aurelia has 120 dollars and Kassidy has 3/4 times as much, we can multiply 120 by 3/4 to get Kassidy's amount:

120 * (3/4) = 90

So Kassidy has 90 dollars. Since Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, we can add 60 to Kassidy's amount to get Rayna's amount:

90 + 60 = 150

Now we know Rayna has 150 dollars. To find out how much they would have in total, we add their amounts together:

120 + 90 + 150 = 360

Since they want to share the money equally, we divide the total amount by 3:

360 ÷ 3 = 120

So each of them would have 120 dollars if they added their money together and shared it equally.

Finally, we are told that Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, so Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies.

To find the total number of cookies, we add up the number of cookies each person has:

68 (Katarina) + 73 (Max) + 61 (Cookie Monster) + 96 (Summer) = 298

Adding the 20cm lace trim, the total length is 1.5x + 20 = 140.

We can set up an equation: 1.5x + 20 = 140

Subtract 20 from both sides: 1.5x = 120

Divide both sides by 1.5: x = 80

So, the original length of the dress was 80cm.

We know that the combined ages of the twins and triplets are 44. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 7) + x = 44

Combine like terms:

3x + 7 = 44

Subtract 7 from both sides:

3x = 37

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 12.33

Since the triplet's age is x, the triplet is 12 years old. The twin who is 7 years older than the triplet is 12 + 7 = 19 years old.

So, one of the twins is 19 years old.

[EXP] 717: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 770, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that John makes a 6-egg omelet. Each egg is 75 calories, so the total calories from the eggs is 6 x 75 = 450 calories.

Next, we know that John uses 2 oz of cheese. Cheese is 120 calories per ounce, so the total calories from the cheese is 2 x 120 = 240 calories.

We also know that John uses an equal amount of ham, which is 2 oz. Ham is 40 calories per ounce, so the total calories from the ham is 2 x 40 = 80 calories.

To find the total calories in the omelet, we add up the calories from the eggs, cheese, and ham: 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories.

The answer is 770.

[EXP] 727: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's start by converting Topher's shoe length from feet and inches to just inches. 8 feet is 8 x 12 = 96 inches, and 4 inches more is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.  So Topher's shoe is 100 inches long.

The problem says that Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.  So we can set up an equation:

100 = 9x + 10

To solve for x, we can subtract 10 from both sides:

90 = 9x

Next, we can divide both sides by 9:

10 = x

So one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.

Let's say the first house needs x cases of shingles. Since the second house needs 1/2 of the second, it needs x/2 cases of shingles.

The third house needs double the first, so it needs 2x cases of shingles.

The total number of cases needed is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x + x/2 + 2x = 250

Combine like terms:

3.5x = 250

Divide both sides by 3.5:

x = 71.43

Since you can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So the first house needs 72 cases of shingles.

The second house needs half of that, which is 36 cases.

The third house needs double the first, which is 144 cases.

The answer is 144.

[EXP] 780: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 255, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. The Llesis family drove for some time, and then they hiked for 1.5 hours. So, the total time they spent driving is 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours.

2. They drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. So, the distance they drove is 4.5 x 50 = 225 miles.

3. When they hiked, they hiked at an average speed of 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Their driving speed is 50 miles per hour, so half of that is 25 miles per hour. 5 miles per hour less than that is 20 miles per hour.

4. They hiked for 1.5 hours at a speed of 20 miles per hour. So, the distance they hiked is 1.5 x 20 = 30 miles.

5. The total distance they traveled is the sum of the distance they drove and the distance they hiked. This is 225 + 30 = 255 miles.

The answer is 255.

Ava:
- Enemies: 10 points for each, and she jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma. So she jumps on 8 + x enemies, where x is the number of enemies Emma jumps on. So, 10(x+8) points for enemies.
- Berries: 5 points for each, and she collects 3 more berries than Emma. So she collects x+3 berries, where x is the number of berries Emma collects. So, 5(x+3) points for berries.
- Timer: 30 points for every second left, and she finishes 4 seconds slower than Emma. So, Emma finishes 4 seconds earlier than Ava. So, Emma gets 30(4) = 120 points for the timer, and Ava gets 0 points for the timer.
Total points for Ava: 10(x+8) + 5(x+3) = 10x + 80 + 5x + 15 = 15x + 95

Emma:
- Enemies: 10 points for each, and she jumps on x enemies. So, 10x points for enemies.
- Berries: 5 points for each, and she collects x berries. So, 5x points for berries.
- Timer: 30 points for every second left, and she finishes 4 seconds earlier than Ava. So, she gets 30(4) = 120 points for the timer.
Total points for Emma: 10x + 5x + 120 = 15x + 120

The difference between their scores is the difference between their total points. So, we need to find 15x + 95 - (15x + 120). Simplifying, we get -25.

Next, we know that she uses twice as much oil as salt, and twice as much salt as zest. So, the amount of oil is 2 times the amount of salt, and the amount of salt is 2 times the amount of zest. We can write this as:

Oil = 2 * Salt
Salt = 2 * Zest

We also know that the amount of salt is equal to the amount of sugar. So, we can substitute Salt with Sugar in the equation:

Oil = 2 * Sugar

Now we have three equations and three variables. We can solve for the amount of oil by substituting the expression for Sugar into the equation for Oil:

Oil = 2 * (2 * Zest)
Oil = 4 * Zest

Since the amount of zest is equal to the amount of fragrance, we can substitute Zest with Fragrance:

Oil = 4 * Fragrance

The problem states that she makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. This means that the total amount of oil, zest, fragrance, salt, and sugar must add up to 10 ounces. Let's call the total amount of zest, fragrance, salt, and sugar "T". We can write this as:

T = Zest + Fragrance + Salt + Sugar

We know that Zest = Fragrance, so we can substitute Zest with Fragrance:

T = Fragrance + Fragrance + Sugar + Sugar

We also know that Salt = Sugar, so we can substitute Salt with Sugar:

T = Fragrance + Fragrance + Sugar + Sugar

Now we have:

T = 2 * Fragrance + 2 * Sugar

We know that the total amount of oil, zest, fragrance, salt, and sugar is 10 ounces, so we can set up the equation:

2 * Fragrance + 2 * Sugar = 10

We can solve for Fragrance by dividing both sides by 2:

Fragrance + Sugar = 5

We can solve for Sugar by subtracting Fragrance from both sides:

Sugar = 5 - Fragrance

Now we can substitute Sugar into the equation for Oil:

Oil = 4 * Fragrance

We can substitute Sugar with 5 - Frag

[EXP] 826: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 153, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has. Let's call the number of cards PJ has "x". Then, Smendrick has 3x cards.

We also know that Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341

Combine like terms:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtract 12 from both sides:

7x = 329

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 47

So PJ has 47 cards. Smendrick has 3 times that, which is 3(47) = 141 cards. Becca has 12 more than Smendrick, which is 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

The answer is 153.

Next, let's find the number of pink eggs. Since she has one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, she has 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.

Now, let's find the number of yellow eggs. Since she has one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, and she has 9 pink eggs, she has 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.

Finally, let's add up the number of eggs Cindy has:

* 5 green eggs
* 10 blue eggs
* 9 pink eggs
* 3 yellow eggs

Total number of eggs = 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27

We are also told that Peter has twice as many socks as Jack. Let's call the number of Jack's socks x. Then, Peter has 2x socks.

We can set up an equation based on the information that Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks: 60 = 2x.

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 2: x = 60 / 2 = 30.

So, Jack has 30 socks. Peter has twice as many socks, which is 2x = 2(30) = 60 socks.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, we add the number of socks and dishes each has: 30 (Jack's socks) + 60 (Jack's dishes) + 30 (Peter's socks) + 30 (Peter's dishes) = 150.

[EXP] 866: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that they have 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Since they have 12 red cars, they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars.

Next, they have 3 times the number of blue cars as they have green cars. So, they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.

Now, we know they have 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars. To find the total number of cars, we add these up: 12 + 10 + 30 = 52.

Since they have a total of 75 cars, and we've accounted for 52 cars, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting 52 from 75: 75 - 52 = 23.

So, the rink has 23 yellow cars.

[EXP] 867: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn. This means Fawn has 12 more books than Anne. Let's call the number of books Anne has "A". Then, Fawn has A + 12 books.

We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has A + 25 books.

The total number of books the three of them have is 85, so we can set up the equation:

A + (A + 12) + (A + 25) = 85

Combine like terms:

3A + 37 = 85

Subtract 37 from both sides:

3A = 48

Divide both sides by 3:

A = 16

So Anne has 16 books. Fawn has 16 + 12 = 28 books.

Finally, she bought 7 packs of apples, each costing half the price of a pack of strawberries. A pack of strawberries costs 4 dollars, so a pack of apples costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars. 7 packs of apples will cost 7 x 2 = 14 dollars. In total, Kelly spent 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 dollars.

[EXP] 892: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 55, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* A whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob.
* A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second.

We can set up an equation to represent the relationship between the speeds of the whatchamacallit and the thingamabob:

Whatchamacallit speed = Thingamabob speed + 11

We know the whatchamacallit speed is 121 meters per second, so we can substitute that into the equation:

121 = Thingamabob speed + 11

Subtract 11 from both sides to get:

110 = Thingamabob speed

Now we know the thingamabob speed is 110 meters per second.

The problem also states that a whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. So, we can multiply the thingamabob speed by 5 to get the whirligig speed:

Whirligig speed = Thingamabob speed x 5
= 110 x 5
= 550

Therefore, the whirligig spins at 550 meters per second.

Tasha made a total of $80. She made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn. So, she made $80 - $6 = $74 from mowing Kamala's and Alba's lawns.

The first week, she mowed Kamala's lawn thrice as many times as she did Joe's. Let's say she mowed Joe's lawn x times. Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn 3x times. The total amount she made from mowing Kamala's and Joe's lawns that week is 6x. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, 6x = 6, so x = 1. She mowed Joe's lawn once and Kamala's lawn 3 times.

The following week, she mowed Alba's lawn five times as many times as she did Joe's. She mowed Joe's lawn once, so she mowed Alba's lawn 5 times. The total amount she made from mowing Alba's and Joe's lawns that week is 6 + 5 = 11. Since she made $6 from mowing Joe's lawn, she made $11 - $6 = $5 from mowing Alba's lawn.

The total amount she made from mowing lawns is 6 + 3x + 5 = 6 + 3 + 5 = 14. She made $74 from mowing lawns, so the amount she made from lemonade sales is $74 - $14 = $60. The answer is $60.

We know that Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x/2)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 4

So Duncan's age eight years ago was 4. Since Duncan is 60 now, his age eight years ago was 60 - 8 = 52.

Now, we can find Adam's age four years ago by subtracting 4 from 52:

52 - 4 = 48

So Adam's age four years ago was 48.

To find Adam's age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:

[EXP] 917: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Let's start by finding the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had. They bought a cake for $11, and 1 dozen balloons for $0.5 for 2 balloons. 1 dozen balloons is 12 balloons, so they bought 12/2 = 6 sets of 2 balloons. 6 sets of 2 balloons is 6 x 0.5 = 3 dollars. So they spent 11 + 3 = 14 dollars on the cake and balloons. They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, so they spent 2 x 7 = 14 dollars on the ice cream. In total, they spent 14 + 14 = 28 dollars. Since they started with the same amount of money, they must have each had half of the total amount. 28 / 2 = 14. The answer is 14.

[EXP] 921: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 47, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

1. Larry has 3 cats.
2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 x 3 = 9 dogs.
3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.
4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 7 x 3 = 21 fish.
5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has 21 / 3 = 7 gerbils.

Now, let's add up the number of pets Larry has:

* Cats: 3
* Dogs: 9
* Rabbits: 7
* Fish: 21
* Gerbils: 7

Total number of pets: 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47

[EXP] 932: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

We know that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. We can write this as an equation:

Peter + Paul + Jean = 100

We also know that Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can write:

Paul = Jean + 10

We are also told that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so we can write:

Peter = Paul + Jean

Now we can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get:

Peter = (Jean + 10) + Jean

Combine like terms:

Peter = 2Jean + 10

Now we have a system of two equations and two variables:

Peter + Paul + Jean = 100
Peter = 2Jean + 10

We can solve the second equation for Peter:

Peter = 2Jean + 10

Substitute this expression for Peter into the first equation:

(2Jean + 10) + Paul + Jean = 100

Combine like terms:

3Jean + 10 + Paul = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

3Jean + Paul = 90

Now we can substitute the first equation (Paul = Jean + 10) into this equation:

3Jean + (Jean + 10) = 90

Combine like terms:

4Jean + 10 = 90

Subtract 10 from both sides:

4Jean = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

Jean = 20

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Paul = Jean + 10
= 20 + 10
= 30

Finally, we can find Peter's age:

Peter = 2Jean + 10
= 2(20) + 10
= 40 + 10
= 50

So Peter is 50 years old.

[EXP] 936: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 64800, [output]:  First, let's calculate how many widgets each machine will make in a day. The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets an hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, so it will make 60 * 24 = 1440 widgets a day. The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets an hour, so it will make 45 * 24 = 1080 widgets a day.

Next, let's calculate how many widgets each machine will make in a month. There are 30 days in a month, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 1440 * 30 = 43,200 widgets, and the WidgetMaster 9000 will make 1080 * 30 = 32,400 widgets.

Now, let's calculate how much money each machine will make. Each widget sells for $6, so the Widgeteer 3000 will make 43,200 * 6 = $258,000, and the WidgetMaster 9000 will make 32,400 * 6 = $194,400.

Finally, let's calculate how much more money the Widgeteer 3000 will make compared to the WidgetMaster 9000. The difference is $258,000 - $194,400 = $63,600. The answer is $63,600.

[EXP] 964: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 147, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught. Let's say Adelwolfe has caught x Pokémon. Then Stan has caught 4x - 13 Pokémon.

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5 = 4x - 8 Pokémon.

The total number of Pokémon caught is the sum of the Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe: 339 = (4x - 8) + (4x - 13) + x

Combine like terms: 339 = 9x - 21

Add 21 to both sides: 360 = 9x

Divide both sides by 9: x = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon, we can find out how many Stan has caught: Stan has caught 4x - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147 Pokémon.

The answer is 147.

[EXP] 966: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 374, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

The bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour. To find the distance, multiply the speed and time: 30 x 10 = 300 miles.

Then, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour. To find the distance, multiply the speed and time: 18 x 2 = 36 miles.

The bird then flies south again for 5 hours at 22 miles per hour. To find the distance, multiply the speed and time: 22 x 5 = 110 miles.

The total distance flown south is the sum of the two parts: 300 + 110 = 410 miles.

The distance flown north is 36 miles.

To find the total distance between the northern and southern homes, add the distance flown south and the distance flown north: 410 + 36 = 446 miles.

The answer is 446.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, so he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread on Sunday.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

The total number of boxes of gingerbread sold is 10 + 15 = 25. The total number of boxes of apple pie sold is 11 + 15 = 26.

The total cost of gingerbread sold is 25 x 6 = 150 dollars. The total cost of apple pie sold is 26 x 15 = 390 dollars.

The room will warm up 2 degrees an hour without the air conditioner. So, after 2 hours, the room will be 2 degrees warmer. Then, the air conditioner is turned on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2 degrees an hour. So, the room will be 2 degrees cooler after 3 hours. The temperature will be 2 - 2 = 0 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Then, the air conditioner is turned up to high for 4 hours, cooling the room 3 degrees an hour. So, the room will be 3 degrees cooler after 4 hours. The temperature will be 0 - 3 = -3 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

Finally, the air conditioner is turned off for 2 hours, and the room warms up 2 degrees an hour. So, the room will be 2 degrees warmer after 2 hours. The temperature will be -3 + 2 = -1 degrees lower than the starting temperature.

The first plane makes a total of 4/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 6/4 = 3/2 trips. Since the second plane makes half the number of trips, it makes 3/2 / 2 = 3/4 trips. So the first plane makes 3/2 - 3/4 = 1/4 more trips than the second plane.

The second plane makes 44 trips, which is half the number of trips the first plane makes. So the first plane makes 2 x 44 = 88 trips.

The first plane goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, and the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany. So the number of flights to France is 1/4 of the total trips. 1/4 of 88 is 22.

Helene = 2 x (average age)

We know that the total age of the group is 20, so we can set up another equation:

Akbar + Alessandro + Helene + Wilfred = 20

We are given that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old, so we can substitute these values into the equation:

3 + 4 + Helene + Wilfred = 20

Combine like terms:

7 + Helene + Wilfred = 20

Subtract 7 from both sides:

Helene + Wilfred = 13

Now we can substitute the expression for Helene from the first equation:

2 x (average age) + Wilfred = 13

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age, we can set up another equation:

Helene = 2 x (average age)

Substitute this expression into the previous equation:

2 x (average age) + Wilfred = 13

Subtract 2 x (average age) from both sides:

Wilfred = 13 - 2 x (average age)

Now we can substitute the values of Akbar and Alessandro into the equation for the average age:

Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene + Wilfred) / 4

Substitute the values of Akbar and Alessandro:

Average age = (3 + 4 + Helene + Wilfred) / 4

Simplify:

Average age = (7 + Helene + Wilfred) / 4

Substitute the value of Helene:

Average age = (7 + 2 x (average age) + Wilfred) / 4

Simplify:

Average age = (7 + 2 x (average age) + Wilfred) / 4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4 x Average age = 7 + 2 x (average age) + Wilfred

Simplify:

4 x Average age = 7 + 2 x (average age) + Wilfred

Subtract 7 from both sides:

4 x Average age - 7 = 2 x (average age) + Wilfred

Subtract 2 x (average age) from both sides:

One-fourth of these are male, so 1/4 * 1500 = 375 are male. The remaining students are under 16, which is 3000 - 1500 = 1500. Half of these are male, so 1/2 * 1500 = 750 are male. The remaining students are female. The number of female students over 16 is 1500 - 375 = 1125. The number of female students under 16 is 1500 - 750 = 750. In total, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students. The answer is 1875.

[EXP] 1012: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6000, [output]: 18000 is the capacity of the tank. Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank on the first day. 1/4 of 18000 is 4500. Ms. B filled 3/4 as much as Wanda, so she filled 4500 * 3/4 = 3375 gallons. So in total, they filled 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons on the first day. On the second day, Wanda filled 2/3 of what she filled on the first day, which is 4500 * 2/3 = 3000 gallons. Ms. B filled 1/3 of what she filled on the first day, which is 3375 * 1/3 = 1125 gallons. So on the second day, they filled 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons. In total, they filled 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons. Since the tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons, there are 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons remaining. The answer is 6000.

[EXP] 1013: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 94, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, the power bank is not fully charged, but we don't know the initial charge. Let's call the initial charge x.

After 5 hours, the power bank loses 9% of its capacity each hour, so it loses 9% * 5 = 45% of its capacity. This means the remaining charge is 100% - 45% = 55%.

After 3 more hours, the power bank loses 7% of its capacity each hour, so it loses 7% * 3 = 21% of its capacity. This means the remaining charge is 55% - 21% = 34%.

The problem states that the charge remaining is 28%. Since 34% is the remaining charge after the second period, the initial charge must have been 28% + 6% = 34%.

So, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 34%.

[EXP] 1023: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the number of large stuffed animals sold is x.

Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, the number of small stuffed animals sold is 2x.

The price of a small stuffed animal is $4, so the total amount earned from small stuffed animals is 2x * 4 = 8x.

The price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small one, so it's 3 * 4 = 12 dollars. The total amount earned from large stuffed animals is x * 12.

The total amount earned is $120, so we can set up the equation:

8x + x * 12 = 120

Combine like terms:

9x + 12x = 120

Combine the x terms:

21x = 120

Divide both sides by 21:

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.

Since she sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, she sold 2x = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

The answer is 12.

Let's say Rory retrieved x balls in the second set. Then, in the first set, he retrieved x + 4 balls (since he retrieved 4 more balls than in the second set).

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, so he retrieved x/2 balls.

The total number of balls he retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

3x/2 + 4 = 19

Subtract 4 from both sides:

3x/2 = 15

Multiply both sides by 2:

3x = 30

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 10

So Rory retrieved 10 balls in the second set. In the first set, he retrieved 10 + 4 = 14 balls.

[EXP] 1055: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, we need to find the total number of tiles needed to cover the kitchen floor. To do this, we need to find the total area of the floor in square feet, which is given as 200 SqFt.

Since each tile side is 1ft in length, the area of each tile is 1ft x 1ft = 1 SqFt.

To find the total number of tiles needed, we can divide the total area of the floor (200 SqFt) by the area of each tile (1 SqFt):

200 SqFt (total area) ÷ 1 SqFt (area of each tile) = 200 tiles

So, we need 200 tiles to cover the kitchen floor.

Now, we can find the total cost of the renovation by multiplying the number of tiles needed by the cost of each tile:

200 tiles x $12 per tile = $2400

Therefore, it will cost $2400 to renovate my kitchen floor.

[EXP] 1057: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 156, [output]:  Greg puts clean sheets on 4 twin beds and 1 king size bed every week. So he does 4 + 1 = 5 sets of sheets per week. The laundry machine can do 2 twin sets and 1 king set at a time. So he needs to do 5 / 3 = 1.67 loads of laundry per week. Since we can't do a fraction of a load, we round up to 2 loads per week. In a year, he does 52 weeks * 2 loads = 104 loads of laundry. The answer is 104.

[EXP] 1062: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 58, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that the meal was made in 98 minutes. We can say that Donovan's part took x minutes, and Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes. Since they made the meal together, the total time is the sum of their individual times: x + (x + 18) = 98.

Combine like terms: 2x + 18 = 98

Subtract 18 from both sides: 2x = 80

Divide both sides by 2: x = 40

So Donovan's part took 40 minutes. Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.

The answer is 58.

2. The second train arrives 20 minutes after the first train leaves, which is at 50 minutes (30 + 20). It stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, which is 5 minutes (20 / 4). So, it will leave the station at 55 minutes (50 + 5).
3. The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, which is at 1 hour 55 minutes (55 + 60). It leaves the station immediately after it arrives, so it will leave at 1 hour 55 minutes.
4. The fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves, which is at 2 hours 15 minutes (1 hour 55 minutes + 20).

x + (x + 60) = 100

Combine like terms:

2x + 60 = 100

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2x = 40

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 20

So Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet of fence. To find out how much is left over for Sam, subtract the amount he gets from the total:

100 - 20 = 80

So there is no leftover fence for Sam, as he gets the entire 20 feet.

First, let's find out how many Trekking bikes were sold. Half of the total bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes were sold.

Next, let's find out how many BMX bikes were sold. 15% of the total bikes sold were BMX bikes, so 15% of 300 = 0.15 x 300 = 45 BMX bikes were sold.

Now, let's find out how many MTB bikes were sold. We know that the total number of bikes sold is 300, and we already know that 150 were Trekking bikes and 45 were BMX bikes. So, the number of MTB bikes sold is 300 - 150 - 45 = 105.

Now, let's find the total revenue earned from selling bikes. The prices of the bikes are:
- MTB: $500
- BMX: $250 (half the price of an MTB)
- Trekking: $450

The number of bikes sold for each type is:
- MTB: 105
- BMX: 45
- Trekking: 150

The total revenue earned is:
- MTB: 105 x $500 = $52,500
- BMX: 45 x $250 = $11,250
- Trekking: 150 x $450 = $67,500

The total area is 80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 square feet.

Since a gallon of paint can cover 20 square feet and cost $12, we can divide the total area by 20 to find the number of gallons needed:

She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. To find the sale price, we need to calculate 10% of $30.00, which is 0.10 x $30.00 = $3.00. The sale price is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00. She put this on her credit card, so her new balance is $86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

The answer is $113.00.

[EXP] 1104: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. A fifth of the jellyfish are large. Let's call the total number of jellyfish "x". Then, the number of large jellyfish is x/5.
2. A third of the large jellyfish change color. So, the number of large jellyfish that change color is (x/5) / 3 = x/15.
3. When a UV light turned on, 6 jellyfish changed color. This is the number of large jellyfish that change color, so x/15 = 6.
4. To find the total number of jellyfish, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 15: x = 6 * 15 = 90.

So, there are 90 jellyfish in the tank.

[EXP] 1111: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 9,300 miles is the total distance Soledad wants to hike. She will hike 2 times a day, covering 125 miles each time. So, in a day, she will hike 2 x 125 = 250 miles. To find out how many days she needs to hike, we can divide the total distance by the daily distance: 9,300 / 250 = 37 days. So, she will hike for 37 days. Now, we need to find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey in 30 days (since she is on vacation for the entire month of June, which has 30 days). To find out how many miles she needs to hike per day, we can divide the total distance by the number of days: 9,300 / 30 = 310. So, she needs to hike 310 miles per day. Since she is already hiking 250 miles per day, she needs to hike 310 - 250 = 60 more miles per day. The answer is 60.

Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. So we can set up the equation x + x + (Sarah's eggs) + (Sarah's eggs + 12) = 56.

Combine like terms: 2x + 2(Sarah's eggs) + 12 = 56

Subtract 12 from both sides: 2x + 2(Sarah's eggs) = 44

Divide both sides by 2: x + Sarah's eggs = 22

Since Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together, Sarah's eggs must be 30 - 12 = 18. So x + 18 = 22.

Subtract 18 from both sides: x = 4

So Arnold and Madeline painted 4 eggs each. Camden painted 12 more than Sarah, so Camden painted 18 + 12 = 30 eggs. To find out how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, subtract 4 from 30: 30 - 4 = 26.

[EXP] 1154: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. Let's say Carrey collected x seashells. Then Carlos collected 2x seashells.

We know that Jim collected 5 more seashells than Carlos, so Jim collected 2x + 5 seashells.

We also know that the total number of seashells they gathered is 27 + 2x + x = 27 + 3x.

Since they divided the seashells equally among themselves, each person got an equal share. Let's call this share y. Then, the total number of seashells is 3y.

We can set up the equation:

27 + 3x = 3y

To solve for y, we can subtract 27 from both sides:

3x = 3y - 27

Divide both sides by 3:

x = y - 9

Now we know that x is equal to y - 9. We can substitute this expression for x into the equation 2x + 5 = 27:

[EXP] 1159: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7300, [output]: 2300 people need 100% of their daily energy demand. Each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand. So, 2300 people need 100% - 20% = 80% more energy demand. 80% of 2300 people is 80% * 2300 = 1840 people. Each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, so 1840 people need 1840 / 20% = 9200 juices. Since Hortex can produce 4200 bottles of juices per day, it would need to produce 9200 - 4200 = 5000 more bottles of juices. The answer is 5000.

[EXP] 1169: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that the blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope. This means that the yellow rope is 7 centimeters longer than the blue rope. Let's call the length of the yellow rope "y" and the length of the blue rope "b". Then, we can write an equation:

y = b + 7

We also know that the red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can write another equation:

r = 4b

We are also given that the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters, so we can write a third equation:

r + b + y = 37

Substituting the first two equations into the third equation, we get:

4b + b + (b + 7) = 37

Combine like terms:

6b + 7 = 37

Subtract 7 from both sides:

6b = 30

Divide both sides by 6:

b = 5

Now that we know the length of the blue rope, we can find the length of the yellow rope by substituting b into the equation y = b + 7:

y = 5 + 7

y = 12

Finally, we can find the length of the red rope by substituting b into the equation r = 4b:

r = 4(5)

r = 20

The length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.

[EXP] 1171: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

Let's say the amount of red, white, and purple paint is x. Since there are equal amounts of each, we can say that the amount of red, white, and purple paint is x, x, and x.

The total amount of paint used is 12 pints, and half of it is yellow. So, the amount of yellow paint is 12 / 2 = 6 pints.

The total amount of non-yellow paint is 12 - 6 = 6 pints.

The amount of red, white, and purple paint is x + x + x = 3x. Since the total amount of non-yellow paint is 6 pints, we can set up the equation:

3x = 6

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 3:

x = 2

So, the amount of red, white, and purple paint is 2 pints each.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, the amount of red paint used is 2 pints.

[EXP] 1176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 fewer goals than team A, so team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 2 x 4 = 8 goals. Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B, which is 8 / 4 = 2 goals.

In the first half, the total number of goals scored is 4 (by team A) + 2 (by team B) = 6 goals. In the second half, the total number of goals scored is 2 (by team A) + 8 (by team B) = 10 goals.

The total number of goals scored in the match is the sum of the goals scored in both halves, which is 6 + 10 = 16 goals. The answer is 16.

Now, the teacher will use 20% of the chalk each day. 20% of 5 is 0.2 * 5 = 1 inch. So each day, the teacher will use 1 inch of chalk. To find out how many days the teacher has before he has to recycle the chalk, we divide the remaining chalk by the amount used each day. 2.75 / 1 = 2.75 days. The answer is 2.75.

[EXP] 1182: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now. Let's call Colin's current age "x". Then, in 7 years, Colin will be x + 7 years old. Since Wendy is five times as old, we can set up the equation:

Wendy's current age = 5(x + 7)

Now, let's use the information that in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. Let's call Wendy's current age "y". Then, in 25 years, Wendy will be y + 25 years old. Since Colin will be a third as old, we can set up the equation:

x + 25 = (1/3)(y + 25)

Now we have two equations and two variables. We can solve for x by substituting the first equation into the second equation:

x + 25 = (1/3)(5(x + 7) + 25)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 25 = (1/3)(5x + 35)

x + 25 = (5x/3) + 35/3

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

25 = (4x/3) + 35/3

Subtracting 35/3 from both sides gives:

-10/3 = (4x/3)

Multiplying both sides by 3 gives:

-10 = 4x

Dividing both sides by -4 gives:

x = 10/4

x = 2.5

So Colin is currently 2.5 years old.

[EXP] 1216: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we need to find the volume of the jar. The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. In this case, the length and width are both 6 inches, and the height is 15 inches. So, the volume of the jar is:

6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches

Since the jelly beans are packed with 80% efficiency, that means that 20% of the jar is empty space. To find the actual volume of the jelly beans, we can multiply the total volume of the jar by 0.8:

540 x 0.8 = 432 cubic inches

Since each jelly bean is 0.15 cubic inches, we can divide the actual volume of the jelly beans by the volume of a single jelly bean to find the total number of jelly beans:

432 / 0.15 = 2880 jelly beans

Since 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can multiply the total number of jelly beans by 0.3 to find the number of red jelly beans:

2880 x 0.3 = 864 red jelly beans

The problem states that the true number of red jelly beans is 900. To find how far off Tim's guess was, we can subtract his estimated number of red jelly beans from the true number:

900 - 864 = 36

So, Tim was 36 jelly beans off from the true number of red jelly beans.

[EXP] 1217: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

Initially, the bus has 20 people.

On the first stop, 40 people enter the bus, so the total number of people on the bus becomes 20 + 40 = 60.

On the second stop, 3/4 of the people who entered the bus at the first stop enter the bus. Since 40 people entered the bus at the first stop, 3/4 of 40 is 30. So, 30 more people enter the bus, making the total number of people on the bus 60 + 30 = 90.

At this point, the bus has 200 - 90 = 110 seats remaining.

On the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles. So, the total number of people on the bus becomes 90 x 2 = 180.

To fill the remaining 200 - 180 = 20 seats, 20 more people are required.

So, the total cost with the discount is $75 - $15 = $60.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the nail art. Karen wants to add nail art on each of her fingers, and there are 10 fingers on each hand (5 on each hand). So, the total cost of the nail art is 10 x $3 = $30.

Let's call the number of strawberry cubes x. Then, the number of blueberry cubes is 5x - 4.

We know that the total number of ice cubes Mary makes is 116. This means that the sum of the number of strawberry cubes and the number of blueberry cubes is 116.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

x + (5x - 4) = 116

Combine like terms:

6x - 4 = 116

Add 4 to both sides:

6x = 120

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 20

So, Mary makes 20 strawberry cubes. Now we can find the number of blueberry cubes:

[EXP] 1259: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

There are 5 phones in total, and the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. This means that the main phone costs 2x, and each additional phone costs x.

The main phone costs $20, so 2x = 20. To find the cost of each additional phone, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = 20/2
x = 10

So each additional phone costs $10.

There are 4 additional phones (since the main phone is one of the 5 phones), and each costs $10. The total cost of the additional phones is:

4 x 10 = 40

Adding the cost of the main phone ($20) to the cost of the additional phones ($40), we get:

20 + 40 = 60

The whole phone plan costs $60.

[EXP] 1307: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Dr. Grumpus asked Igor to gather 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes. Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes. Igor gathered 2 more Petri dishes than requested, so he gathered 14 + 2 = 16 Petri dishes. Igor gathered the correct number of beakers, 7. In total, Igor gathered 8 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 16 Petri dishes, which is 8 + 7 + 16 = 31 items. Since Igor placed 29 items on the lab bench, he lost 31 - 29 = 2 beakers. The answer is 2.

[EXP] 1310: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how much money Kim and Maryam raised. Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, who raised $430. So Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750. Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300. So Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Now we know that Kim raised $750 and Maryam raised $700. To find the total amount they raised, we add these amounts together: $750 + $700 = $1450.

We also know that Alexandra raised $430, and Sarah raised $300. To find the total amount they raised, we add these amounts together: $430 + $300 = $730.

Now we can find the total amount the girls raised in total by adding the amounts raised by Kim, Maryam, Alexandra, and Sarah: $1450 + $730 = $2180.

The answer is 2180.

[EXP] 1311: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that if Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron would have run 2 miles. Since Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes, it would take him 16/2 = 8 minutes to run 1 mile.

Since Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron, she ran 4 miles, which would take her 4 x 8 = 32 minutes. The answer is 32.

[EXP] 1315: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that James is currently 12 x 2 = 24 years old.

Since James was born when John was 19, John is currently 24 - 19 = 5 years older than James.

John's youngest son was born when John was 32, so John's youngest son is currently 32 - 5 = 27 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 27 + 3 = 30 years old.

[EXP] 1316: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange. Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange. So in 1 minute, Ana can peel 1/3 orange and Jane can peel 1/4 orange. In 60 minutes, Ana can peel 60/3 = 20 oranges and Jane can peel 60/4 = 15 oranges. So Ana will peel 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges than Jane. The answer is 5.

[EXP] 1317: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 230, [output]: 80% off means the cost is 20% of the original price. 20% of 400 is 0.2 x 400 = 80. So the cost is 400 - 80 = 320. Then he hires a mechanic for 3 hours at 50 dollars an hour. 3 x 50 = 150. So he paid 320 + 150 = 470 dollars. The answer is 470.

[EXP] 1318: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that the animals have a total of 70 legs. Since each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, we can set up an equation:

2c + 4(20 - c) = 70

where c is the number of chickens.

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2c + 80 - 4c = 70

Combine like terms:

-2c = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

c = 5

So there are 5 chickens.

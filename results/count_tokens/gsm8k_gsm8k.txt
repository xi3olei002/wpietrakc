[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 70000, [output]:  There are a lot of steps to follow in this problem.  Josh bought a house for $80,000, but then he put in $50,000 in repairs.   That means he spent $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.  
The house increased in value by 150%.  What does 150% mean? It means that the value increased to 3 times its original value.  If the house was originally $80,000 and the value increased by 150%, then the new value is $80,000 x 3 = $240,000.  So the house is now worth $240,000. 
Now we figure out how much profit Josh made.  Josh originally spent $130,000 to buy and renovate the house.   After the renovation, it is worth $240,000.   If he sells the house, he will get back $240,000.   The profit is the amount by which he sold the house for more than he spent.  $240,000 - $130,000 = $110,000.  The answer is $110,000.

[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

1. 200 GB is the total file size. 
2.  Initially, Carla can download 2 GB/minute.  So, it would take 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the whole file. 
3.  However, Windows restarts the download after downloading 40% of the file.  40% of 200 GB is 0. 4 * 200 = 80 GB.  
4.   Since she loses progress when Windows restarts, she has to download the remaining 120 GB again.  
5.   The download speed is still 2 GB/minute.  So, it will take 120 / 2 = 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB.  
6.    In total, it takes 100 minutes (download 80 GB initially) + 20 minutes (restart download) + 60 minutes (download final 120 GB) = 180 minutes to download the file.  The answer is 180 minutes.

[EXP] 9: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph.  3 hours at 60 mph means he has traveled 3 x 60 = 180 miles away from home. 

Then, he tries to get home in 4 hours.  He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, which means he doesn't move at all during that time. 

Then, he drives at 30 mph for half an hour.  Half an hour is 0. 5 hours, and 0. 5 x 30 is 15.  So he travels 15 miles during that half hour.  

Finally, he drives the remaining 2 hours at 80 mph.  2 hours at 80 mph means he has traveled 2 x 80 = 160 miles during those two hours.  Adding the 15 miles from before, that's 160 + 15 = 175 miles he traveled during those 2 hours.  

So, he drove 180 miles away, then traveled 175 miles back towards home.  The distance he is from home is the distance he drove away minus the distance he drove back.   180 - 175 is 5.  The answer is 5 miles.

[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Carlos needs to plant the tree.  The tree costs $90. 
The tree will grow 7 lemons per year.  If he can sell them for $1. 5 each, then that's 7 * $1. 5 = $10. 50 per year.  But since it costs $3 to water and feed the tree, his earning per year is actually $10 - $3 = $7. 

To find the years, we want to know when his earnings will be greater than the initial cost of $90.  
So, we want to know when $7 * years > $90.  
$7 * years > $90. 
We can set it up as a equation and solve for years.  $7 * years > $90.  
years > $90 / $7.  
years > 13.  Therefore, the minimum number of years is 14.  (You cannot have a fraction of a year, so it takes at least 14 years.  The exact number of years could be 14 but it wouldn't be less than that. )

[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Melanie started with some unknown number of vacuum cleaners.  She sold a third, so that is 1/3 of them.  Let's say the starting number of vacuum cleaners is x.  1/3 of x is x/3.  So she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners. 

A: After selling a third of the vacuum cleaners, she had x - x/3 = 2x/3 left.  Then she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners, so she had 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners left.  Next, she sold half of what was left, so that is 1/2 of (2x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners.  This is (1/2)(2x/3 - 2) or x/3 - 1 vacuum cleaners left.  But we know this is equal to 5.   So set x/3 - 1 = 5 and solve for x.  

First multiply both sides by 3 to get x - 3 = 15.  Add 3 to both sides to get x = 18.   So Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.  The answer is 18.

The calculation is $8,000 * (1 + 0.  012) = $8,096.  Between the two options, the merchant will have a profit of $5,125 - $5,000 = $125 with the jewelry, and $8,096 - $8,000 = $96 with the electronic gadgets.  Since the profit made from the jewelry is larger, $125 > $96, the merchant should choose jewelry.  The answer is $125.

[EXP] 20: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's break down the problem step by step. 

Marissa walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour, so her speed for the first 4 miles is 4 miles / 1 hour = 4 miles per hour. 

She then took another hour to walk the next 2 miles, so her speed for the next 2 miles is 2 miles / 1 hour = 2 miles per hour. 

In the first 6 miles, she took 2 hours, so her average speed for the first 6 miles is 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour. 

Now, she has walked 6 miles and has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left.  She wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail.  So, the total time it takes her to complete the trail should be 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.  

She has already taken 2 hours, so she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left.  In this 1 hour, she needs to cover 6 miles.  So, her speed for the remaining 6 miles should be 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 21: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 10 liters of orange drink are 2/3 water. 2/3 of 10 liters is 20/3 liters = 6 2/3 liters. 8/3 liters are not water.  So 10 liters of orange drink have 6 2/3 liters of water. 

15 liters of pineapple drink are 3/5 water.  3/5 of 15 liters is 45/5 liters = 9 liters.  6/5 liters are not water.  So 15 liters of pineapple drink have 9 liters of water. 

Together, the total amount of water is 6 2/3 + 9 = 15 2/3 liters.  But 1 liter of orange drink was spilled, so that reduces the total water by 1 liter.  So the total water remaining is 15 2/3 - 1 = 14 2/3 liters. 

The remaining mixture has 24 liters in total.  It has 14 2/3 liters of water.  So to find the proportion of water, we need to do 14 2/3 divided by 24.  14 2/3 = 58/3.  So 58/3 divided by 24 is 29/12.  The proportion of water is 29/12.  We can simplify it to 29/12.  Another way to do it is to find the total amount of non-water in the mixed drink.  The mixed drink is comprised of the 4 liters of orange drink that are not water, and 6 liters of pineapple drink that are not water.  This is 4 + 6 = 10 liters.   The total drink is 24 liters, so the proportion of non-water is 10/24, which simplifies to 5/12.   So the proportion of water is 1 - 5/12 = 7/12.  This can be simplified to 7/12.  Both results match, indicating that the water proportion of the remaining mixture is 7/12.

[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 109, [output]:  Let's start by using the ratio to find their current ages.  Darrell is 7 parts and Allen is 11 parts.   If we add 7 and 11, we get 18 parts.  Then we divide 162 by 18 to find how many years each part is.    162 / 18 = 9.  So Darrell's age is 7 * 9 = 63 and Allen's age is 11 * 9 = 99.  10 years from now, Allen's age will be 99 + 10 = 109.  The answer is 109.

[EXP] 32: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]: 1.  The first friend said there are 80 jelly beans.  
2.  The second friend said there were 20 more than half of 80.  Half of 80 is 40.  40 + 20 is 60.  So the second friend guessed 60.   
3.   The third friend said there were 25% more than the first one, which is 80.   25% of 80 is 20.   80 + 20 is 100.  So the third friend guessed 100. 

To find the average, add up their guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.   Then divide by the number of guesses: 240/3 = 80.  So the average guess is 80.  The answer is 80.

[EXP] 34: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  Let's solve this problem step by step!

Gretchen has a total of 110 coins.  There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.   Let's use the letter "G" to represent the number of gold coins and the letter "S" to represent the number of silver coins.  We know that G = S + 30, because the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins.  We also know that G + S = 110, because the total number of coins is 110. 

Now we can simplify this equation.  By substituting G = S + 30 into G + S = 110, we get:

(S + 30) + S = 110


Simplify this equation:

S + S + 30 = 110


Combine like terms:

2S + 30 = 110


Subtract 30 from both sides:

2S = 80


Divide both sides by 2:


S = 40


So Gretchen has 40 silver coins.  Now, to find the number of gold coins, we substitute S = 40 into the equation G = S + 30:
G = 40 + 30 = 70


So Gretchen has 70 gold coins.  The answer is 70.

Then we need to find out how many jewels Siobhan has.  Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so we can subtract 2 from Aaron's 25 jewels to find Siobhan's jewels.  25 - 2 is 23.   The answer is 23.

[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  John started with 13 lego sets.  He sells them each for 15 dollars.  So he earned 13 x 15 = 195 dollars.  He uses this money to buy 8 video games for 20 dollars each.   That cost 8 x 20 = 160 dollars.  John has 5 dollars left after buying all the video games.   So he must have earned 195 - 160 = 35 dollars in spare change.  This is coming from 13 - x lego sets.    A lego set is 15 dollars, so 15 x x = 35.   Solving for x, we get x = 2.  So he sold 13 - 2 = 11 lego sets, and has 2 left.   The answer is 2.

[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 163, [output]:  Candice started with 80 post-it notes.  During her work at the coffee shop, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee.  So she used 220 post-it notes.   Now, we can subtract the 220 post-it notes used from the original 80 to see how many post-it notes she had remaining at her workplace 80 - 220 = -140  So, Candice didn't have -140 post-it notes.  She must have bought more.  At work, she only had 23 post-it notes remaining.  This means she bought a package of post-it notes that had a quantity greater than 23.  To find the number of post-it notes in the package that she purchased, we need to add the post-it notes remaining to the post-it notes that she used at the coffee shop.   We know that she used 220 cards at the coffee shop and had 23 remaining.   So, she had 220 + 23 = 243 post-it notes after her work.   This 243 is equal to the total post-it notes Candice started with (80) plus the amount in the package she purchased (`x`).    So, let's set up the equation: 80 + `x` = 243.   To solve for `x`, we subtract 80 from both sides:  x = 243 - 80  x = 163.  Finally, we can conclude that Candice bought a package with 163 post-it notes.  The answer is 163.

John also said that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties.  50% of 40 is 20, so the red ties cost 40 + 20 = 60.  Since he bought 10 of these, he spent 60 * 10 = 600 for these ties.  And, he spent 200 for the blue ties.  The total he spent on the ties is 600 + 200 = 800.  The answer is 800.

We know that the bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds.  The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.   The weight of the driver and the empty truck plus the boxes must not exceed the maximum weight of the bridge. 

Let's first subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit:
5000 - 3755 = 1245

This means that the total weight of the boxes must not exceed 1245 pounds.  Each box weighs 15 pounds.   To find the maximum number of boxes, we divide the maximum weight (1245) by the weight of each box (15):
1245 ÷ 15 = 83

[EXP] 65: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Sophia has not yet filled up the tank, so she has only used 4 gallons out of 12.  12 - 4 = 8 gallons left.  Since she needed 4 gallons to fill it up, 8 gallons will be enough to fill it up completely, and she has already driven 100 miles on 4 gallons.  To find the number of miles she can drive on 1 gallon, we divide 100 by 4:  100 ÷ 4 = 25 miles per gallon.   So she can drive 25 miles on 1 gallon.  Now we have to multiply this by 8 gallons to find the total miles:  25 x 8 = 200 miles.  Sophia can drive 200 miles on a single tank of gas.  The answer is 200.

[EXP] 79: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's figure out how much money Vincent would spend on flowers at each rate first.  At 3 flowers for $2. 50, Vincent can buy:

* 18 flowers ÷ 3 flowers per package = 6 packages
* 6 packages x $2. 50 per package = $15

So at this rate, Vincent would spend $15 on 18 flowers.  At 2 flowers for $1, he can buy:

* 18 flowers ÷ 2 flowers per package = 9 packages
* 9 packages x $1 per package = $9

So at this rate, Vincent would spend $9 on 18 flowers.  To find out how much money Vincent saves, we subtract the amount he would spend at the 2 flowers for $1 rate from the amount he would spend at the 3 flowers for $2. 50 rate:

* $15 (at 3 flowers for $2. 50) - $9 (at 2 flowers for $1) = $6

But 5 took the exit, so 30 - 5 = 25 cars are left after all cars have driven through the traffic jam. 25 - 20 = 5, so 5 cars drove through in the first 15 minutes.  The answer is 5.

[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 175, [output]:  Jerome had 4 friends.  The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.  The second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first.  1/4 of 20 is 5.  So the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.   The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend.  The fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, so the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.  The first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed 25, the third friend 70, and the fourth friend 60.  Those are a total of 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175.  The answer is 175.

[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

John drinks a glass of water for breakfast, lunch, and dinner 5 days a week (Monday to Friday).  That's 3 glasses of water per day for 5 days, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 glasses of water.  Then, he drinks one glass of water before going to bed, which adds up to 16 glasses of water from Monday to Friday. 

On the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John doesn't drink water for breakfast or before bedtime.  But he still drinks water for lunch and dinner.  So that's 2 glasses of water for 2 days, which is 2 x 2 = 4 glasses of water.  

In total, John drinks 16 glasses of water during the weekdays and 4 glasses of water on the weekends.  To find the total number of glasses of water in a week, add those together: 16 + 4 = 20.  John drinks 20 glasses of water in a week.  The answer is 20.

[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

For one box, the dimensions without the walls are:
L = 5 - 1 = 4 inches (since the wall is 1 inch thick, subtract it from both length and width)
W = 6 - 1 = 5 inches
H = 4 - 1 = 3 inches

The volume of one box is:
V = L x W x H = 4 x 5 x 3 = 60 inches^3

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume is:
V_total = 3 x 60 = 180 inches^3

The answer is 180.

[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Frankie watches TV after he finishes his homework every night.  On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night.  On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show.  On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show.  On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes.  If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Let's break it down:

* On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 2*1 = 2 hours of TV. 7 - 2 = 5 hours left for the rest of the week. 
* On Wednesday, Frankie watched an unknown number of 30-minute episodes.  Since each episode is 30 minutes, he watched some number of episodes x 30 minutes.  We don't know x yet.  Calling this amount of minutes 'm', Frankie watched 30m minutes on Wednesday.  On Thursday, he watched a 1 hour episode (60 minutes) and a 30-minute episode.  So he watched 60 + 30 = 90 minutes on Thursday.  On Friday, he watched 2 1-hour episodes.   So he watched 2*60 = 120 minutes on Friday.   In total, Frankie watched 30m + 90 + 120 minutes.  We are given this total as 7 hours, which is 7 * 60 = 420 minutes.  Frankie watched a total of 30m + 90 + 120 minutes, which equals 420 minutes.   Now we have to isolate m.   30m + 90 + 120 = 420.   Simplify the right side to get 30m + 210 = 420, then subtract 210 to both sides to get 30m = 210.  Finally, divide both sides by 30 to get m = 7.  Frankie watched 7 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.   The answer is 7.

[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Henry started with some unknown number of cookies, which we'll call x.  This year, he wanted to bake twice as much, so he made 2x.  But, he baked 15 more cookies "by mistake".  So his total number of cookies is 2x + 15.  The total number of cookies he had left after dropping 5 is 110.  This means that 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.  We can simplify this to 2x + 10 = 110.  Subtract 10 from both sides to get 2x = 100.  Finally, divide both sides by 2 to get x = 50.  So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.  The answer is 50.

Let's call the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph x.   So, there are 50x photographs in Brittany's phone.  Since Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, we can set up the equation: 50x = 300.  Solve for x and you get x = 6.  So there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 116: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 1.  Sasha bought 2x4x10 boards for $10 each.  She bought 10 of them, so she spent 10 x 10 = 100 dollars.  she also bought 4x4x10 boards for $16 each.  She bought 5 of them, so she spent 5 x 16 = 80 dollars.   So in total, she spent 100 + 80 = 180 dollars. 
She wants to sell them, but prices have increased by 50% since she bought them.   That means the price of 2x4x10 boards increased from $10 to 10 x 1. 5 = 15.  The price of 4x4x10 boards increased from $16 to 16 x 1. 5 = 24.  She sold them all, so she got 10 x 15 = 150 dollars for the 2x4x10 boards and 5 x 24 = 120 dollars for the 4x4x10 boards.  So she got a total of 150 + 120 = 270 dollars.  Now, to find her profit, we need to subtract the amount she spent from the amount she got.   270 - 180 = 90.  The answer is 90.

[EXP] 117: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  Let's say the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used is 7x, and the number of cups of water is 13x (since the ratio is 7:13). 

We know the total number of teaspoons of sugar and cups of water is 120, so we can set up the equation:

7x + 13x = 120

Combine like terms:

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

So Katy used 6 units of the ratio.  Since the ratio is 7:13, the number of teaspoons of sugar Katy used is:

7x = 7(6) = 42

The answer is 42.

[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 95200, [output]:  Adrien's salary was originally 30% higher than Lylah's.  So if Adrien's original salary was $40,000, then Lylah's salary was 40,000 * (100/130) = 30,769. 

Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40% from his original salary, which is 40,000 * (140/100) = 56,000. 

If Lylah's salary also increased simultaneously, then we know that her salary increased by the same percentage from her original amount. 30,769 * (140/100) = 43,075.  After both salaries increased, Adrien's salary was 56,000 and Lylah's salary was 43,075.  Adding both salaries, we get the total salary of both: 56,000 + 43,075 = 99,075.  The answer is 99,075.

    orange_drink liters = 10

Here is the solution to the problem:

The orange drink is 2/3 water, so the water content in the orange drink is (2/3) * 10 = 20/3 liters. After pouring it into the pineapple drink, one liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the remaining water content is (20/3) - 1 = 7/3 liters. The pineapple drink is 3/5 water, so the water content in the pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters. The total water content in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water content in the orange drink and the pineapple drink, which is 7/3 + 9 = 25

    orange_drink_liters = 10

    orange_drink_water = (2/3) * orange_drink_liters

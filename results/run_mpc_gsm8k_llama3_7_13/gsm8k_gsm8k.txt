In this problem, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold 1/3 * X where X is the number of vacuum cleaners she started with. Then she sold 2 more at the red house. This means she had X - (1/3 * X) - 2 left. Then she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which means she sold (X - (1/3 * X) - 2) / 2. In total she sold 1/3 * X + 2 + (X - (1/3 * X) - 2) / 2 vacuum cleaners. This is equal to X - 5, since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. We can set up the equation:

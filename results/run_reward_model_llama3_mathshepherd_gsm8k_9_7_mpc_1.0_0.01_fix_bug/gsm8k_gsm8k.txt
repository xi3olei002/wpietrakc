[EXP] 1: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 1 glass of milk is 8 ounces of milk. 2 glasses of milk is 8 * 2 = 16 ounces of milk. 16 ounces of milk multiplied by the 3 calories per ounce is 16 x 3 = 48.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 2: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14400, [output]:  The builder works for 4 weeks every month.  There are 12 months in a year.  So the builder works for 4 * 12 = 48 weeks in a year.  The builder works 6 days each week.  So he works 48 * 6 = 288 days a year.  The builder gets paid $50 each day.  So if he works 288 days, he gets paid 288 * 50 = 14,400 dollars.  The answer is 14,400. 
[EXP] 3: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Since it's a quadruple batch, we need to multiply the normal recipe by 4. 3 cups of flour becomes 3 x 4 = 12 cups of flour.  1 cup of milk becomes 1 x 4 = 4 cups of milk.  Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and 12 divided by 2 is 6.  Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, and 4 divided by 2 is 2.   Mark has to buy 6 - 2 = 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 4: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 81, [output]: 900 watts is the energy used by the air conditioner per hour. 8 hours of usage per day means the energy used is 900 x 8 = 7200 watts per day. 

If the usage is reduced by 5 hours, the new energy used per day is 8 - 5 = 3 hours. 3 hours of usage, with the same 900 watts, will be 3 x 900 = 2700 watts. 

The daily energy saved will be 7200 - 2700 = 4500 watts. 30 days of usage will be 4500 x 30 = 135,000 watts or 135 kilowatts.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 5: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  Jane counted 2 zebras with 17 stripes each, so 2 x 17 = 34 stripes.  Then there was one more with 36 stripes.  And another with half of 36, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.  So the total number of stripes is 34 + 36 + 18 = 88.  To find the average, you divide the total by the number of zebras: 88 / 4 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 6: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Tyson needs to make 20/4 = 5 sandwiches, because each sandwich serves 4 people and there are 20 people in total.  Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, so he needs 5 pounds of meat and 5 pounds of cheese.  The meat costs $7 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost 5 x 7 = $35.  The cheese costs $3 per pound, so 5 pounds will cost 5 x 3 = $15.  In total, Tyson will spend $35 + $15 = $50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 7: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]: 40 cannolis originally. 60 cannolis were bought. 40 + 60 = 100 cannolis now.  There are twice as much corn as cannolis.  So the number of corns is 100 x 2 = 200.  But 40 fewer corns were bought, so the actual number of corns is 200 - 40 = 160.  The total is the number of corns plus the number of cannolis.  So, 160 + 100 = 260.   The answer is 260. 
[EXP] 8: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2000, [output]:  Elliott started with a goal of 10,000 steps.  He finished half of his steps on his walks, so that's 5,000.  He did an additional 1,000 steps walking with his friend.   So at this point, he has a total of 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 steps.   This leaves 10,000 - 6,000 = 4,000 steps left.  He only had 2,000 steps left after his jog.   So, he must have taken 4,000 - 2,000 = 2,000 steps during his jog.  The answer is 2,000. 
[EXP] 9: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 45 pages * 200 words a page = 9000 words. 9000 words / 300 words a minute = 30 minutes to read. 30 minutes + 10 minutes to the airport = 40 minutes in total. 60 minutes available - 40 minutes used = 20 minutes early.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 10: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168000, [output]: 40 employees were hired in May.  Each employee is paid 15 dollars per hour for 40 hours a week.  So each employee earned 15 * 40 = 600 dollars per week.  Since there are 4 weeks in may, each employee earned 600 * 4 = 2400 dollars.  The total amount paid to all 40 employees in may is 40 * 2400 = 96000 dollars. 

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, which means 40 * 1/4 = 10 employees left.  So the number of employees left is 40 - 10 = 30.  Each employee is paid the same as before, 15 * 40 = 600 dollars per week.  There are still 4 weeks in June, so each employee earned 600 * 4 = 2400 dollars.  The total amount paid to all 30 employees in June is 30 * 2400 = 72000 dollars.  To find the total amount paid to employees in the two months, we need to add the amount paid in May and June.  This is 96000 + 72000 = 168000.  The answer is 168000. 
[EXP] 11: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Sally had 10 dollars originally.  She bought 2 pounds of taffy.  For the first pound, it costs 3 dollars.  For the second pound, it says "get 1 pound 1/2 off".   1/2 of 3 is 1. 5 is 1. 5, so the second pound costs 1. 5.   Then she has to add them together: 3 + 1. 5 = 4. 5  So she spent 4. 5 dollars on taffy.  Then she spent 1. 5 on seashells and  4 x 0. 25 = 1  on magnets.  So in total she spent: 4. 5 + 1.  5 + 1  = 7.   As we subtract this from her original 10 dollars, we get 10 - 7 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 12: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1110, [output]:  Let's start by finding the value of the two packs of fireworks.  One package is worth $400, and the second one is worth twice that, so it is worth $800.  The total cost of the fireworks is $400 + $800 = $1200.  Since they got a 20% discount, the new price is 80% of the original price.   20% is the same as 1/5, so 80% is 4/5.  The total price is 4/5 of 1200, so 1200 * 4/5 = $960.  Finally, the finale firework costs 150 dollars.  The total cost is the sum of these two, which is 960 + 150 = $1110.  The answer is 1110. 
[EXP] 13: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Shannon eats 2 cookies a night, for a total of 2 x 30 = 60 cookies in 30 days.  1 dozen cookies is 12 cookies.  We want to find out how many dozens of cookies Shannon needs, so we need to divide the total number of cookies needed by 12.   60 divided by 12 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 14: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 5% of 50,000 candles have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. 5% of 50,000 is 5/100 x 50,000 = 2500.  

Let's focus on these 2500 candles. 99% of these candles are guaranteed not to explode. 1% of them will explode.  1% of 2500 is 1/100 x 2500 = 25.  So 25 of these 2500 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 15: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 56, [output]: 1) The blouses are 30% off, so Misha will pay 70% of the original price.  70% of $20 is $14.  2) If the discount applies to 4 blouses, then the total cost will be $14 x 4 = $56.  The answer is $56. 
[EXP] 16: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 350, [output]:  Joanne starts by gathering 30 apples from the tallest trees.  Her sister gathers twice as many, which is 30 x 2 = 60.  The total apples they gathered from tallest trees is 30 + 60 = 90 apples. 

Next, Joanne gathers half the amount from the shortest trees, which is 30 / 2 = 15.  Her sister gathers 3 times as many from the shortest trees, which is 15 x 3 = 45.  The total apples they gathered from the shortest trees is 15 + 45 = 60.  The total apples gathered now is 90 + 60 = 150.  Since the combined total of 500 apples is reached, they must have gathered 500 - 150 = 350 apples from the average trees.  Joanne gathered an equal amount, which is 350 / 2 = 175.  The answer is 175. 
[EXP] 17: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 56, [output]: 304 bumps is the sum of the number of humps of all the camels and dromedaries. 304 is equal to the number of camels * 2 (because camels have 2 humps) + the number of dromedaries * 1 (because dromedaries have 1 hump). 304 = x * 2 + y * 1.  We can solve this for y (the number of dromedaries).  We know there are 180 heads in total, which are the camels and dromedaries.  The equation becomes 304 = (180 - y) * 2 + y * 1.  We can simplify this to 304 = 360 - 2y + y.  Rearranging, we get 2y = 56.  So, y is equal to half of 56, which is 28.   The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3140, [output]:  Tom went on a two-week-long trip and spent seven days traveling.  Let's break this down:

Day 1 to 4: Tom travelled 200 kilometers every day for 4 days.  So he travelled 200 x 4 = 800 kilometers. 

Day 5 and 6: Tom travelled 30% of the distance travelled over the first 4 days, so 30% of 800 kilometers is 240 kilometers.  This means he travelled 240 kilometers over the next 2 days. 

Day 7: Tom didn't travel at all on this day. 

Day 8 to 14: Tom travelled 300 kilometers every day for 7 days. 300 x 7 = 2100 kilometers. 

To add up the total distance travelled, you just add these numbers together: 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100.  

800 + 240 is 1040. 1040 + 0 is 1040. 1040 + 2100 = 3140.  The answer is 3140. 
[EXP] 19: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 5 cubic inches is Peter's locker, and it's 1/4 as big as Zack's locker.  So Zack's locker is 5 * 4 = 20 cubic inches.  Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker.  So Timothy's locker is 20 * 2 = 40 cubic inches.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 20: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 3000, [output]:  Stanley was 10,000 feet high and lost a comb 4,000 feet down, which means the comb is now at 6,000 feet.  Oliver needs to climb from 3,000 to 6,000 feet.  6,000 - 3,000 is 3,000.  The answer is 3,000. 
[EXP] 21: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17000, [output]:  Mr.  Josue started with 5000 in capital.  The first bank gave him 4000.  The second bank gave him twice as much as the first bank, so that's 2 x 4000 = 8000 dollars.  He now has 5000 + 4000 + 8000 = 17000.   The answer is 17000. 
[EXP] 22: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 50 cats originally were on the rock.  Each of the 4 boats took 5 cats away, so 4 * 5 = 20 cats were taken away. 50 - 20 = 30 cats remained.  Then, 3/5 of the remaining 30 cats ran after the mouse, which is 30 * (3/5) = 18 cats.  So 30 - 18 = 12 cats remain.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 23: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 284, [output]:  Bill pays $8 a month for the first 6 months, which is a total of 6 x 8 = 48 dollars.  Then he pays $12 a month for the next 8 months, which is 8 x 12 = 96 dollars.  After that, the price goes up to $14 a month.  Since there are 12 months in a year and 24 months in 2 years, Bill pays 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months at $14 a month, so that is 10 x 14 = 140 dollars.  So the total cost of 2 years of the service is 48 + 96 + 140 = 284.  The answer is 284. 
[EXP] 24: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.  So, the jogger jeans cost $28 - $6 = $22. 

2.  Cole saved a total of $6. 1/3 of this was from the jogger jeans. 1/3 of $6 is $2.  So, $6 - $2 = $4 was saved from the tattered jeans.  This means that the tattered jeans originally cost $28 - $4 = $24.  Since we know the jogger jeans cost $22, the difference is $24 - $22 = $2.  So, the jogger jeans originally cost $2 more than the tattered jeans.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 25: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 570, [output]: 4 buses that can hold 60 employees can hold 4 * 60 = 240 employees.  6 minibusses that can hold 30 employees can hold 6 * 30 = 180 employees.  10 minivans that can hold 15 employees can hold 10 * 15 = 150 employees.  The total capacity is 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 employees.  The answer is 570. 
[EXP] 26: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many bird feeders Lillian has in total.  She builds 3 and buys 3, so she now has 3 + 3 = 6 bird feeders.  Half of these are store-bought, which means she has 3 store-bought and 3 homemade bird feeders.  The store-bought feeders attract 20 birds each day and the homemade ones attract 20 + 10 = 30 birds each day.  Since there are 3 store-bought feeders, that's 3 x 20 = 60 birds attracted by the store-bought feeders.   Since there are 3 homemade feeders, that's 3 x 30 = 90 birds attracted by the homemade feeders.  In total, Lillian can expect to see 60 + 90 = 150 birds in her garden each day.  The answer is 150. 
[EXP] 27: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Aleksandra ordered soup, a bagel, and a piece of cake.  The bagel cost $4.  The soup costs 25% more.  25% of 4 is 1.  1 + 4 is 5.  So the soup costs $5.   The cake is half the price of the bagel.  Half of $4 is 2.  So the cake costs $2.    In total, Aleksandra needs to pay $4 + $5 + $2.  This is $11.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

1.  Kenny wants to use his Pokémon cards to buy a ticket to an amusement park, which costs $100.  This means he needs $100 in total. 
2.  He sells his Pokémon cards for $1. 5 each.  To find out how many cards he sold, we need to know the amount of money he spent.  
3.   He had $50 in spending cash.   So, he sold Pokémon cards for the rest of the money, which is $100 - $50 = $50.  
4.   Since each card is $1. 5, the number of cards he sold is $50 / $1.  5 = 33.   But he keeps 1/3 of the cards, so he sells 2/3 of the total number of cards. 
5.  Let's call the total number of cards he had "n".  If he keeps 1/3, then he sells 2/3.    We know he sells 33 cards.    2/3 of "n" is equal to 33.  We can rewrite this as (2/3)n = 33.  Now we need to find out what "n" is.   To do this, we multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction.    (2/3)n * 3 = 33 * 3. 
[EXP] 29: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 26, [output]: 36 guests were originally expected. 36 guests would eat one hotdog each.  But the caterer prepared hotdogs for 36 / 2 = 18 guests to have 2 hotdogs each, in addition to the 36 guests.  This means the caterer prepared hotdogs for 18 + 36 = 54 guests.  Although 40 guests showed up, the 4 extra guests would be the ones who did not get a second hotdog.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Indras has 6 letters in her name.  Half of 6 letters is 6/2 = 3. 4 more letters than 3 is 3 + 4 = 7.  So, Indras' sister has 7 letters.   Indras has 6 letters. 6 + 7 = 13.   The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 132, [output]:  Charlotte wants a set of pot and pans for $120, a set of mixing bowls for $20, and 5 separate utensils for $5 each. 5 x 5 = 25, so the cost of the utensils is 25 dollars.  So, the total cost before the discount is 120 + 20 + 25 = 165.  Then, since it's 20% off, we need to calculate 20% of 165.  20% is the same as 1/5, so we can do 165 / 5 = 33.  So 33 is the discount amount, and 165 - 33 = 132 is the total after the discount.  The answer is 132. 
[EXP] 32: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Dora has 2 dollars from her allowance and 16 dollars from her mother, so she has 2 + 16 = 18 dollars.  The skipping rope costs 6 dollars, the board game costs 11 dollars, and the playground ball costs 2 dollars.  The total cost of all three is 6 + 11 + 2 = 19 dollars.  She has 18 dollars, so she needs 19 - 18 = 1 dollar.  She needs 1 dollar more.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 33: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Prince Thaddeus slew 100 dragons.  Prince Arthur slew three quarters as many, so 100 / 4 * 3 = 75.  Prince Walter slew twice as many as Prince Arthur, so 75 * 2 = 150.  Prince Bruce slew one fifth as many as Prince Walter, so 150 / 5 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 34: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 15 gallons of gas are divided into 5 containers. 15 / 5 = 3 gallons per container.  There are 8 pints in a gallon, so there are 8 * 3 = 24 pints in a container.  If Josey needs 1/4 of a container, then she needs 24 * 1/4 = 6 pints of gasoline.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 35: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  There are 100 cents in 1 dollar, so $5 is 500 cents.  If George had 1% left, then he had 1% of 500 cents or 5 cents left.  So he spent 500 - 5 = 495 cents.  The chips cost 40 cents each.   Since he bought 3 bags, he spent 3 x 40 = 120 cents on chips.  That leaves 495 - 120 = 375 cents.   Candy bars are 75 cents each.  To find out how many he bought, divide 375 cents by 75 cents. 375/75 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 36: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Ray started with 25 lollipops.  He kept 5 for himself, so he has 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops to share with his friends.  Since his friends are 4, he will divide 20 lollipops equally among them.  20 divided by 4 is 5.   So each of his friends received 5 lollipops.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 37: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 15, [output]: 20 ounces cake, cut into 8 pieces.  So each piece is 20 ÷ 8 = 2. 5 pieces remain (since Rory and her mom already took one each). 5 pieces * 2 ounces each = 10 ounces.  The cake remaining weighs 10 ounces.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 38: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 34 oranges + 22 oranges = 56 oranges.  Since 8 friends (including Sitti and Juris) want to share equally, we need to divide 56 by 8.  56 ÷ 8 is 7.  The answer is 7 oranges per person. 
[EXP] 39: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Antoine wants to use double the amount of onions, so he needs 4 pounds of onions.  Each pound of onions costs $2, so the total cost of onions is 4 x 2 = $8. 

Antoine also needs 2 boxes of beef stock.  Each box costs $2, so the total cost of beef stock is 2 x 2 = $4. 

The total cost is the cost of onions plus the cost of beef stock, which is $8 + $4 = $12.  This cost is for the ingredients for 6 servings of soup.  To find the cost per serving, divide the total cost by the number of servings.  $12 / 6 = $2.  Round to the nearest integer, the answer is 2. 
[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 17, [output]: 5 minutes earlier

Solution: Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and the drive from Wayne's hotel takes 4 minutes.  Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long, Bernadette's drive will take 4 * 4 = 16 minutes.  Bernadette should leave 5 minutes earlier than Wayne, who will be arriving at the 4-minute mark, to ensure she arrives 5 minutes before Wayne.  So Bernadette should leave at the 0-minute mark, or one minute before Wayne.  The answer is 1 minute earlier. 
[EXP] 41: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 98, [output]: 1 yard is 3 feet, so the length of Billie's room is 3 * 3 = 9 feet.  We know the area is 360 square feet.  To find the width, we divide 360 by the length: 360 ÷ 9 = 40.  The width is 40 feet. 

The formula for perimeter is: P = 2(l + w), where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.  Plugging in the values, P = 2(9 + 40) = 2 * 49 = 98.  The answer is 98. 
[EXP] 42: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's calculate the total number of beads each sister has:

Elizabeth has 1 pack of red beads (20 pieces) and 2 packs of clear beads (20 x 2 = 40 pieces). 20 + 40 = 60 beads. 
Margareth has 3 packs of blue beads (20 x 3 = 60 pieces) and 4 packs of red beads (20 x 4 = 80 pieces). 60 + 80 = 140 beads. 

Elizabeth has 60 beads, and Margareth has 140 beads. 140 - 60 = 80 beads.  Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 43: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 49, [output]: 40 degrees is the house's initial temperature. 3 hours of baking with the oven on raises the temperature by 5 degrees per hour, so the total temperature increase is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.  So, the house's temperature becomes 40 + 15 = 55 degrees.  Then, the window is open for 30 minutes.  The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.  So, after 30 minutes, the rate of cooling is 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.  The house's final temperature is 55 - 6 = 49 degrees.  The answer is 49. 
[EXP] 44: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 59, [output]:  Let's break down the times for Jon:
- Swim: 40 minutes
- Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes
- Run: 50 minutes
Total time: 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 minutes

James is 10% faster in the swim, which means he took 40 * (1 - 0. 1) = 36 minutes.  He takes 5 minutes longer on the bike, which means he took 80 + 5 = 85 minutes.   To find out how long James took to do the run, we need to know the total time difference between James and Jon.   We know this is 10 minutes, so James' total time must be 170 - 10 = 160 minutes.   The bike and swim take up 36 + 85 = 121 minutes, so the remaining time must be the run time.  160 - 121 = 39 minutes.  The answer is 39. 
[EXP] 45: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's start with Movie C.  It is 1. 25 hours, which is equivalent to 1. 25 x 60 = 75 minutes.  Since Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, Movie B is 75 + 5 = 80 minutes.  If Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B, then Movie A is 80 / 4 = 20 minutes.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 46: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 1/2 a bail of hay is needed for 1 mile. 1 mile at 32MPH is 1/32. 30 minutes at 32MPH is 30/60 x 32 = 16 miles. 16 miles * 1/2 a bail of hay means he needs 8 bails of hay. 8 bails of hay will cost 8 x 3 = 24 dollars.  Michael has 6 x 5 dollar bills, which is 30 dollars in total. 30 - 24 = 6.  So Michael will have 6 dollars in change.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 47: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 4 dozen means 4 * 12 = 48 eggs.  Add to that the 2 loose eggs, for a total of 48 + 2 = 50 eggs.  If each glass needs 5 eggs, and each tray holds 5 glasses, then 1 tray needs 5 * 5 = 25 eggs.  So Rozanne can put out as many trays as the total number of eggs is a multiple of 25.  She has 50 eggs, which is 50 / 25 = 2 trays full, with 0 left over.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 48: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Joey started with 214 points.  He scored 26 points.  So he has 214 + 26 = 240 points now.

[EXP] 51: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  You can buy a movie ticket for 12 dollars, then add the cost of popcorn and soda.   You saved 2 dollars by not buying the super ticket.   So the regular cost of popcorn and soda, plus 12 dollars, must equal 20, which is the cost of the super ticket.  This can be represented mathematically as an equation: 12 + popcorn + soda - 2 = 20. 

  First, get all the constant terms on one side: 12 - 2 = 10.  So now the equation is popcorn + soda = 10. 

  We know soda costs 3 dollars, so you can plug in soda = 3:  popcorn + 3 = 10.  Subtract 3 from both sides:  popcorn = 10 - 3.   10 - 3 is 7.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 52: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11050, [output]:  First, let's find out how much a balloon costs before the price increase.  Since the total cost of filling 20 balloons is $900, we can find the cost of one balloon by dividing 900 by 20:

900 ÷ 20 = $45

So, the cost of one balloon is $45 before the price increase. 

Now, let's find out how much each balloon costs after the price increase.  The cost increased by $20 per balloon.  So, the new cost of each balloon is:

$45 + 20 = $65

Bentley wants to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.  We know that each balloon costs $65.  We can multiply 170 by 65 to find out the total cost:

170 x 65 = $11,050

The answer is 11,050. 
[EXP] 53: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's first calculate the total distance traveled.  The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, so it travels 60 * 2 = 120 miles.  Then, it drives at 30 mph for 1 hour, so it travels 30 * 1 = 30 miles.  In total, it travels 120 + 30 = 150 miles.  The average speed is total distance divided by total time.  The total time is 2 + 1 = 3 hours.  So the average speed is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 54: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6400, [output]:  Jenna started with 8 sapphires.  She traded 3 for 2 rubies, so she is left with 8 - 3 = 5 sapphires.  Rubies are worth $1200 each, so the 2 rubies she got are worth 2 x 1200 = 2400.  Sapphires are worth $800 each, so the 5 sapphires she still has are worth 5 x 800 = 4000.   In total, the jewels are worth 4000 + 2400 = 6400.  The answer is 6400.

[EXP] 57: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]:  Let's start by finding the number of green cards. 60% more than the number of red cards means that the number of green cards is 15 + (15 * 0. 60) = 15 + (15 * 0. 6) = 15 + 9 = 24.   Since yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards, the number of yellow cards is 15 + 24 = 39.  In total, there are 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 cards.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 58: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Katelyn originally saw 50 fairies. 

Then her friend saw half as many, which is 50/2 = 25, flying from the east and join the rest. 50 + 25 = 75, so there are 75 fairies now. 10 minutes later, 30 fairies flew away.  

To find the number of fairies remaining, we subtract 30 from 75.  
75 - 30 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 59: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  Let's first count the total number of puppies: 8 puppies with Jennifer's dog + 12 puppies with Brandon's dog = 20 puppies in total.  Now, let's count the number of puppies that have spots: 3 puppies with Jennifer's dog + 4 puppies with Brandon's dog = 7 puppies with spots.   To find the percentage of puppies that have spots, we can use the following formula: percentage = (number of puppies with spots / total number of puppies) * 100 = (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%.  The answer is 35%. 
[EXP] 60: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  First, let's calculate the total weight of the feed:. 4 12-pound bags of carrots is 4 x 12 = 48 pounds.  2 1-pound boxes of sugar cubes is 2 x 1 = 2 pounds.  42 75-pound bales of hay is 42 x 75 = 3150 pounds.  20 65-pound sacks of oats is 20 x 65 = 1300 pounds.  The total weight is 3150 + 1300 + 48 + 2 = 4500 pounds.  The farm truck can only carry 2250 pounds at a time, so we need to find how many times we can fill the truck.  4500 divided by 2250 is 2.  The farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 61: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 84, [output]:  First, let's calculate the earnings from recycling cans.  Grayson drinks 3 cans a week and each can is worth 2 cents.  So in one week, she earns 3 x 2 = 6 cents.   In a four-week month, she earns 4 x 6 = 24 cents from recycling cans. 
Next, let's calculate the earnings from recycling plastic bottles.   Grayson drinks 5 bottles a week and each bottle is worth 3 cents.   So in one week, she earns 5 x 3 = 15 cents.   In a four-week month, she earns 4 x 15 = 60 cents from recycling plastic bottles.  In total, Grayson earns 24 cents from recycling cans and 60 cents from recycling plastic bottles.   The answer is 84. 
[EXP] 62: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Let's first find out how many plants Toni has.  Frederick has 10 plants, and Toni has 60% more.

[EXP] 73: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Matt wants to eat 5 cookies.  In total, he can have half as many cookies as carrot sticks, plus 2 extra.  Let's call the number of carrot sticks x.  So, the number of cookies he gets is (1/2) x + 2.  

Since he wants to eat 5 cookies in total, we can set up the equation: (1/2) x + 2 = 5 

To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (1/2) x = 5 - 2 

(1/2) x = 3 

Now, we multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

x = 3 * 2 

x = 6 

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks to get 5 cookies.  The answer is 6.

[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Heather wants to buy 2 packs of razors.  Each pack has 4 razors.  So she needs 2 * 4 = 8 razors. 

The normal price is 4 dollars per pack.  The buy one get one free deal means she can get 2 packs for the price of one.  So she effectively gets 8 razors for the price of 4.  4 dollars is 400 cents. 

She also has a 2 dollar coupon.   This is 200 cents. 

So the total cost is 400 - 200 = 200 cents.  

This is 200 cents for 8 razors.  So each razor will cost 200 / 8 = 25 cents.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 95: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 21, [output]: 9 cheerleaders are 64" each. 64 * 9 = 576".  The 10th cheerleader is 60".  So in total the cheerleaders are 576 + 60 = 636". 

We need to find the height of the human pyramid.  The shortest girl is at the top.  She is 60" tall.  On top of her, there are 2 girls who are 64" tall.   So the total height of the bottom 2 girls is 2 * 64 = 128".  This stack is on top of the 3 girls, who are also 64" tall.   So the total height of these 3 is 3 * 64 = 192".  This stack is on top of the 4 girls, who are the bottom level.   They are also 64" tall.   So the total height of the 4 girls is 4 * 64 = 256".  

We can now add these to find the height of the pyramid: 60 + 128 + 192 + 256 = 636.  Since we have already found that the total height of all the cheerleaders is 636", this must be the height of the pyramid in inches.  

To convert this to feet, we divide by 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot. 636 / 12 is 53.  The answer is 53.

[EXP] 100: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, and food will cost $5 per person.  So the total cost at the first venue will be $200 + (number of guests) * $5.  The second venue charges $25 per person, and food is included.  So the total cost at the second venue will be (number of guests) * $25.  The first venue will be equal to the second if:
$200 + (number of guests) * $5 = (number of guests) * $25
Solve for the number of guests:
(number of guests) * ($25 - $5) = $200
(number of guests) * $20 = $200
(number of guests) = $200 / $20
(number of guests) = 10
The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 101: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  We know Lily, David, and Bodhi found 43 insects in total.  We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

L + D + B = 43

We know Lily found 7 more insects than David, so we can write an equation for Lily's insects:

L = D + 7

We also know that David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can write an equation for David's insects:

D = B/2

Now we can substitute the equations for D into the first equation:

(L = D + 7) -> L = (B/2) + 7

Substitute this expression for L into the first equation:

(B/2) + 7 + D + B = 43

Simplify the equation:

B/2 + D + B = 43 - 7
B/2 + D + B = 36

Now we need to find the value of B.  Let's start by solving for D:

D = B/2

Substitute this expression for D into the equation:

B/2 + (B/2) + B = 36

Combine like terms:

2B/2 + B = 36

Combine like terms:

3B/2 = 36

Multiply both sides by 2:

3B = 72

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 24

Now that we know B, we can find D:

D = B/2
= 24/2
= 12

Finally, we can find L:

L = D + 7
= 12 + 7
= 19

So Lily found 19 insects.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 102: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 273, [output]: 1/4 of a skein is the same as 1/4 x 364 = 91 yards. 1/2 of a skein is the same as 1/2 x 364 = 182 yards.  In total, they used 91 + 182 = 273 yards.  The answer is 273. 
[EXP] 103: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 2 of Cherrie's friends want 5 gifts each, so she needs 2 x 5 = 10 gifts for them. 3 other friends want 2 gifts each, so she needs 3 x 2 = 6 gifts for them. 10 + 6 = 16 gifts so far. 10 more random gifts make a total of 16 + 10 = 26.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 104: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Let's start with the chair.  It is 3 feet wide.  The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.  So the rug is 3 + 5 = 8 feet wide. 

The couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug.  Twice the width of the rug is 2 * 8 = 16 feet.  The couch is 2 feet longer than that, so the couch is 16 + 2 = 18 feet long.  

The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 105: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Suzie paid 7 dollars in total.  Let's first find the total cost of all the other packs: a pack of grape gum cost 2 dollars, and a small pack of green apple gum costs half as much, which is 2 / 2 = 1 dollar.  In total, 1 + 2 = 3 dollars.  Now, if the total cost is 7 dollars, the cost of the two packs of strawberry gum is 7 - 3 = 4 dollars.  Since there are two packs of strawberry gum, each pack costs 4 / 2 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 106: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1,600, [output]:  Let's find how many sticks Frederick can make from each type of wood.  From a 2 x 4, he can get 200 sticks and it costs $4, so the cost per stick is 4 / 200 = 0. 02 dollars per stick.  From a 2 x 8, he can get 400 sticks and it costs $6, so the cost per stick is 6 / 400 = 0. 015 dollars per stick.   Since the 2 x 4 is cheaper, Frederick will buy the 2 x 4 and use the $24 to buy lumber.  

We need to find how many 2 x 4's Frederick can buy with $24.  If each costs $4, he can buy $24 / 4 = 6.  So he can buy 6 2 x 4's.  Each 2 x 4 gets him 200 sticks, so in total he can make 6 * 200 = 1200 sticks.  The answer is 1200. 
[EXP] 107: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]: 6 sled dogs with 4 legs each means that there are 6 x 4 = 24 legs that need snowshoes. 2 snowshoes for 1 leg means there are 24 / 2 = 12 pairs of snowshoes required.  Each pair of snowshoes costs 12 dollars, so 12 pairs will cost 12 x 12 = 144 dollars.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 108: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Janet takes 2 bus trips a day for 5 days a week. 2 * 5 = 10.  So she takes 10 bus trips in a week. 10 trips at $2. 20 each is 2. 20 * 10 = 22.  So she spends 22 dollars a week.  She can buy a pass for $20.   She would save 22 - 20 = 2 dollars a week.  The answer is 2 dollars. 
[EXP] 109: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

The farm has 30 cows, and the zoo has twice as many cows as the farm.  So, the zoo has 2 x 30 = 60 cows. 

The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.   The zoo has 20 sheep, so the farm has half of that, which is 20 ÷ 2 = 10 sheep.  Therefore, the farm has 30 cows and 10 sheep in total, which is 30 + 10 = 40 animals.  The zoo has 60 cows and 20 sheep in total, which is 60 + 20 = 80 animals.  To find the total number of animals the farm and zoo have together, we add 40 + 80.  40 + 80 is 120.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's say Sophia bought X onions and potatoes.  Then Rose bought 4 times as many, which is 4X.  Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, so 12 + 4 = 16 items in total.   Since it's given that 16 is 4X, we can write the equation:
```
4X = 16
```
To solve for X, we simply divide both sides by 4:
```
X = 16 / 4
X = 4
```
So Sophia bought 4 onions and potatoes.  Since she bought the same quantity of onions and potatoes, we can say she bought 2 of each.  Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 2 onions and 2 potatoes.  The answer is 2 onions and 2 potatoes. 
[EXP] 111: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 525, [output]: 30 lbs is 30 x 3500 = 105,000 calories.  There are 306 days between December 31st and July 19th.  105,000 calories / 306 days is approximately 343 calories per day.  This is the consumption level, so to achieve a deficit, he needs to have a lower consumption.  A daily deficit of 343 calories should be his target.  The answer is 343. 
[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Gerald makes 30 dollars a day. 30 dollars a day for 7 days (a whole week) is 30 x 7 = 210 dollars.  He spent a total of 100 dollars.  So, he has 210 - 100 dollars left. 210 - 100 is 110.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 0. 25 km is 1/4 km. 8 laps means 8 x (1/4) = 2 km. 2 kilometers will need 2 * 60 = 120 ml of water. 120 ml of water.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 114: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Julie originally had 500 dollars. 20% of it is 20/100 * 500 = 100 dollars.  So she spent 100 dollars on clothes. 500 - 100 = 400 dollars left.  Then she spent 25% of the remaining 400 on CDs. 25/100 * 400 = 100 dollars. 100 dollars from the remaining 400 means she now has 400 - 100 = 300 dollars left.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 115: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 90000, [output]:  Let's call the cost of the lot x.  Then, the cost of the house is 3x.  The total cost of the house and lot is 120,000.  We can set up the equation:
x + 3x = 120,000
Combine like terms:
4x = 120,000
Divide both sides by 4:
x = 30,000
The cost of the lot is 30,000.  The cost of the house is three times this, so it is 3x = 3(30,000) = 90,000.  The answer is 90,000.

[EXP] 120: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 280, [output]:  Rob takes 2 hours. 2 hours is 2 x 60 = 120 minutes. 40 minutes more than double Rob, means 2 x 120 = 240 minutes, then we have to add 40 minutes. 240 + 40 = 280.  The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 121: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 63, [output]:  Since there are 3 grandchildren, Martha needs to make each item 3 times.  A hat needs 2 skeins, so 3 hats would need 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.  A scarf needs 4 skeins, so 3 scarves would need 4 * 3 = 12 skeins.  A sweater needs 12 skeins, so 3 sweaters would need 12 * 3 = 36 skeins.  A pair of mittens needs 1 skein, so 3 pairs would need 1 * 3 = 3 skeins.  A pair of socks needs 2 skeins, so 3 pairs would need 2 * 3 = 6 skeins.  All together, Martha will need 6 + 12 + 36 + 3 + 6 = 63 skeins of wool.  The answer is 63. 
[EXP] 122: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 39, [output]:  Chris started with 100 problems.  After completing 12 problems on Monday, he had 100 - 12 = 88 left.  On Tuesday, he completed 3 times as many problems as on Monday, which is 3 * 12 = 36. 88 - 36 = 52.  On Wednesday, he completed 1/4 of the remaining, which is (1/4) * 52 = 13.  52 - 13 = 39.  So, on Thursday he must complete 39 more problems.  The answer is 39. 
[EXP] 123: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  First, we find how many quarts each person can pick per hour.  Tony can pick 6 quarts per hour.  Bobby can pick one less quart than Tony, which is 6 - 1 = 5 quarts per hour.  Kathy picks twice as much as Bobby, which is 5 * 2 = 10 quarts per hour.  Ricky picks two fewer quarts than Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts per hour.  Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick a total of 6 + 5 + 8 + 10 = 29 quarts per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 124: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 74, [output]: 200 loaves were baked. 93 loaves were sold in the morning. 39 more loaves were sold in the afternoon.  In total, they sold 93 + 39 = 132 loaves. 132 loaves were sold, and 6 loaves were returned.  So, they actually sold 132 - 6 = 126 loaves. 200 loaves were baked, and they sold 126 loaves.  To find out how many loaves they have left, subtract 126 from 200. 200 - 126 = 74.  The answer is 74. 
[EXP] 125: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 36 red tulips and 24 blue tulips.  To find out how many rows of red tulips Jackson can plant, we divide 36 by 6, which is 6 rows.  To find out how many rows of blue tulips he can plant, we divide 24 by 8, which is 3 rows.  Since red and blue tulips are in separate rows, we can't combine them to form rows, so we count each type separately.  The answer is 6 + 3 = 9. 
[EXP] 126: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 27 cups of raisins are in the bag. 3/4 cup of raisins are needed for each batch of oatmeal cookies.  To find out how many batches she can make, we can divide the number of cups of raisins by the number of cups needed for a batch:

27 cups ÷ 3/4 cup/batch = ?

To divide a fraction by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal.  The reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3.  So:

27 cups * (4/3) ÷ 3/4 = ?

Now simplify the expression by multiplying the numerators and denominators:

27 * 4 ÷ 3 * 4 = ?

Now perform the division:

108 ÷ 12 = 9

So, Heather can make 9 batches of oatmeal cookies with the raisins.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 127: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Ada's daily electric consumption is 12 kilowatts per hour.  She uses 1 hour a day, so her daily consumption is 12 dollars.  Since there are 7 days in a week, her weekly consumption is 12 * 7 = 84 dollars. 

Now, she adds a device that will consume 2 kilowatts per hour a day.  Her new daily consumption is 12 + 2 = 14 kilowatts per hour.   Since there are 7 days in a week, her new weekly consumption is 14 * 7 = 98 dollars. 

The difference between her weekly electrical bill before and after adding the device is 98 - 84 = 14 dollars.  The answer is 14 dollars. 
[EXP] 128: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 1 person can paint half a house in 5 days.  It will take 10 days for 1 person to paint the whole house.

So in 2 days, they would work 2 * 24 = 48 hours.   The answer is 48 hours. 
[EXP] 129: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 172, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.  If Ophelia has 20 sofas, then she must have 20 + 2 = 22 chairs. 

Next, the problem states that Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.  So Jenna has 22 x 3 = 66 chairs.  Then Jenna has 2 fewer chairs than sofas, so Jenna has 66 + 2 = 68 sofas. 

To find the total number of sofas and chairs, we add Ophelia's sofas and chairs, then add Jenna's sofas and chairs.  Ophelia has 20 sofas and 22 chairs, for a total of 20 + 22 = 42 pieces of furniture.  Jenna has 68 sofas and 66 chairs, for a total of 68 + 66 = 134 pieces of furniture.  Adding the two totals, Ophelia and Jenna have 42 + 134 = 176 pieces of furniture.  The answer is 176.

[EXP] 131: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 36, [output]:  In total, Josh spent 8 weeks working out. 8 - 2 = 6 weeks where he spent only 4 hours each.  6 * 4 = 24 hours.  Then, there were 2 weeks where he spent 5 hours each.  2 * 5 = 10 hours.  Then, there was one week where he spent 6 hours.  1 * 6 = 6 hours.  24 + 10 + 6 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 132: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 66, [output]: 48 people are originally riding the bus.  On the first stop, 8 people get off.  So there are 48 - 8 = 40 people left.  The number of people who get in is 5 times the number who got off, which is 5 x 8 = 40.  So the total number of people on the bus becomes 40 + 40 = 80. 

On the second stop, 21 people get off.  So there are 80 - 21 = 59 people left.  The number of people who get on is 3 times fewer people than the number who got off, which is 21 / 3 = 7.  So 7 people get in, and now there are 59 + 7 = 66 people on the bus.  The answer is 66. 
[EXP] 133: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Jame will be 27 years old in 5 years.   In 5 years, his age now will be 27 - 5 = 22.  In 8 years, he'll be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.  His cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age.  Twice his age in 8 years will be 2 x 30 = 60 years.  And 5 years younger than that is 60 - 5 = 55.  The difference in age between the two is 55 - 30 = 25.  So, 5 years separate their age now.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Errol paid a total of $2400 for the computer, 2 monitors, and a printer.  The computer costs $1,100.  He paid $400 less for the printer than for the computer, so the printer costs $1,100 - $400 = $700.  We know the total cost is 2400, so subtracting the cost of the computer and the cost of the printer from 2400, we get:
2400 - 1100 - 700 = 600
The 600 is the cost of the 2 monitors, so each monitor costs 600 / 2 = 300 dollars.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 135: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]: 20 kids went out.  Then they were divided into 2 equal groups.  That means each group has 10 kids.  Since the boys and girls are in equal groups, we can say that there are 10 boys and 10 girls.  The boys brought 60 shells each.  So together the boys brought 10 x 60 = 600 shells.  The girls brought shells equal to the number of shells the boys brought plus four times as many as the boys.   The number of shells the boys brought is 600.  Four times as many as the boys is 4 x 600 = 2400.   So the number of shells the girls brought is 600 + 2400 = 3000.  The girls are in a group of 10.  To find out how many shells each girl brought, we need to divide 3000 by 10.   3000 divided by 10 is 300.  The answer is 300.

Then George eats 5 candies, so George has x - 5 candies left.  This is given to be 3 candies, so x - 5 = 3.  x = 8.  So George has 8 candies originally.  Then Nick has 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 candies.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 137: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Since Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny, Alyana's age is 10 - 4 = 6.  Since Anne is 2 years older than Alyana, Anne's age is 6 + 2 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 138: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 188, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  The first book is 31 mm thick. 
2.  The second book is 50 mm thick. 
3.  The third book is 5 mm less thick than the second book, so it's 50 - 5 = 45 mm thick. 
4.  The fourth book is twice as thick as the first book, so it's 2 x 31 = 62 mm thick.  

Now, we can add the thickness of all the books to find the total thickness:

31 + 50 + 45 + 62 = 188 mm

The answer is 188.

Jenny earns $0.  5 for each task and gets 20 tasks done, so she earns 20 x $0.  5 = $10.  Jairus gets $16 and Jenny gets $10, so Jairus gets $16 - $10 = $6 more than Jenny.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 145: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let us start with the fact that Brad's money and Jeff's money add up to 100 dollars.  Let's say Brad gets X dollars.   Then Jeff will get 4X dollars since Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad.  So, X + 4X = 100.  We can simplify this equation to get 5X = 100.   Then, divide both sides by 5 to get X = 20.  This means that Brad gets 20 dollars.  Now we can find out how much Jeff gets.   Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad, so he gets 4 x 20 = 80 dollars.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 146: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Each day Jeff walks there and back, which is 3 + 3 = 6 miles.  Then since he has to work 5 days a week, he walks 6 * 5 = 30 miles.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130, [output]:  Elise writes the alphabet in full twice, which is 26 letters for each time. 26 + 26 = 52.  Then she writes half of the alphabet, which is 13 letters.  52 + 13 is 65.  Finally, she rewrites everything she has already written, which is 65 letters again. 65 + 65 is 130.  The answer is 130. 
[EXP] 148: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 81, [output]:  We will break down the problem step by step.  On the first round, Ali called 3 families.   On the second round, each of those 3 families called 3 more families each.  So 3 x 3 = 9 more families were called.  Now we have a total of 3 + 9 = 12 families.   On the third round, each of those 12 families calls 3 more families each.  So 12 x 3 = 36 more families were called.   Now we have a total of 12 + 36 = 48 families.  On the fourth round, each of those 48 families call 3 more.   48 x 3 = 144.   The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 149: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Mark was unwell for 3 months. 10 pounds per month means he lost a total of 10 * 3 = 30 pounds. 30 pounds off his final weight 70 pounds means his initial weight was 70 + 30 = 100 pounds.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 150: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 398, [output]:  Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has.  This is telling us that he needs to have the number of toys he already has, plus 2.  This number needs to be 5 times greater than the 80 toys James has.  So let's start with James' toys: 80.  5 times greater means 5 x 80 = 400 toys.  Since we know that this is the amount Jonathan needs to have, and it's 2 more than he already has, let's call the number of toys he has currently x.  Then  x + 2 = 400.  To find out how many toys Jonathan currently has, we have to isolate x: x + 2 = 400, subtract 2 from both sides: x = 400 - 2, x = 398.  The answer is 398. 
[EXP] 151: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Daniel wants to buy 5 notebooks, 2 pens, 1 calculator, and 1 geometry set.  

First, we need to calculate the cost of each item:

5 notebooks x $1. 50 each = 5 x 1. 50 = $7. 50
2 pens x $0. 25 each = 2 x 0. 25 = $0.  50
1 calculator x $12. 00 = $12. 00
1 geometry set x $10.  00 = $10.   00
Total cost before discount: $7.  50 + $0.  50 + $12.  00 + $10.  00 = $30.   00


Now we need to apply the 10% discount:

$30. 00 x 0. 10 (10% discount) = $3. 00
So, the discount is $3.  The total amount Daniel has to spend is:
$30. 00 - $3.  00 = $27.    00


The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 152: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]: 50 dollars bill. 

First, let's find out how much Carly spends. 
Five hamburgers cost 5 x 4 = 20 dollars. 
Ten packs of fries cost 10 x 0. 30 = 3 dollars.  
Five cans of fruit drinks cost 5 x 2 = 10 dollars.  
So, Carly spends 20 + 3 + 10 dollars.  20 + 3 + 10 = 33 dollars.  

Carly paid with a 50 dollars bill. 50 - 33 dollars is 17 dollars.  Carly gets 17 dollars in change.  The answer is 17 '">'. 
[EXP] 153: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 450, [output]:  Antonella sold $2500 worth of goods. 30% of $1000 is $300, so for the first $1000, she earns a commission of $300.  For the additional $1500 ($2500 - $1000), she earns 10% of that. 10% of $1500 is $150.  So in total, her commission is $300 + $150 = $450.  The answer is 450. 
[EXP] 154: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 92, [output]:  First, Bill already has 2 cases of water which have 24 bottles each. 24 * 2 = 48. 48 bottles were already stocked.  Bill has 70 guests and wants 2 bottles per guest.  So he needs 2 * 70 = 140 bottles.  If he already has 48 bottles, he needs 140 - 48 = 92 more bottles.  The answer is 92. 
[EXP] 155: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 54, [output]:  Ray takes 16 minutes to swim a mile when the water is cold.  When the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long.  Twice as long as 16 minutes is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes.  2 minutes more than that is 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.  So the time it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water is 34 minutes and the time to swim a mile in cold water is 16 minutes.  To swim 3 miles in cold water, it takes Ray 16 * 3 = 48 minutes.   To swim 3 miles in warm water, it takes him 34 * 3 = 102 minutes.  The difference in time is 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.  The answer is 54. 
[EXP] 156: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  John gets paid 2 dollars per hour.  He works 5 hours a day.  So he gets paid 2 x 5 = 10 dollars per day.  He works 4 days a week.  So he gets paid 10 x 4 = 40 dollars per week.  He wants to save 80 dollars.   If he saves 40 dollars per week, he will take 2 weeks to get to his goal.  If he saves less each week, he will take longer.  The minimum it will take him to save 80 dollars is 2 weeks.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 157: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's start with the cost of the foot-long fish sub.  That's an easy one: the cost is $40. 

Next, let's figure out the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.  We know it's thrice as much as the fish sub, so we can write an equation to represent it:

Six-inch cold-cut combo = 3 x fish sub
Six-inch cold-cut combo = 3 x $40
Six-inch cold-cut combo = $120

Now we know the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo is $120.  The total cost of both subs is the sum of these two amounts:

Total cost = Foot-long fish sub + Six-inch cold-cut combo
Total cost = $40 + $120
Total cost = $160

The answer is $160. 
[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]: 7 buttons had 2 holes each.  So they had 7 * 2 = 14 holes.  The rest of the buttons (21 - 7 = 14) had 4 holes each.  So they had 14 * 4 = 56 holes.  So in total, all the buttons have 14 + 56 holes.  14 + 56 is 70.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 159: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 24 cubic inches is Timothy's locker. 24 / 2 = 12, so Zack's locker is 12 cubic inches. 12 / 4 = 3, so Peter's locker is 3 cubic inches.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 160: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many cups of coffee Octavia drinks.  She drinks half the daily recommended amount, so that's 1/2 of total cups. 

The daily recommended amount is unknown, but we can call it X.  So Octavia drinks X/2 cups of coffee. 

Juan drinks 10 times the amount Octavia drinks, so he drinks 10 times X/2 cups.  This can be simplified to 5X cups.  The doctor wants Juan to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommended amount, which is X cups.  

To find the number of cups Juan needs to reduce, subtract the daily recommended amount from the amount he currently drinks: 5X - X = 4X.  So he needs to reduce 4X cups.  The answer is 4X. 
[EXP] 161: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]: 3 cages have 10 hamsters each, so that's 3 x 10 = 30 hamsters.  The other 3 cages have 5 guinea pigs each, so that's 3 x 5 = 15 guinea pigs.  In total there are 30 hamsters and 15 guinea pigs, so 30 + 15 = 45 rodents.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 162: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Mark weighs 150 pounds.  Susan weighs 20 pounds less, so she weighs 150 - 20 = 130 pounds.  Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, so he weighs 2 x 130 = 260 pounds.   To get the average, add up the three weights and divide by 3.  150 + 130 + 260 = 540.  540 / 3 is 180.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 163: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 82, [output]:  The sun starts at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground and moves 5 degrees an hour up.  It moves for 10 hours.  So, it moves up 5 * 10 = 50 degrees.  Originally, there were 32 degrees.   After moving up 50 degrees, the angle from the ground to the sun is 32 + 50 = 82 degrees.   The answer is 82. 
[EXP] 164: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  We first need to figure out how old the younger son is because it says one of them is 12 and the other is 4 years younger. 12 - 4 = 8.  So the younger son is 8.  Since James has 2 sons, 12 and 8 years old, in total they need 12 + 8 = 20 birthday candles.   We know a pack of 5 candles costs 3 dollars.  We need to find out how many packs of candles he needs to buy.  We can do 20 / 5 = 4.  So James needs 4 packs of candles, which is 4 x 3 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 165: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 240, [output]:  First, we need to find how many minutes Judy read in both weeks.  She read for 15 minutes each night in the first week.  7 days in the week, so 7 x 15 = 105.   In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.   At a rate of 2 pages per 1. 5 minutes, that is 100 * (1. 5/2) = 75 minutes.  The total amount of time is then 105 + 75 = 180 minutes.   Each minute reads 2 pages, so 180 * 2 = 360 pages total in two weeks.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 166: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 12 sandwiches were originally. 1/3 of 12 is 4, so Cody ate 4 sandwiches. 1/4 of 12 is 3, so Trevor ate 3 sandwiches.  In total, 4 + 3 = 7 sandwiches were eaten. 12 - 7 = 5 sandwiches are left.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 167: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Shiloh is 44 years old now.  In 7 years, he will be 51.  51 is three times his nephew's age in 7 years, so his nephew's age in 7 years is 51/3 = 17.  His nephew's age now is 17 - 7 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 168: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1.  Initially, the tooth fairy left Sharon 5 dollars. 
2.   Then, the tooth fairy gave Sharon 1 dollar each for the next 3 teeth that Sharon lost.  That means 1 x 3 = 3 more dollars.  So, in total now, Sharon has 5 + 3 = 8 dollars. 
3.  Next, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for the previous three teeth for the next 2 teeth that Sharon lost.   She received 1 dollar for each of the first 3 teeth, so she received half of that amount (0. 5 dollars) for each of the next 2 teeth.  So, 0. 5 x 2 = 1 more dollar.   
As a result, in total, she receives 1 + 1 = 2 more dollars.   Now she has 8 + 2 = 10 dollars.  The total amount of money she has is 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 169: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 175, [output]:  We are told that 3 teenagers played soccer.  Richie, one of them, scored 80 goals.  We know that Richie scored 20 more goals than Mark and 45 more goals than Anna. 

Let's consider these two equations:
Mark's score = Richie's score - 20
Anna's score = Richie's score - 45

We know Richie scored 80 goals, so we can fill in the values:
Mark's score = 80 - 20 = 60
Anna's score = 80 - 45 = 35

So, Mark scored 60 goals, and Anna scored 35 goals.  Now we can add up all of their scores:
Richard's score: 80
Mark's score: 60
Anna's score: 35

Total goals = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175.  The answer is 175. 
[EXP] 170: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Liam made 63 dollars.  Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at 4 dollars each. 21 * 4 = 84 dollars.  Mitchell made 84 - 63 = 21 dollars more than Liam.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 171: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Peter started with 70 dollars.  He wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week, which is 70 ÷ 7 = 10 dollars per day. 

From Sunday through Wednesday, he bought wooden action figures for 5 dollars each.  He spent 4 days, 5 dollars each, so 4 x 5 = 20 dollars.  He has 70 - 20 = 50 dollars left. 

On Thursday and Friday, he will buy plastic action figures for 2 dollars each.  2 days, 2 dollars each, will be 2 x 2 = 4 dollars.   So he has 50 - 4 = 46 dollars left.  Let's find out how many action figures of each type he bought:

From Sunday to Wednesday, he bought wooden action figures for 5 dollars each.  He spent 20 dollars.   20 ÷ 5 = 4.  So he bought 4 wooden action figures.  This is only for Sunday to Wednesday, and he still has money left.  On the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures for 2 dollars each.  

From Thursday to Friday, he will buy plastic action figures for 2 dollars each.   He has 46 dollars left.    Let's divide 46 by 2 dollars per action figure: 46 ÷ 2 = 23.   So he will buy 23 plastic action figures. 

The total number of action figures Peter has by the end of the week is the number of wooden + the number of plastic action figures:
4 wooden action figures + 23 plastic action figures = 27 action figures.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 172: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 308, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  Spaying the kitten cost $200. 3 vaccines cost $20 each, so that is $60 total.  4 vases cost $12 each, so that is $48 total.  To find the total cost of the kitten so far, we add these costs together: $200 + $60 + $48.  $200 + $60 is $260, and $260 + $48 is $308.  The answer is $308. 
[EXP] 173: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Ford grows 40 roses each week.  For a month, he grows 40 * 4 = 160 roses.  The three flower shops buy 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses each week.   So in a month, they buy 65 * 4 = 260 roses.   Ford will lack 260 - 160 = 100 roses.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 174: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 600, [output]: 12 months in 1 year, so in 2 years she removes 2 x 12 = 24 times. 100 x 24 = 2400. 3000 - 2400 = 600.  The answer is 600. 
[EXP] 175: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 37, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step.  The food truck buys bread for $3. 00 a loaf and each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.  So, for 10 sandwiches, they will need to buy one loaf of bread, which costs $3. 00. 

The food truck spends $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments for 10 sandwiches.  So their total cost per 10 sandwiches is $3. 00 (for bread) + $30. 00 (for cheese and condiments) = $33. 00. 

They sell 10 sandwiches for $7. 00 each, which is a total of 10 x $7.  00 = $70. 00.   So, their total income is $70.  00.  

To find their net profit, we subtract their cost ($33. 00) from their income ($70.  00).  $70.   00 - $33.   00 = $37.   00.   The answer is $37. 
[EXP] 176: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  There were 3 boxes of crayons, and each box had 64 crayons, so in total Kate had 3 x 64 = 192 crayons.  Kate made crayon muffins by melting 8 crayons together, so she had 192 / 8 = 24 muffins.  She can sell these muffins for $1.  The answer is $36. 
[EXP] 177: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11232, [output]: 1.  First, let's find the number of square feet in Michael's bedroom.  He has a bedroom that is 18 feet by 12 feet.  To find the total square feet, multiply 18 by 12, which is 18 * 12 = 216 square feet. 

2.   Next, calculate the total cost of the new carpet, including padding.  Since the carpet costs $12 per square foot and the padding costs $2 per square foot, the total cost would be 12 + 2 = 14 dollars per square foot.  To find the total cost, multiply that by the number of square feet in the room: 14 * 216 = 3024 dollars.  This is the cost of the new carpet and padding.  So the cost for that is 3024 dollars.  

3.    Next, calculate the cost of removing the old carpet.  It costs $4 per square foot to remove the old carpet.  The old carpet is the same size as the new carpet, so it also measures 18 by 12 feet.  Multiply those dimensions together to get the number of square feet: 18 * 12 = 216.   Multiply that by the cost per square foot and you get the cost to remove the old carpet: 4 * 216 = 864 dollars.  

4.     Next, calculate the cost of installing the new carpet.   It costs $34 per square foot to install the new carpet.   The new carpet also measures 18 by 12 feet, so multiply those dimensions together to get the number of square feet: 18 * 12 = 216.  Multiply that by the cost per square foot to get the cost to install the new carpet: 34 * 216 = 7344 dollars.  So the cost to install the new carpet is 7344 dollars.  

5.       Finally, add up all the costs to find the total cost.   

- The cost of the new carpet and padding is 3024. 
[EXP] 178: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's find the total number of birds Mack saw in a week:

On days 1 and 2, Mack saw 50 birds. 50 birds / 2 days = 25 birds per day. 

On day 3, Mack saw 0 birds. 0 birds / 1 day = 0 birds per day. 

On days 4 and 5, Mack saw 120 birds.  120 birds / 2 days = 60 birds per day. 

On day 6, Mack saw 20 birds.  20 birds / 1 day = 20 birds per day. 

On day 7, Mack saw 90 birds. 90 birds / 1 day = 90 birds per day.  

To find the average, we add up all the birds and divide by the number of days: 

25 + 0 + 60 + 20 + 90 = 195 birds.  

There are 7 days, so we divide the total by 7: 

195 birds / 7 days = 28 birds per day.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 179: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  The problem seems complicated at first, but let's break it down step by step.  First, we know the number train started with 20.  This is given as the starting value.   Then, we take this value and add half of itself, which is 20 + (20/2) = 20 + 10 = 30.  Then, we divide this value by 5, which is 30/5 = 6.  After that, we multiply this result by the starting value minus 12, which is 20 - 12 = 8.  Then we multiply 6 by 8 to get our final answer of 48. 
[EXP] 180: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  The boy has 5 cards.  His brother has 3 fewer cards than him, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.  Together, they have 5 + 2 cards.  5 + 2 is 7.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 181: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 500, [output]:  The oven is off by 18 degrees (468 - 450 = 18).  18 is what percentage of 450? To find this, we divide 18 by 450.   18 / 450 = 0. 04 = 4%.  So the oven is off by 4%.  The recipe calls for 520 degrees.  To find the actual temperature, we take the recipe temperature, 520, and multiply it by the multiplier (1 + 4%).  
520 * (1 + 0. 04) = 520 * 1.  04 = 536.   So the actual temperature should be set to 536 degrees.  The answer is 536. 
[EXP] 182: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 215, [output]:  First, let's convert the time into minutes.  The first movie is 1 hour 30 minutes long, which is the same as 90 minutes.  The second movie is 2 hours 5 minutes long, which is 125 minutes.  Now let's add up the total minutes: 90 + 125 = 215.  The answer is 215. 
[EXP] 183: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 129200, [output]: 30% less expensive means Juan's house is worth 70% of what Herb's house is worth.  To find 70% of 76,000, multiply 0. 7 by 76,000.  This gives us 53,200.  So, Juan's house is worth 53,200.  The combined value of the two houses is 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200.  The answer is 129,200. 
[EXP] 184: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Since Judy bought a dozen cups, she had 12 cups.  She bought twice as many dishes, which means 12 x 2 = 24 dishes.  So in total, she brought 12 + 24 = 36 utensils to the charity event.  Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, so her friend brought 20 more dishes than 24.  24 + 20 = 44 dishes.  Her friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, for a total of 40 + 44 = 84.   So the total number of utensils brought by the two of them is 36 + 84 = 120.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 185: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 90 contacts will last Pete 45 days.  So each day he needs 90 / 45 = 2 contacts. 

Each box is $100. 00, and it's currently 10% off, so the discount is 10% of $100 = $10.  After discount, each box costs $100 - $10 = $90. 

Pete buys 2 boxes, so he will pay 2 x $90 = $180.  The total number of contacts is 2 boxes * 90 contacts per box = 180 contacts.  So each pair of contacts (1 contact) will cost $180 / 90 = $2.  The answer is $2. 
[EXP] 186: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Let's first find out how much Jill earned.  She worked 2 hours on Saturday and 1 hour on Sunday, so she worked 2 + 1 = 3 hours in total.   Jill earns 10 dollars an hour, so she earned 3 * 10 = 30 dollars.   Now, let's find out how much John earned.  John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so he worked 2 * 2 = 4 hours.  John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so he worked 3 * 1 = 3 hours.   In total, John worked 4 + 3 = 7 hours.  He earns 10 dollars an hour, so he earned 7 * 10 = 70 dollars.  To find out how much more John earned compared to Jill, we can subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings.  We have 70 - 30 = 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 187: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 800, [output]:  Hannah burns 500 calories per hour for 2 hours, so that's 500 * 2 = 1000 calories.  Hannah also burns 600 calories for 1 hour, so that's 600 * 1 = 600 calories.  In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories. 

For every 200 calories burned, Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water.  So, she needs 1600 / 200 = 8 times 100 ml.  That's 8 * 100 = 800 ml.  The answer is 800. 
[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's start by using a variable to represent the number of blue jelly beans.  Let's call it B.   The number of red jelly beans is B - 1% B and the number of green jelly beans is B + 1% B.   The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can set up the equation:  B + (B - 1% B) + (B + 1% B) = 4500.  Simplifying the equation, we get:  3B = 4500.  Dividing both sides by 3, we get:  B = 1500.    Now we can find the number of red jelly beans: 1500 - 1% 1500 = 1500 - 15 = 1485.    Now we find the number of green jelly beans: 1500 + 1% 1500 = 1500 + 15 = 1515.    To find the difference, we subtract 1485 from 1515: 1515 - 1485 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]: 47 is the starting point, then the speed increased to 52.  This means it went up by 52 - 47 = 5 WPM.  If it goes up another 5 WPM, then it will be 52 + 5 = 57.  To find the average of 47, 52, and 57, first add the three numbers together: 47 + 52 + 57 = 156.  Then divide the sum by 3: 156/3 = 52.   The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 190: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's break this down in stages. 

Martin is eating Cheerios, so he'll lose 1. 25 pounds each week.  After 5 weeks, he'll lose 5 x 1. 25 = 6. 25 pounds.  

Martin is eating donuts, so he'll gain 1. 75 pounds each week.  After 5 weeks, he'll gain 5 x 1. 75 = 8. 75 pounds.   

Martin gains 8.  75 pounds, but he loses 6.  25 pounds.  Therefore, at the end of 5 weeks, he'll be 8.  75 - 6.   25 = 2.   5 pounds heavier.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 191: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 319, [output]:  Alex invites 100 people initially. 100 * 2 = 200 (since each of those people will also invite 2 friends). 100 + 200 = 300.  Alex also invites 10 of her friends, so that's 10 more.  300 + 10 = 310.  Finally, 8 of her friends who attend will bring their spouses, which is 8 * 1 = 8 more. 310 + 8 = 318.  The answer is 318. 
[EXP] 192: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 220, [output]:  Let's start by figuring out the weight of the Dachshund.  If the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds, then the Dachshund weighs twice as much so it weighs 10 x 2 = 20 pounds. 

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund. 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds, so the Papillon weighs 5 pounds.  

The Mastiff weighs 44 times as much as the Papillon.  5 pounds x 44 = 220 pounds.  The Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.  The answer is 220. 
[EXP] 193: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon:
 Cost of boots = 16
 Shipping cost = 4
 Total cost on Amazon = 16 + 4 = 20

On eBay, the boots cost $13, and shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon. 4 x 2 = 8, so the shipping cost on eBay is 8.  Therefore, the total cost on eBay is:
Cost of boots = 13
Shipping cost = 8
Total cost on eBay = 13 + 8 = 21

The boots cost 21 dollars on eBay and 20 dollars on Amazon.  To find out how much more expensive they are on eBay, subtract the Amazon price from the eBay price:
21 - 20 = 1

The boots are 1 dollar more expensive on eBay.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 194: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Mark's window is 20 feet off the ground, and he planted the beanstalk 4 feet tall.  The beanstalk needs to be taller than 20 feet to reach the window.  So the beanstalk needs an increment of 20 - 4 = 16 feet. 

The beanstalk doubles its height every day.  Let's find the number of days till it reaches 16 feet.  

Day 1: 4 feet
Day 2: 4 * 2 = 8 feet
Day 3: 8 * 2 = 16 feet

The beanstalk reaches 16 feet by Day 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 195: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  Let's first find the number of cups of mushrooms John eats in a day.  Since 1 cup of mushrooms weighs 100 grams and John eats 200 grams, he eats 200 / 100 = 2 cups of mushrooms.  Since each cup has 3 grams of protein, John eats 3 * 2 = 6 grams of protein a day.  If John eats this much protein for 7 days a week, he gets 6 * 7 = 42 grams of protein per week.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 196: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.  Let's start by using a variable to represent Jerry's current age, say x.  Then, Jerry's age 5 years ago is x - 5.  Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, his current age x is also 2(x - 5).   We can set up an equation based on this information. 
  x = 2(x - 5)
Now we can solve for x.  First, we can distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation.  This gives us 
  x = 2x - 10
Now we can solve for x by adding 10 to both sides of the equation.   This gives us 
  x + 10 = 2x
Now we can subtract x from both sides to get 
  10 = x
So Jerry's current age is 10.  To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we add 3 to Jerry's current age.   
  10 + 3 = 13
The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 197: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 260, [output]:  Let's start by finding the total cost of the dental work:
	* 2 implants * $2000 = $4000
	* 1 implant crown * $500 = $500
	* Total cost = $4000 + $500 = $4500
	* Subtract the deposit: $4500 - $600 = $3900
	* George needs to pay $3900
	* His hourly wage is $15, so to find how many hours he needs to work, divide the amount needed by his wage:
	$3900 ÷ $15 = 260 hours
So, George needs to work 260 hours before he has enough to pay for the dental work.  The answer is 260. 
[EXP] 198: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  There is a triangle.  We know that all the angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  Let's call the smallest angle A.  Then the other two angles are 2A and 3A, since one is twice the smallest and one is three times the smallest.  The total of the three angles is:

A + 2A + 3A = 180

Combine like terms:

6A = 180

Divide both sides by 6:

A = 30

So the smallest angle is 30 degrees.  Then the other two angles are:

2A = 2(30) = 60

3A = 3(30) = 90

The largest angle is 90 degrees.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 199: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 69, [output]: 8 quarters are worth 8 x 25 cents = 200 cents. 6 dimes are worth 6 x 10 cents = 60 cents.  14 nickels are worth 14 x 5 cents = 70 cents.  Adding these together, Colby has 200 + 60 + 70 = 330 cents.  Colby has 15 pennies, which is worth 15 cents.  So in total, Colby has 330 + 15 = 345 cents. 

Colby wants to buy gumballs that cost a nickel each.  Since a nickel is 5 cents, we can divide the total amount Colby has in cents, 345, by 5 to find out how many gumballs he can buy.  345 ÷ 5 = 69.  The answer is 69. 
[EXP] 200: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Let's count the legs:

* Dogs: 5 dogs, each has 4 legs, so 5 x 4 = 20 legs
* Cats: 2 cats, each has 4 legs, so 2 x 4 = 8 legs
* Birds: 10 birds, each has 2 legs, so 10 x 2 = 20 legs

In total, there are 20 + 8 + 20 = 48 legs.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 201: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Jamaal originally used an 8-pound weight. 50% of 8 is 4, so he increases the weight by 8 + 4 = 12 pounds. 12 pounds is too heavy, so he uses a 12 - 2 = 10-pound weight.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 202: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 104, [output]:  Steve originally got 5 games as a gift.  Then, he bought 1 game per month for a year, so that's 1 * 12 = 12 games.  Then, he bought 2 games per month for another year, so that's 2 * 12 = 24 games.  Then, he bought 4 games per month for another year, so that's 4 * 12 = 48 games.   In total he bought 5 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 89 games.   He also got 5 games for Christmas each year, so 5 * 3 = 15 games.  Therefore, Steve has 89 + 15 = 104 games in total.  The answer is 104. 
[EXP] 203: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's first find the rate of the plane: 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.  To travel an additional 2000 miles, it would take 2000 / 400 = 5 hours.  The additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles is 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 204: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1800, [output]:  Ruiz makes 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours.  So, he makes 120 ÷ 2 = 60 pounds of chocolates per hour.  Marissa makes 3/4 of this amount per hour, so she makes 60 x 3/4 = 45 pounds of chocolates per hour.   In 12 hours, Ruiz makes 12 x 60 = 720 pounds of chocolates and Marissa makes 12 x 45 = 540 pounds of chocolates.  In total, they made 720 + 540 = 1260 pounds of chocolates.  The answer is 1260. 
[EXP] 205: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Howard had 100 dollars originally.  On Monday, he spent 8 dollars.   Then on tuesday he spent twice as much so he spent 8 x 2 = 16 dollars.  Then on wednesday he spent 4 times as much as he spent on tuesday, which is 16 x 4 = 64 dollars.  The total amount spent is 8 + 16 + 64 = 88 dollars.  The amount left is 100 - 88 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 206: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  Let's break it down:

For the first 4 hours, he sold 15 cups per hour at $0. 50 per cup.  To find the total cups sold, multiply the cups per hour by the hours: 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = 60 cups. 

To find the total amount earned, multiply the total cups sold by the price per cup: 60 cups * $0. 50/cup = $30. 

For the next 2 hours, he sold 10 cups per hour at $0. 60 per cup.  To find the total cups sold, multiply the cups per hour by the hours: 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = 20 cups.  

To find the total amount earned, multiply the total cups sold by the price per cup: 20 cups * $0. 60/cup = $12.  

To find the total amount earned for the 6 hours, add the amounts earned per period: $30 + $12 = $42.  The answer is $42. 
[EXP] 207: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Jeremy drives 400 miles a month. 400 miles is equivalent to 400 / 2 = 200 times the tires rotate (since they rotate every 2 miles).  With 725 rotations every 2 miles, that is 725 x 200 = 145,000 rotations each month.  If each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations, we need to find out how many months until it needs to be replaced.   Therefore, we can divide the total rotations per tire by the monthly rotations, which would be 10,440,000/145,000 = 72 months.  Now we can convert months to years.  There are 12 months in a year. 72 / 12 = 6.  The answer is 6 years. 
[EXP] 208: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 24 dollars cost the shampoo. 120 washings were required.  Since Jackie uses one wash per pump, we divide the number of washings by the number of pumps used (1 pump per wash). 120 / 2 pumps = 60.  So it will take 60 washings per pump.  To know the cost per pump in cents, we will start with 24 dollars and first convert it to cents.  1 dollar is 100 cents.  So 24 dollars is 24 * 100 = 2400 cents.  The original 2400 cents divided by 60 pumps will give us the cost per pump.  2400 cents / 60 = 40.  The answer is 40 cents. 
[EXP] 209: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Joe has 50 dollars initially.  The shirt is 25 dollars, and the shorts are 35 dollars.  So the total cost is 25 + 35 = 60.  There is a 30% off sale.  To find 30% of 60, multiply 0. 3 by 60, which is 18.  The discount is 18 dollars, so the new cost is 60 - 18 = 42.  

Since sales tax is included, it doesn't change the cost.  The new cost is 42.  Joe has 50 dollars and spent 42.  He has 50 - 42 = 8 dollars left.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 210: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]: 1/4 pound of butter is needed for 1 dozen croissants.  So, for 4 dozen croissants, it will take  4 x 1/4 = 1 pound of butter.  He will need to make 4 dozen croissants for 7 days.   So, he will need 1 x 7 = 7 pounds of butter.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 211: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 65,960, [output]:  Monica's street is 150 meters long, so it would cost 150 x 194 = 29,100 dollars.  Lewis' street is 490 meters long, so it would cost 490 x 194 = 94,660 dollars. 94,660 - 29,100 is 65,560 dollars.  The answer is 65,560. 
[EXP] 212: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1,450,000, [output]:  John gets 100,000 dollars for the first 5 months.  This is a total of 5 * 100,000 = 500,000 dollars.  Then his research would take 5 * 10 = 50 more months.  For each of these 50 months, he would need 50% more than the initial 100,000.  So this would be 100,000 * 1. 5 = 150,000 dollars per month.  This is a total of 50 * 150,000 = 7,500,000 dollars.  The total cost of the research  is 500,000 + 7,500,000 = 8,000,000 dollars.  The answer is 8,000,000. 
[EXP] 213: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.   The second player ate beef tips, containing 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size.   So the second player ate 8 ounces.   The third player ate a one-pound steak.   One pound is equal to 16 ounces, so the third player ate 16 ounces of meat.   Next, we add the three types of meat: 6 ounces + 8 ounces + 16 ounces.  6 + 8 + 16 is 30.  The last two players ordered vegetarian meals, so we don't need to worry about them.  The answer is 30.

[EXP] 215: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 312, [output]:  Gary does laundry twice a week.  In a year, there are 52 weeks.  So Gary does laundry 2 x 52 = 104 times a year. 

Each load of laundry uses 20 gallons of water.  In a year, Gary does 104 loads of laundry.  So he uses 104 x 20 = 2080 gallons of water. 

Each gallon of water costs 0. 15 dollars.   So Gary spends 2080 x 0. 15 = 312 dollars on water for laundry in a year. 

The answer is 312. 
[EXP] 216: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 33, [output]:  Scarlett started with $10. 00.  For the rocks, she spent 2 * 2. 50 = 5. 00 dollars.

In total, she spent 10 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 2 = 33 dollars.  The answer is 33. 
[EXP] 217: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's solve this problem step by step!

After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.  In the second week, it doubled in height, so it became 2 x 3 = 6 inches tall.  Then, in the third week, it grew another 4 inches.  To find the total height, we add the height at the end of the second week and the additional 4 inches:

6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches

So, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.  The answer is 10 inches. 
[EXP] 218: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 750kg of meat needs to be sold. 15kg of meat are sold every hour, and there are 10 hours in a day, so 15 * 10 = 150kg of meat are sold in a day.  To find out how many days it will take to sell the meat, we divide 750 by 150:

750 / 150 = 5

So, it will take 5 days for Prince to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 219: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

There are 4 rows of seats, and each row has 18 seats, so the total number of seats is:

4 rows x 18 seats/row = 72 seats

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by the administrators, so:

72 seats x 1/4 = 18 seats

The administrators occupy 18 seats. 72 - 18 = 54 seats remain.  One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by the parents, so:

54 seats x 1/3 = 18 seats

The parents occupy 18 seats. 54 - 18 = 36 seats remain.  Therefore, the students occupy:

36 seats

So, there were 36 students in the school auditorium.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 220: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 76, [output]:  Each pole has 4 street lights, and there are 6 poles at each of 4 intersections. 6 * 4 = 24 street lights for each intersection, and 24 * 4 = 96 street lights in total. 20 street lights are not working, so the number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76.  The answer is 76. 
[EXP] 221: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1509, [output]: 2 DVDs with the number of times played:

1.  The first DVD has been played 356 times. 1000 - 356 = 644 times left before breaking. 
2.   The second DVD has been played 135 times.  1000 - 135 = 865 times left before breaking. 

We add these remaining times together to find the total: 644 + 865 = 1509.  The answer is 1509. 
[EXP] 222: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3000, [output]:  John went to physical therapy for 6 weeks.  Each week, he went twice for 2 hours at a time.   So he went for a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per week.   In 6 weeks, he went for a total of 4 * 6 = 24 hours. 

The sessions cost $125 per hour.  So, the total cost will be 24 * 125 dollars. 24 * 125 = 3000.  The answer is 3000. 
[EXP] 223: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

Jim starts with 20 pieces of gum.  Jim chews 1 piece for every 2 hours he's at school, and he's at school for 8 hours.  So Jim chews 8/2 = 4 pieces of gum while he's at school.  Jim also chews 1 more piece on the way home from school, and 1 more piece after dinner.  So in total, Jim chews 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pieces of gum. 

Since Jim has 20 pieces of gum initially, he has 20 - 6 = 14 pieces of gum left after he's finished chewing.  When he gives half the gum to his sister, Jim gives 14/2 = 7 pieces of gum to his sister.  So Jim has 14 - 7 = 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 224: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Charmaine is currently uncertain, but she will be 16 years old in 12 years.  To find out how old she will be 4 years from now, we first need to find her age in 12 years.  To do this, we subtract 12 from 16 to get her current age, which is 16 - 12 = 4.   So Charmaine is 4 years old now.  Now, we need to find out how old she will be 4 years from now.   This is simply 4 + 4 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 225: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 85, [output]:  The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each, so he spent 9 x 3 = 27 dollars.  The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each, so he spent 8 x 14 = 112 dollars.  The difference in the amount spent by the coaches is 112 - 27 = 85 dollars.  The answer is 85. 
[EXP] 226: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]: 10 rows of flowers, with 20 flowers in each row, means there are 10 x 20 = 200 flowers in total.  4/5 of 200 is 160.  The answer is 160. 
[EXP] 227: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]: 1 Mb has 1000 kb.  Ashley has an internet connection speed of 20 kb per second.  We need to find how many Mb per hour. 

Let's first convert seconds to hours.  There are 60 seconds in a minute, and 60 minutes in an hour.  So there are 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.  

Now we can multiply Ashley's speed by the number of seconds in an hour to get her speed in kb per hour: 20 kb * 3600 s = 72000 kb per hour.  We know 1 Mb = 1000 kb, so we can convert kb to Mb by dividing by 1000. 72000 kb / 1000 = 72 Mb per hour.  The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 228: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 54, [output]: 10 cars per day for 3 days means a total of 10 * 3 = 30 cars. 4 fewer cars each of the remaining 4 days means a total of 10 - 4 = 6 cars per day. 6 cars per day for 4 days means a total of 6 * 4 = 24 cars. 30 + 24 = 54.  The answer is 54. 
[EXP] 229: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 feet = 4 x 12 = 48 inches (since there are 12 inches in 1 foot).  Adam's current height is 40 inches.  He will grow 2 inches a year.  To find how many years he will grow until he is tall enough, we need to find the difference between his current height and the height he needs to be. 48 - 40 = 8.   If he grows 2 inches a year, then we need to find out how many years it will take to grow 8 inches.  8 / 2 = 4.   The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 230: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17500, [output]:  First, James sold 10 cars for $25,000 each.  So he made 10 x 25000 = 250000 dollars.   The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars, so James got 250000 - (0. 3 * 250000) dollars.  This is 250000 - 75000 = 175000.   Now he got a 10% commission on the profits, so he made 10% of the profits.  This is 0. 1 * 175000 = 17500.   The answer is 17500.

Step 3: Find the number of men who can stay upright (the rest of the riders who can stay upright minus the women) = 25 - 15 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 232: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4800, [output]: 4/5 the cost of a diamond Jewell is the cost of a gold Jewell, so a gold Jewell is 2000 x 4/5 = 1600. 1600 is the cost of the gold Jewell. 400 less than the cost of gold is the cost of the silver Jewell, so the silver Jewell is 1600 - 400 = 1200. 2000 (the cost of a diamond), 1600 (the cost of a gold Jewell), 1200 (the cost of a silver Jewell). 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800.  The answer is 4800. 
[EXP] 233: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Max bought 16 snowflake stamps. 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps means he bought 16 + 3 = 19 truck stamps.  9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps means he bought 19 - 9 = 10 rose stamps. 16 snowflake stamps, 19 truck stamps, and 10 rose stamps in total is 16 + 19 + 10 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 234: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.  The distance between them is 75 miles.  Since Tom is driving 70 miles per hour and Bob is driving 55 miles per hour, the distance between them is closing at 70 - 55 = 15 miles per hour.   So it will take 75 / 15 = 5 hours for Tom to catch up with Bob.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 235: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  If Naomi caught 17 fish, and Darren caught 6 less than Naomi, then Darren caught 17 - 6 = 11 fish.  Tommy caught 3 more than Darren, so Tommy caught 11 + 3 = 14 fish.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 236: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 10 classes for 60 dollars means each class costs 60 / 10 = 6 dollars. 6 dollars per class is not more than 10 dollars, so it is less than 10 dollars.

[EXP] 239: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 4 apples cost $5. 20 so 1 apple costs $5. 20 ÷ 4. 3 oranges cost $3. 30, so 1 orange costs $3.  30 ÷ 3.  We need to find the cost of 1 apple and 1 orange.  5. 20 ÷ 4 is $1. 30 and $3.  30 ÷ 3 is $1.  10.   1 apple costs $1.   30 and 1 orange costs $1.   10, so 5 apples will cost 5 x $1.  30 = $7. 50, and 5 oranges will cost 5 x $1.   10 = $5.  00.   To find the total cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges, we add the cost of both: $7.  50 + $5.  00 = $12.   50.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 240: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 216, [output]:  Bob wants to dig a hole with dimensions of 6 feet by 4 feet by 3 feet.  To find the volume of the hole, we multiply the dimensions: 6 x 4 x 3 = 72 cubic feet.  If it takes him 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth, then to shovel the entire hole, it will take him 72 x 3 = 216 seconds.  The answer is 216. 
[EXP] 241: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 43,500, [output]:  To solve this problem, I will add up the cost of each feature and then add the base price.  The base price is $30000.  The king cab is $7500.  The seats are one-third the cost of the king cab, so one-third of $7500 is $2500.  Running boards are $500 less than that, so they are $2000.  The upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  Adding those costs up, the total extra cost is 7500 + 2500 + 2000 + 1500 = 13500.  Adding that to the base price, the total cost of the truck is 30000 + 13500 = 43500.  The answer is $43,500. 
[EXP] 242: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 262500, [output]: 5% of 20000 is 5% x 20000 = 1000.  So his new salary is 20000 + 1000 = 21000 per month.  Now, half a month's salary is 20000 ÷ 2 = 10000.  10000 is the bonus.  In total, his monthly income is 21000 + 10000 = 31000.  In a year, he makes 12 x 31000 = 372000.  The answer is 372000. 
[EXP] 243: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10,800, [output]:  James buys 10 suits for $750 each, so that is 10 x $750 = $7500.  He buys 10 dress pants for 1/5 the cost of the suits, so that is 10 x $750 ÷ 5 = 10 x $150 = $1500.  He buys 3 dress shirts for each of the 10 suits, so that is 3 x 10 = 30 dress shirts.   Each dress shirt is $60, so that is 30 x $60 = $1800.   The total cost is 7500 + 1500 + 1800, which is 10800.  The answer is $10,800.

Their son is half as old as his mom, so his age is 64/2 = 32.  Steve's son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband, so her age is 32 - 3 = 29.  The answer is 29. 
[EXP] 246: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 8 portions of 2 kilograms each means that 1 bag contains 2 x 8 = 16 kilograms of flour. 3 bags will be 16 x 3 = 48 kilograms of flour.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 247: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  Alisa biked at a rate of 12 miles per hour.  Since she biked for 4. 5 hours, she biked a total of 12 x 4. 5 = 54 miles.  Stanley biked at a rate of 10 miles per hour.  Since he biked for 2.  5 hours, he biked a total of 10 x 2.  5 = 25 miles.   Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 54 + 25 = 79 miles.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 248: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Bill can dig 4 feet/hour through soil.  There are 24 feet of soil, so it will take him 24 / 4 = 6 hours to dig through the soil.  Bill can dig half as fast through clay, or 2 feet per hour.  It will take him 8 / 2 = 4 hours to dig through the clay.  The total time it will take is 6 + 4 = 10 hours.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 249: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 54, [output]: 3 (Howie himself) + 1 (teacher) + 25 (classmates) = 29 people in total. 29 people get 2 cupcakes each, so the total number of cupcakes he should buy is 29 x 2 = 58.  The answer is 58. 
[EXP] 250: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 162000, [output]:  Fishio originally had 2000 likes. 3 weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number, which is 2000 * 70 = 140000. 140000 + the 2000 she already had is 142000.  Then she received 20000 more likes.  So, 142000 + 20000 = 162000.  The answer is 162000. 
[EXP] 251: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 142, [output]: 1st day:
Clara bought 20 pomegranates for $20 each, so that's 20 x 20 = $400.  But she got a $2 discount, so she actually paid $398. 2 days later, she bought 20 pomegranates at $30 each, but got a 10% discount on the total cost.  The total cost would be 20 * 30 = 600, then 10% off would be 600 * 0. 10 = 60.  So she paid 600 - 60 = 540.  The difference is 540 - 398 = 142.  The answer is 142. 
[EXP] 252: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1.  In the first month, Ariadne's sales from green hats were twice the amount she earned from red hats, which is $400.  So, her sales from green hats were $800 ($400 x 2). 
2.  The total amount she earned in the first month is the sum of the sales from red and green hats: $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200. 
3.  In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  To find the amount she earned in the second month, multiply the first month's total by 3/4: 
   $1200 x 3/4 = $900.  So, she earned $900 in the second month. 
4.  To find the total amount she made over the two months, add the amounts earned in each month: 
   $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100.  
   The answer is $2100. 
[EXP] 253: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 75, [output]:  James rents the carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, so he rents it for 9 - 5 = 4 hours.  He gets one hour free, so effectively he rents it for 4 hours.  The first hour costs him 15 dollars.  Each hour after that costs twice as much as the first hour, so that's 15 * 2 = 30.  So the cost for the 3 hours after the first hour is 3 x 30 = 90.   In total, James paid 15 + 90 = 105.  The answer is 105. 
[EXP] 254: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Sally started with 200 dollars.  After the week, she had 420 dollars.  420 - 200 = 220.  This means she added 220 dollars to her account.  Since her weekly wage should be 300 and she didn't receive any other money, the 300 dollars that should be in her account are actually 220 dollars.  So 300 - 220 = 80 dollars were withheld from her wage.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 255: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 16 guests will each eat 3 deviled egg halves, so in total they will eat 16 x 3 = 48 deviled egg halves. 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, so to make 48 halves, we need 48 / 2 = 24 whole eggs.  Since the question asks for dozens, we convert 24 to dozens by dividing by 12. 24 / 12 = 2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 256: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 15 pages are total. 1/3 of 15 pages is 15 * 1/3 = 5. 15 - 5 = 10 pages.  The answer is 10.

The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 258: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 330000, [output]:  James paid 150,000 for the plane.  Rent is 5000 a month and fuel is 2*5000 = 10,000 a month.   So maintenance cost per month is 5000 + 10,000 = 15,000.   For a year (12 months), the total maintenance cost would be 12 * 15,000 = 180,000.   Total cost for the first year would be 150,000 (for the plane) + 180,000 (for maintenance) = 330,000.  The answer is 330,000. 
[EXP] 259: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Finley cooked rice for 30 minutes.  It took 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice.  So it took her 30 + 20 = 50 minutes to cook the pork.  Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice.  The combined cooking time of pork and rice is 30 + 50 = 80 minutes.  Half of this is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.  So Finley spent 30 minutes cooking rice, 50 minutes cooking pork, and 40 minutes cooking beans.  In total, she spent 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 minutes cooking all the food.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 260: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost:

Total cost is 5 + 5 = 10

1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost:
1/5 * 10 = 2 for almonds
1/3 * 15 = 5 for walnuts
Total cost is 2 + 5 = 7

How much more does 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts cost than 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts?
10 - 7 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 261: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's start by saying that the number of geese can be represented by 'G' and the number of sheep can be represented by 'S'.  We can write an equation based on the information given:

 Number of heads = S + G = 20

And, the number of animal legs = 4S + 2G = 70

We know that the number of animal heads is 20, so S + G = 20.  We can solve for S by subtracting G from both sides:

 S = 20 - G

We can substitute this expression for S into the equation for the number of animal legs:

4(20-G) + 2G = 70

Expanding the equation:

80 - 4G + 2G = 70

Combine like terms:

-2G = -10

Divide both sides by -2:

G = 5

Now we can find S by substituting G into the equation S = 20-G:

S = 20-5

S = 15

We want to find the number of sheep, which is S, which is equal to 15.  There are 15 sheep on Lee's farm.  The answer is 15.

[EXP] 266: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 60% of 150 teachers are history teachers.  To find the number of history teachers, multiply 60% by 150:

60/100 x 150 = 90

So, there are 90 history teachers.  To find the number of math teachers, subtract the number of history teachers from the total:

150 - 90 = 60

So, there are 60 math teachers.  Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

60 teachers x 6 hours = 360 hours

The answer is 360 hours. 
[EXP] 267: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 1.  We know Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, who has $120.  So Kassidy has 3/4 * 120 = 90 dollars.

So, there were 12 good days and 8 bad days.   The remaining moods are of the neutral type, so the number of neutral days is 30 - 12 - 8 = 10. 

The next three days report 3 moods.  These are 1 good, 1 neutral, and 1 good.  From the 12 good days before this, 8 were already reported, so there are 12 - 8 = 4 good days left.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 274: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Since Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has, we can set up the equation:

21 = 2 x (number of books Sally has) + 3

To solve for the number of books Sally has, we can subtract 3 from both sides:

21 - 3 = 2 x (number of books Sally has)

18 = 2 x (number of books Sally has)

Next, we can divide both sides by 2:

18 / 2 = (number of books Sally has)

9 = (number of books Sally has)

So, Sally has 9 books.  The answer is 9.

[EXP] 276: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 33, [output]:  James started with 4 toys.  He has 4 dogs, and each dog needs one toy.  So 4 toys are already accounted for.  But, there are 8 more dogs that need toys, and each one needs one toy.  So James needs 8 more toys.  Now he has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.  But, now there are twice as many dogs as before, so there are 2 x 8 = 16 more dogs, and each one needs one toy.  That's 16 more toys.  So James needs 12 + 16 = 28 toys.   Then, 3 dogs were gone, and they don't need toys anymore.  So James can subtract 3 toys.  28 - 3 = 25.  James needs 25 toys in total.   The answer is 25.

[EXP] 282: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 298, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

1.  Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max.  If Katarina has 68 cookies, that means Max has 68 + 5 = 73 cookies. 
2.   Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster.   This means the Cookie Monster has 73 - 12 = 61 cookies. 
3.   Summer has 23 more cookies than Max.  This means Summer has 73 + 23 = 96 cookies. 96 + 61 + 68 is the total number of cookies they have.  So, the answer is 225. 
[EXP] 283: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  

Shania adds 50% of the original length, which means she adds half of the original length.  Let's call the original length "x".  After adding 50%, the dress becomes "x + x/2" long, which can be simplified to "3x/2".  She then adds 20cm to the bottom with a lace trim, so the final length is "3x/2 + 20".   We know this is equal to 140, so we can set up the equation:

"3x/2 + 20 = 140"

To solve for "x", we subtract 20 from both sides:

"3x/2 = 120"

Then, we multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

"3x = 240"

Finally, we divide both sides by 3:

"x = 80"

So the dress was originally 80cm long.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 284: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]: 1 hour in turtle mode is 60 minutes.  Half of his lawn took 60 minutes.  If he wanted to divide the lawn into two halves and mow each half at a different speed, the other half took 40 minutes.  Since each half of the lawn is equally sized, the total time is 60 + 40 = 100 minutes.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 285: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  John and Jack start with 30 minutes to walk to school.  It takes them 6 minutes to get to the corner where the library is, and another 13 minutes to get to the fire station.  So, they take 6 + 13 = 19 minutes.  They have 30 - 19 minutes left, which is 11 minutes.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 286: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 1 kilo of apples for $4, 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo, so 2 x 2 = 4, and 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo, so 2 x 3 = 6. 4 + 4 + 6 = 14 dollars.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 287: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Greta bakes 30 cookies.  Celinda bakes twice as many, so Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies. 30 + 60 is 90 cookies in total.  After eating 10, they have 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 288: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem.  There is one set of twins and one set of triplets, and there is a relationship between the ages of one twin and one triplet.  The problem also gives us the combined age of all the children, which is 44.  We know that the ages of all the children can be written as 2x + 3y, where x is the age of one twin and y is the age of one triplet.  The problem also gives us that x is 7 years older than y.  So we have the equation 2x + 3y = 44.  Substitute in x = y + 7, and we have 2(y + 7) + 3y = 44.   Simplify to get 5y + 14 = 44.   Subtract 14 on both sides to get 5y = 30.   Divide both sides by 5 to get y = 6.  Now we know the age of one triplet is 6.  Since x = y + 7, we know the age of one twin is 6 + 7 = 13.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 289: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 20 minutes for math, 40 minutes for reading homework, and 20 minutes for history homework, that's a total of 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes. 3 hours is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. 180 - 80 is 100 minutes. 100 is how many minutes John has left.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 290: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Manolo started with 5 lollipops that cost 5 x $0. 40 = $2.  He also bought 4 candies for $3. 20, so he spent $2 + $3.  20 = $5.  20.  Now, let's figure out the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies.  10 lollipops will cost 10 x $0. 40 = $4.  And 10 candies will cost the same as 4 candies, so that is still $3.   So, 10 lollipops and 10 candies will cost $4 + $3.  = $7.   The answer is $7. 
[EXP] 291: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5760, [output]:  Let's solve this problem step by step.  Rong is saving 20 coins per month.  Since Neil saves 2/5 more, he is saving 20 + (2/5 * 20) = 20 + 8 = 28 coins per month. 

Rong and Neil have been saving for 10 years.  There are 12 months in a year, so they have been saving for a total of 10 * 12 = 120 months. 

Rong has been saving 20 coins per month, so in total he has saved 20 * 120 = 2400 coins.  Neil has been saving 28 coins per month, so in total he has saved 28 * 120 = 3360 coins.  

Together, they have a total of 2400 + 3360 = 5760 coins.  The answer is 5760. 
[EXP] 292: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 25, [output]: 2 vaccines at 20 dollars each cost 2 x 20 = 40.  And he also got a heartworm check.  But we don't know how much the heartworm check is yet.  Since the heartworm check is 60% of his total bill, and we don't know the total bill, we can't calculate the cost of the heartworm check yet.  So we can't find out how much John left with.  The answer is unclear. 
[EXP] 293: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 1 apple costs $0. 5.  1 banana costs twice as much, so $1.  1 orange costs three times as much as a banana, so $3. 

A crate of fruit consists of 5 bananas, 12 apples and 7 oranges, worth:

5 bananas * $1 each = $5
12 apples * $0. 5 each = $6
7 oranges * $3 each = $21

Adding them up, we get 5 + 6 + 21 = $32.  The price for one crate of fruit is $32.  The answer is $32. 
[EXP] 294: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Brittany's quilted comforter has many 1-foot x 1-foot colored squares.  It has 14 red squares.  It has 4 more blue squares than red squares, so that is 14 + 4 = 18 blue squares.  It has 6 more green squares than blue squares, so that is 18 + 6 = 24 green squares.  It has 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so that is 24 - 12 = 12 white squares. 

In total, there are 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68 squares.  Each square is 1 foot by 1 foot, so it is 1 square foot each.  So, if we multiply the number of squares (68) by 1 (square foot per square), we get 68 square feet.  The answer is 68. 
[EXP] 295: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  There are 42 adults and 15 babies attending the function. 42 + 15 = 57 people total. 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs means 5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs. 40 + 8 = 48 chairs are needed in total.  57 people will need 57 chairs. 57 - 48 = 9 chairs are needed.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 296: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 50 percent of deer are bucks. 50% means half, so the number of bucks is 50 / 2 = 25.  Now, 20 percent of the bucks are 8 point bucks. 20 percent means 1/5, so it is 1/5 of 25 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 297: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 145, [output]:  Let's solve this step by step!

1.  Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.  30% of 50 is 15.  So, Betty collected 50 + 15 = 65 points. 

2.   Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom, who has 30 points less than Betty.   Therefore, Tom has 65 - 30 = 35 points.   Marta has 3 times more, so she has 3 x 35 = 105 points.  Adam has 50, Betty has 65, Marta has 105, and Tom has 35.  In total, they have 50 + 65 + 105 + 35 = 255 points.   To go on the trip, they need 400 points, so they need 400 - 255 = 145 points more.  The answer is 145. 
[EXP] 298: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

Great Grandma Jones has 3 children, and each of them has 3 children of their own (her grandchildren).  So, she has a total of 3 x 3 = 9 grandchildren.  Each of these grandchildren has 3 babies of their own (her great grandbabies).  This means there will be a total of 9 x 3 = 27 great grandbabies.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 299: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 720, [output]:  Greta has $2400. 50% of her pay goes into her retirement account.  50% is the same as 1/2, so 1/2 of $2400 is $1200.  Then, 20% of her paycheck goes to her car payment. 20% is the same as 1/5, so 1/5 of $2400 is $480.  So, the total she puts towards her retirement account and car payment is $1200 + $480 = $1680.  Greta starts with $2400 and takes out $1680, so she has $2400 - $1680 = $720 left to spend.  The answer is 720. 
[EXP] 300: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 20 pencils is the total capacity. 4 pencils are missing, so 20 - 4 = 16 pencils are left. 16 pencils can be divided into pairs. 16 / 2 = 8 pairs. 8 pairs of pencils are left.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 301: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 135, [output]: 15 boxes of 20 fireworks each equals 15 * 20 = 300 fireworks. 40% of 300 is 40/100 * 300 = 120. 120 fireworks Hannah will be able to see.  She is also setting off 3 boxes of 5 fireworks each.  That's 3 * 5 = 15 fireworks.  In total Hannah will see 120 + 15 fireworks.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 302: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]: 20 people (Aiden and his friends) are going to the cinema.  Each seat can fit one person, two drinks, and three snacks.  So, each seat requires 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 items (1 person, 2 drinks, and 3 snacks).  For 20 people, they need 20 x 6 = 120 items.  For 120 items, they will buy 120 / 2 = 60 drinks (since each costs 2 dollars) and 120 / 3 = 40 snacks (since each costs 2 dollars).  For 60 drinks, they will spend 60 x 2 = 120 dollars.  For 40 snacks, they will spend 40 x 2 = 80 dollars.  So, they spent 120 + 80 dollars on drinks and snacks.   The answer is 200. 
[EXP] 303: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2800, [output]:  Gissela can haul 4000 pounds of gravel.  If Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, Gordy's truck can haul 4000 + 800 = 4800 pounds of gravel.  The three trucks combined can haul a total of 11600 pounds of gravel.   If we add Gissela and Gordy's trucks together, it would be 4000 + 4800 = 8800 pounds of gravel.  11600 - 8800 = 2800 pounds of gravel is carried by Gary's truck.  The answer is 2800. 
[EXP] 304: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  There are 8 males and 6 females.  Each female ate 3 dumplings.  The males ate 1 more dumpling than the females, so they each ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.   There are 8 males and 6 females.  To find the total dumplings eaten, first we find the total dumplings eaten by males. 8 males ate 4 dumplings each, so they ate 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.  The females ate 6 * 3 = 18 dumplings.  Adding the total dumplings eaten by males and females, we get 32 + 18 = 50 dumplings.  Since there are no leftovers, the total dumplings cooked by Larry is equal to the total dumplings eaten.  So the answer is 50. 
[EXP] 305: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Gerald and Julia initially had 100 dollars.  
We do not know how to split 100 in the ratio 3:2.  But we can do it by giving 100 * 3/5 = 60 dollars to Gerald and 100 * 2/5 = 40 dollars to Julia.  So Gerald had 60 dollars and Julia had 40 dollars.  Now Gerald spent 10 dollars.  That left him with 60 - 10 = 50 dollars.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 306: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Marathon's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle.  Marathon's cat can run 15 feet per second, so her turtle can run 15 / 5 = 3 feet per second.  After 40 seconds, her turtle can crawl 3 * 40 = 120 feet.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 307: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 6300 dollars is the goal, but they have only raised 2100.  So they need 6300 - 2100 = 4200 more dollars.  In every hour, they raise 2100 / 3 = 700 dollars.  To reach 4200 dollars, they need 4200 / 700 = 6 more hours.  So, they have to fundraise for 3 + 6 = 9 hours in total.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 308: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 40% of the water is used by the city, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. 80% of 40% is 32%.  So the city uses 40% - 32% = 8% of the river's water for non-industrial purposes.  The answer is 8%. 
[EXP] 309: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 7 days per week, so for 1 week, Alex earns 7 * 12 dollars = 84 dollars.  For 2 weeks, she earns 2 * 84 = 168 dollars.  The answer is 168. 
[EXP] 310: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3000, [output]:  Let's break this problem down into parts.  

In 2 hours, the factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream.  This means the factory makes 100 quarts per 2 hours.  To find out how many quarts are made in 1 hour, we can divide 100 by 2, which is 50.  So the factory makes 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream per hour. 

Similarly, the factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.  We can find out how many quarts are made in 1 hour by dividing 50 by 4, which is 12. 5.   So the factory makes 12. 5 quarts of vanilla ice cream per hour.  

Now we can find out how many quarts are made in 48 hours by combining the chocolate and vanilla ice cream production rates.  

For chocolate, the production rate is 50 quarts per hour.  In 48 hours, the factory would make 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream.  For vanilla, the production rate is 12. 5 quarts per hour.   In 48 hours, the factory would make 12.  5 * 48 = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream.  The total number of quarts made would be the sum of the chocolate and vanilla production: 2400 + 600 = 3000.  The answer is 3000. 
[EXP] 311: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Marcus has 5 croissants which costs 5 x 3. 00 = 15.  He also has 4 cinnamon rolls which costs 4 x 2. 50 = 10. 00.  He also has 3 mini quiches which costs 3 x 4.  00 = 12.  00.   Finally, he also has 13 blueberry muffins which costs 13 x 1.  00 = 13.  00.  So the total cost of his purchase before discount is 15 + 10 + 12 + 13 = 50.   00.   Since he has a loyalty card that gives him 10% off his purchase, we must subtract 50 * 0. 10 = 5.   00 from 50.   00, so Marcus' final bill will be 50 - 5 = 45.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 312: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 6 dollars are available.  1 scoop of ice cream cost 1. 50 dollars, so for each 2 + 1 = 3 scoops bought, it costs 1. 50 * 2 = 3 dollars.  We can buy as many 2 + 1 sets as the 6 dollars will allow us to buy.  6 / 3 is 2.  So two 2 + 1 sets can be bought, for a total of 4 scoops.  The remaining 6 - 3 * 2 = 0 dollars are used up.  If the remaining money is 0, then we did not use it up to buy more ice cream.  So the answer is 4 scoops. 
[EXP] 313: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 2 weeks = 14 days.  Ginger eats 4 pieces a day, so after 14 days, she will have eaten 14 x 4 = 56 pieces of candy.  Amy eats 3 pieces a day, so after 14 days, she will have eaten 14 x 3 = 42 pieces of candy. 

Originally, both Ginger and Amy had 100 pieces of candy.  After 14 days, Ginger had 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy left.  Amy had 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy left.   Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 pieces of candy more than Ginger.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 314: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 576, [output]: 24 mosaic tiles per sq ft means we need to calculate how many sq ft Mr Boarden needs to cover, then multiply that by 24. 

Mr Boarden's bathroom is 36 sq ft. 2/3 of that is 24 sq ft. 36 * 2/3 = 24. 24 sq ft * 24 mosaic tiles per sq ft is 576 mosaic tiles.  The answer is 576. 
[EXP] 315: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  First, let's figure out how much it costs to pick the blueberries. 
First, it costs $20 to go picking.  Then it costs $1. 5 per pound.  For 30 pounds, it will cost 30 x $1. 5 = $45.   The total cost will be $20 + $45 = $65. 
Now, we need to figure out how much it would have cost to buy the blueberries in the store.  For 30 pounds, it would have cost 30 x $2. 5 = $75.  To find out how much he saved, we need to subtract the cost of buying in the store from the cost of picking blueberries.  $75 - $65 = $10.   The answer is $10. 
[EXP] 316: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 385000, [output]: 500 computers at the original price of $700 each would be 500 x 700 = 350,000. 10% higher means the price per computer is $700 + (10% of 700). 10% of 700 is 70, so the new price is 700 + 70 = 770. 500 computers at this new price would be 500 x 770 = 385,000.  The answer is 385,000. 
[EXP] 317: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 770, [output]:  The problem is tricky but let's solve it step by step.  There are 6 eggs. 6 * 75 = 450 calories from eggs.  There are 2 oz of cheese.  Each ounce is 120 calories. 2 * 120 = 240 calories from cheese.  There is the same amount of ham as cheese. 2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories from ham.  The total calories is 450 + 240 + 80 = 770.  The answer is 770. 
[EXP] 318: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 6 pencils costs 6 * 0. 50 = 3 dollars.  8 erasers costs 8 * 0. 25 = 2 dollars.  In total you spent 3 + 2 = 5 dollars.   You paid 10 dollars.   So you would get 10 - 5 dollars as change.  10 - 5 is 5.  The answer is 5 dollars.

[EXP] 321: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Castle bought 3 boxes of Coco Crunch and 5 boxes of Fruit Loops, so in total she bought 3 + 5 = 8 boxes of cereal this week.  Last week, she bought 4 boxes of cereal.  To find how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, subtract the number of boxes she bought last week from the number of boxes she bought this week. 8 - 4 = 4.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 322: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2450, [output]:  Helga taps both feet at 300 + 250 = 550 times per minute when her hands are at her sides.  If she does this for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes, she will have tapped both feet 3 x 550 = 1650 times when her hands were at her sides.  When her hands are raised, she taps both feet at 200 + 200 = 400 times per minute.   She does this for 2 minutes, so she taps both feet 2 x 400 = 800 times with her hands raised.  The total number of times Helga taps both feet is 1650 + 800 = 2450.  The answer is 2450. 
[EXP] 323: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 255, [output]:  Fixing the pothole will cost Ron:

* 3 buckets of asphalt at $25 each = 25 x 3 = 75 dollars
* a fine for unauthorized road maintenance = 120 dollars

Total cost for Ron to fix the pothole = 75 + 120 = 195 dollars

The damage to Ron's car is estimated to be $450.  Fixing the pothole will prevent this damage, so he will save 450 - 195 dollars.  450 - 195 is 255.  The answer is 255. 
[EXP] 324: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  The restaurant started with 170 + 23 = 193 chairs.  20 of the normal chairs were sent for repair.  So they have 170 - 20 = 150 normal chairs left.  Additionally, 13 of the baby chairs were sent for repair.  So they have 23 - 13 = 10 baby chairs left.   In total, they have 150 + 10 = 160 chairs left.  The answer is 160. 
[EXP] 325: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]: 6 friends in total, with 12 slices per pizza.  So they had a total of 6 x 12 = 72 slices.  

Bryce and two friends ate 2/3 of their pizzas.  Each friend had 2/3 x 12 = 8 slices.  So Bryce and his two friends together ate 3 x 8 = 24 slices. 

The two remaining friends ate ¾ of their pizzas.  Each of them had ¾ x 12 = 9 slices.  So they together ate 2 x 9 = 18 slices.  Together, all friends ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices.  So they had 72 - 42 = 30 slices left.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 326: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  A cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes.  A dog eats the same number of sausages in (2/3) of the time it takes the cat.  So, the dog eats 9 sausages in (2/3) * 30 minutes = 20 minutes.  To find the average time for both animals, add their times and divide by 2.  30 + 20 = 50.  50 divided by 2 is 25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 327: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.  8 feet and 4 inches is the same as 96 inches (8 x 12 + 4).  We know the length of Topher's shoe is 96 inches.  We're told that it's 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.   So, let x be the length of one of Bobby's shoes.   9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 9x.   We can make an equation: 96 = 9x + 10.   Subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 96 - 10 = 9x.    86 = 9x.  Divide both sides of the equation by 9:  86 / 9 = x.   So the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 86 / 9 inches.  The answer is 86/9. 
[EXP] 328: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 112, [output]: 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows, makes a total of 64 * 4 = 256 student car windows.  A quarter of them means Hannah smashed 1/4 * 256 = 64 student car windows. 32 teachers' cars with 2 windows each makes a total of 32 * 2 = 64 teacher car windows.   Hannah smashed 3/4ths of them, which means she smashed 3/4 * 64 = 48 teacher car windows. 

We can add the total number of windows smashed: 64 student car windows + 48 teacher car windows = 112 windows. 

The answer is 112. 
[EXP] 329: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 45 + 15 = 60 blue spools. 60 blue spools out of all 15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 spools. 60/150 = 0. 4 = 40%. 
So the answer is 40%. 
[EXP] 330: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1000, [output]: 5000 people were originally waiting to vote. 2/5 of them had voted by midday, so 2/5 x 5000 = 2000 people had voted.  That means 5000 - 2000 = 3000 people were left. 

By 16:00, 2/3 of the remaining people had voted.  2/3 x 3000 = 2000 people.  So 2000 out of the remaining 3000 people had voted by 16:00.  That means 3000 - 2000 = 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.  The answer is 1000. 
[EXP] 331: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Parker chews 4 pieces of gum a day.  Since he chews for 30 days, the total amount of gum he'll chew is 4 x 30 = 120 pieces.  Since each pack of gum has 15 pieces, the total number of packs needed is 120 ÷ 15 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 332: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 9 kids will eat 9 x 2 = 18 smores.  6 adults will eat 6 x 1 = 6 smores.  In total they need 18 + 6 = 24 smores.  Each sleeve makes 8 smores.  So they need 24 / 8 = 3 sleeves.  There are 3 sleeves in a box, so they will need 1 box of graham crackers.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 333: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 87, [output]:  Dora is 15 years old.  According to the problem, her father's age is 8 more than twice her age.  Twice Dora's age is 15 x 2 = 30.  Her father's age is 30 + 8 = 38.  Her mother is four years younger than her father, so her mother is 38 - 4 = 34.  The total combined age is Dora's age + her father's age + her mother's age, which is 15 + 38 + 34 = 87.  The answer is 87. 
[EXP] 334: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 4 people (Greg and 3 siblings) are splitting the money equally. 20 dollars divided by 4 is 20 / 4 = 5.  Each of them gets 5 dollars.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 335: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  According to the problem, Cindy has the following books:

2.  French book weighs 4 pounds.  
3.  English book weighs 3 pounds. 
4.  History book weighs 2 x 3 = 6 pounds (since it weighs twice as much as the English book). 3

So, the total weight of the books is 4 + 4 + 3 + 6 = 17 pounds.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 336: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 20% of 100 is 20. 50% more than 20 is 20 + 10 = 30. 30 votes went to B.  So 100 - 20 - 30 = 50 votes went to C.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 337: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Boris started with 100 apples.  Beck had 100 - 23 = 77 apples.  Boris gave 10 apples to Beck.  So Beck now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.   Boris still has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.  90 - 87 = 3.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 338: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 32 ounces of water is originally available. 3 giant cubes use 3 x 4 = 12 ounces. 7 medium cubes use 7 x 2 = 14 ounces. 8 small cubes use 8 x (1/2) = 4 ounces.  So in total, Peter uses 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 ounces. 32 - 30 is 2.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 339: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Clara has 20 books.  Clara has two times as many books as Steven, so Steven has 20 / 2 = 10 books.  Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.  Clara has 20 and Alice has 16, so Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 340: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 98, [output]:  First, let's find the cost of a half-gallon jar.  A gallon jar costs $5 and a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, so a half-gallon jar must cost $5 - $2 = $3.  If we need to find the cost of 16 half-gallon jars, we multiply the price of 1 half-gallon jar by 16: $3 x 16 = $48.   Now we can find the cost of 10 gallon jars.   Each gallon jar costs $5, and we need to buy 10 of them.  $5 x 10 = $50.   The total cost of 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars is the sum of the costs: $50 + $48 = $98.  The answer is $98. 
[EXP] 341: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 50 students in total, 10 like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. 10 + 5 = 15 do not like to play video games or music.  The rest like to play video games or music.  So the number that like to play video games or music is 50 - 15 = 35.  The number that like to play music is twice the number that like to play basketball, so the number liking to play music is 5 x 2 = 10.   If the number liking to play music is 10, then the number liking to play video games must be 35 - 10 = 25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 342: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Jeremy saw 12 birds originally. 1/3 of 12 is 12 / 3 = 4.  12 after losing 4 is 12 - 4 = 8.  Then, 20 more birds joined the yard, making a total of 8 + 20 = 28 birds.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 343: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]: 80 students are divided into two equal classes, so each class has 80 / 2 = 40 students. 40% of the students are girls, so 40% of 40 is 16 girls. 40 - 16 = 24 boys in each class.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 344: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  poisonous cake!

Okay, no, let's focus on the math. 

Mara started with 2 slices of cake, then she added 3 more, so she had 2 + 3 = 5 slices of cake.  She trippedled that amount, which means she multiplied it by 3, so she had 5 x 3 = 15 slices of cake.  Then she ate 2 slices, so she had 15 - 2 = 13 slices left.  While she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate, so she had 13 - 5 = 8 slices of cake left.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 345: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  There are 8 dogs, 5 cats, 3 birds, and 12 horses.  So, in total, there are 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 animals.  Melissa splits these animals evenly over 7 days.  So, she grooms 28 / 7 = 4 animals each day.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 346: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1100, [output]:  Mark bought 3 packs for $1800 each.  That is 3 * 1800 = 5400.  He gets 1 card worth 4000 and another card worth 1000.  That is 4000 + 1000 = 5000.  There are 30 more cards worth an average of 50 each.  30 * 50 is 1500.  So his total card valuation is 5000 + 1500 = 6500.  His total cost for the packs was 5400.   His profit is the total value of his cards minus his cost.  6500 - 5400 is 1100.   The answer is 1100. 
[EXP] 347: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Jake's family consists of 2 adults and 2 children. 2 adults for the first amusement park costs 2 * 26 = 52 dollars.  2 children for the first amusement park costs 2 * 12 = 24 dollars.  In total they would pay 52 + 24 = 76 dollars.  For the second amusement park, 2 adults costs 2 * 14 = 28 dollars, and 2 children costs 2 * 10 = 20 dollars.  In total, they will pay 28 + 20 = 48 dollars.  If they go to the first amusement park, they will spend 76 - 48 = 28 dollars more.  The answer is 28. 
[EXP] 348: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 350, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  The tomato vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day, so he used to pay 500 * 0. 5 = $250 a day.  Now he pays 500 * 0. 4 = $200 a day.   This is $50 a day in savings, so in a week (7 days) he saves 7 * 50 = 350.  The answer is 350.

Then Gunther added 25 bananas, so he now had 24 + 25 = 49 bananas.  After Arnold stole 12 more, Gunther had 49 - 12 = 37 bananas.  Then, Gunther added 6 more bananas, so he had 37 + 6 = 43 bananas.  The answer is 43. 
[EXP] 353: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 240, [output]: 1. 12 months per year.  The total electricity bill would be 12 * 100 = 1200 dollars. 4 roommates share the bill equally, so each roommate has to pay 1200 / 4 = 300 dollars per year.  Since a year has 12 months, each roommate's monthly share will be 300 / 12 = 25 dollars.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 354: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 128, [output]: 1 dozen is 12, so Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses, which is 8 x 12 = 96 glasses. 4 dozen plates is 4 x 12 = 48 plates. 96 - 10 = 86 glasses, and 48 - 6 = 42 plates. 86 + 42 is 128.  The answer is 128. 
[EXP] 355: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 89, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the worth of each item:
1 large sticker = 3 small buttons (or 1 large button)
1 small sticker = 1 small button
1 large button = 3 small stickers

Lorraine has 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.  She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.  90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons.  That leaves 3 small stickers. 
Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and the rest for small buttons.  50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons.   That leaves 20 large stickers.  She trades the remaining large stickers for small buttons.  40 - 20 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers for 60 small buttons.  That makes a total of 3 small stickers + 60 small buttons = 63 small buttons.  Now, let's find how many large buttons she has.  She trades 27 small stickers for large buttons, so she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.  She also trades 20 large stickers for large buttons.   So she has 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons. 
Lorraine ultimately has 63 small buttons + 29 large buttons = 92 buttons.  The answer is 92.

The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 357: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]: 33 people on the council.  The number of votes against is x, and the number of votes for is 2x. 33 = x + 2x.  33 = 3x.  Divide 33 by 3, we get that x is equal to 11. 11 votes are against, 2 * 11 = 22 votes are in favor.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 358: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 11 students need size extra-small.  Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so 11 * 2 = 22 students need size small.  Four less than the number of size small students need size medium, so 22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.  Half as many students need size large as size medium, so 18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.  Six more students need size extra-large than large, so 9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.  The total number of shirts ordered is 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75 shirts.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 359: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 133, [output]: 5% of 140 is 5/100 * 140 = 7 dollars. 140 - 7 = 133 dollars.  The discount is 7 dollars, so you will pay 133 dollars.  The answer is 133.

[EXP] 361: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]: 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win, which is 20/100 * 50 = 10 people.  So 50 - 10 = 40 people are remaining.  Of those 40 people, 60% think horse #7 will win, which is 60/100 * 40 = 24 people.   So 40 - 24 = 16 people are remaining, which means 16 people think horse #12 will win.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 362: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]: 6 Pomeranian girls is one third of the Pomeranians. 6 is the third part, and one third means the whole is 3 * 6 = 18.  So there are 18 Pomeranians.  18 Pomeranians are one third of all the puppies.  To find the total number of puppies, we need to know what number 18 is 2/3 of. 2/3 x n = 18, where n is the total number of puppies.  Solving for n, we get n = 18 * 3 / 2 = 27.  So there are 27 puppies in total.  Therefore, Jana has 27 puppies.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 363: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 85, [output]:  Jayden started with 70 dollars.  His sister gave him half of her 90 dollars, which is 45 dollars.  So Jayden has 70 + 45 = 115 dollars.  The camera costs 200 dollars, so he needs 200 - 115 = 85 dollars more.  The answer is 85. 
[EXP] 364: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 100, [output]: 250 cases in total, 1/2 of the second for the first house, and double the first for the third house.  Let's say the first house needs x cases.  The second house needs 2x, since the first house needs 1/2 of the second.  The third house needs 2x * 2 = 4x. 

We know that the three houses add up to 250 cases:

x + 2x + 4x = 250

Combine like terms:

7x = 250

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 35

So the first house needs 35 cases.  The second house needs 2x = 2(35) = 70 cases.   The third house needs 4x = 4(35) = 140 cases. 

The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 365: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Let's find out how much each person spent separately, and then add them up.  Leila buys 3 cucumbers at $2 each.  So she spent 3 x 2 = 6 dollars.  Jack buys 5 tomatoes at $1 each.   So he spent 5 x 1 = 5 dollars.  Chase buys 1 head of lettuce at $3 each.  So he spent 1 x 3 = 3 dollars.  To add them all together, we need to add 6 + 5 + 3.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 366: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 490, [output]: 45% more pears means that for every 100 bananas, George has 145 pears. 45% is 45 out of 100, so the ratio of bananas to pears is 100:145. 200 bananas will mean 200*(145/100) = 290 pears.  So George has 200 + 290 = 490 fruits in total.  The answer is 490. 
[EXP] 367: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Marissa started with 80 dollars. 20 dollars was spent on the ball, so she had 80 - 20 = 60 dollars left.  The candy bars each cost 5 dollars, so to find out how many she bought, we divide 60 by 5. 60 / 5 = 12.  The answer is 12.

If Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed, and Ezra read 300 books, then Ahmed read half of what Ezra did.  So Ahmed read 300 / 2 = 150 books.  In total, Ezra and Ahmed read 300 + 150 = 450 books.  After Ezra read 150 more, they read 450 + 150 = 600 books.  The answer is 600. 
[EXP] 370: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Tanya teaches 5 hours on Monday, earning 5 x 15 = 75 dollars.  For 4 classes, she earns an additional 4 - 3 = 1 x 5 = 5 dollars. 75 + 5 = 80 dollars.  On Wednesday, she teaches 2 hours and 2 classes, so she earns 2 x 15 = 30 dollars.  No additional amount for classes is earned since 2 classes is less than 3.  So 30 + 0 = 30 dollars.  In total, she earns 80 + 30 = 110 dollars.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 371: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 4 vanilla scents were available. 5 of each sold, so 5 * 4 = 20 vanilla scents were sold.

[EXP] 373: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's start by adding the hours Tatiana has on Saturday and Sunday: 7 + 5 = 12 hours.  She reads for 3 hours, leaving her with 12 - 3 = 9 hours for soccer, video games, and reading.  After reading for 3 hours, she has 9 - 3 = 6 hours left.  

She plays video games for 1/3 of this remaining time.  1/3 of 6 hours is 6 / 3 = 2 hours.  So she spent 2 hours playing video games, leaving her with 6 - 2 = 4 hours for soccer. 

Now, let's find the percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer: 4 hours (soccer) / 12 hours (weekend) = 4/12 = 1/3.  The answer is 33.

Then he gave 3/5 of the remaining pencils to Charlie.   3/5 of 25 is 3/5 * 25 = 15.  So Anthony gave 15 pencils to Charlie.  Now he has 25 - 15 = 10 pencils left.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 375: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Jack drives 75 mph there.  Distance = Speed * Time, so Time = Distance / Speed = 150 / 75 = 2 hours.  So it takes 2 hours for him to drive to the museum.  Then he spends 6 hours at the museum.   It takes 2 hours to drive back, so in total he is gone from home for 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 hours.  The answer is 10.

So in total, he needs 228 + 146 = 374 wheels.  He has 650 wheels. 650 - 374 = 276 wheels left.  The answer is 276. 
[EXP] 377: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 800, [output]: 20% off means 20/100, or 1/5, off. 1/5 of $1000 is $200, so you get a discount of $200. 1000 - 200 = 800. 800 is the amount you have to pay.  The answer is $800. 
[EXP] 378: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]: 1/3 of the 600 movies are in various series.  To find 1/3 of 600, we can multiply 600 by 1/3.  600 * 1/3 = 600/3 = 200.  So, 200 movies are in various series. 

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400 movies. 

40% of the remaining movies are older movies which are $5.  To find 40% of 400, we can multiply 400 by 40/100.  400 * 40/100 = 160.  

So, 160 movies are older movies.  

The cost of replacing these movies is as follows:
- 200 movies that are part of series: we don't have to pay 10 * 200 = 2000 dollars.  We can buy the series together for 6 * 200 = 1200 dollars. 
- 160 older movies: 160 * 5 = 800 dollars. 
- 240 remaining movies: 240 * 10 = 2400 dollars.  Total cost = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = 4400 dollars.  The answer is 4400. 
[EXP] 379: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Since Winston picked 6 pounds of peaches for 2 dollars per pound, he spent 6 x 2 = 12 dollars on peaches.  He picked 8 pounds of plums for 1 dollar per pound, so he spent 8 x 1 = 8 dollars on plums.  He picked 6 pounds of apricots for 3 dollars per pound, so he spent 6 x 3 = 18 dollars on apricots.   To find how much he spent on fruit in total, he spent 12 + 8 + 18 = 38 dollars.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 380: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 255, [output]:  To find the distance they drove, we need to find their speed first.  The speed they drove at was 50 mph.  However, we also need to find their hiking speed.  The problem states that it took them 1. 5 hours to hike.  It also states that they hike 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed.   Half of their driving speed is 50/2 = 25 mph.   If they hike 5 mph less, then they hike at 25 - 5 = 20 mph.  Since it took them 1.  5 hours to hike, they hiked a distance of 1.  5 * 20 = 30 miles. 

Since they drove for 6 hours in total, and 1.  5 hours was spent hiking, they drove for 6 - 1.   5 = 4.  5 hours.   During this time, they drove at 50 mph.  So they drove a distance of 50 * 4.   5 = 200 miles.  

The total distance to their vacation spot is the distance driven plus the distance hiked. 200 + 30 = 230.  The answer is 230 miles. 
[EXP] 381: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1. 10 points for every enemy: Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma.  So Ava jumps on x + 8 enemies and Emma jumps on x enemies.  So the difference in enemy points is 8 x 10 = 80. 

2.  5 points for each berry: Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma.  So Ava collects y + 3 berries and Emma collects y berries.  So the difference in berry points is 3 x 5 = 15. 

3.   30 points for every second left on the timer: Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma.  So Emma is left with t-4 seconds on the timer and Ava is left with t seconds on the timer.  The difference in timer points is (-4) x 30 = -120. 

    Now let's put all these numbers together.  The difference in the two scores is the difference in the enemy points + the difference in the berry points + the difference in the timer points.  The difference in scores is 80 + 15 - 120. 80 + 15 = 95 and 95 - 120 = -25.  The answer is -25. 
[EXP] 382: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]: 4 pizzas cost a total of 64 dollars.  If 2 of them cost 30 dollars, the remaining 2 cost 64 - 30 = 34 dollars. 34 / 2 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 383: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 54, [output]:  Chase and Rider can ride their bikes 3 times a day for 5 days, which is 3 x 5 = 15 times.  Then they ride for 2 more days, but twice the amount they do on usual days, so that's 2 x 2 x 3 = 12. 15 + 12 is 27.   The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 384: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Bob started with 3 orange fish and 4 white fish. 3 + 4 = 7.  Then he got 17 more fish from the pet shop.  So now he has 7 + 17 = 24 fish in total. 

After getting them home and adding them to the pond, he found that he now had twice as many orange fish as white fish.  So, let's say he now has x white fish and 2x orange fish.  We know that the total number of fish is 24.  We set up an equation to solve for x: 

x + 2*x = 24 

Combine like terms: 
3*x = 24 

Divide by 3: 
x = 8 

Bob now has 8 white fish.  But remember, 3 of them were already there before.   So the number of white fish Bob bought at the store is 8 - 3 = 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 385: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

2.  Andy uses his car from Monday to Friday: 10 miles * 5 days = 50 miles
3.  Andy's car's fuel efficiency is 10 MPG, so it consumes 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons of gas in a week
4.  The current gas price is $3/gallon, so andy spends: 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15
5.  The answer is $15. 
[EXP] 386: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 155, [output]: 1.  Carrie received 10 twenties, which is 10 x 20 = 200 dollars.  She also received 140 quarters.  Convert quarters to dollars: 140 quarters = 140/4 = 35 dollars.  She received a total of 200 + 35 = 235 dollars.  She spent all the quarters, which is 35 dollars.  She also spent 3/5 of the twenties, which is 3/5 * 200 = 120 dollars.  In total, she spent 35 + 120 = 155 dollars.  The answer is 155. 
[EXP] 387: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 142, [output]:  Ricardo has 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants. 5 tomato plants yield 5 x 22 = 110 tomatoes.  8 eggplant plants yield 8 x 4 = 32 eggplants.  Therefore, in total Ricardo can get 110 + 32 fruits.  The answer is 142. 
[EXP] 388: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8.  The remaining TVs are 1 - 3/8 = 5/8.  One eighth of 40 TVs is 40 / 8 = 5.  Three eighths of 40 TVs is 3 x 5 = 15.  So one fourth of 40 TVs is 40 / 4 = 10.  The total number of non-OLED TVs is 15 + 10 = 25. 40 - 25 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 389: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  The cost of a trip is 300 dollars.  The school is covering half of the cost. 300 / 2 = 150.  So the school covers 150 dollars.  The trip will cost John 300 - 150 = 150 dollars.  He already has 50 dollars.  So John is missing 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 390: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  To prevent the pipes from freezing, the temperature inside the house must stay above 32 degrees.  Since it was 45 degrees during the day, it will be 45 - 33 = 12 degrees at night.  Carson needs to add 32 - 12 = 20 degrees to the temperature to prevent the pipes from freezing.  If every log of wood heats the house up by 5 degrees, Carson will need 20 / 5 = 4 logs of wood.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 391: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 108, [output]: 90 people need to form groups.  The groups are 9 people each, so to find the number of groups, we can divide 90 by 9.  90 ÷ 9 is 10.  So there are 10 groups.  

Now, 3/5 of the groups brought back 2 seashells each.  To find the number of groups that brought back seashells, we need to find 3/5 of 10.  To find 3/5 of 10, we can multiply 10 by 3/5 and simplify.   10 * 3/5 = 6.   So 6 groups brought back seashells.   

Each of the 6 groups brought back 2 seashells.   To find the total number of seashells, we multiply 6 by 2.   6 * 2 is 12.  So, in total, 12 seashells were brought back.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 392: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 172 people were originally on the train.  At the first stop, 47 people got off, leaving 172 - 47 = 125 people.  Then 13 more people got on, so 125 + 13 = 138 people.  At the next stop, 38 people got off, so 138 - 38 = 100 people.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 393: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Damien finds 10 bottle caps a day.  For 30 days, that is 10 x 30 = 300 bottle caps.  Each bottle cap is worth $. 25, so Damien makes 300 * . 25 = 75 dollars.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 394: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  Jamie earns $20 per hour for her normal hours.  For the extra 3 hours, she earns 150% of her normal rate, which is 150% of $20 = $30.  She worked 8 hours at $20 per hour, so she earned 8 x 20 = $160.  For the extra 3 hours, she earned 3 x 30 = $90.  In total, she earned $160 + $90 = $250.  The answer is $250. 
[EXP] 395: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 12 female lions are counted, and half as many male lions.  Half of 12 is 6. 12 + 6 = 18 adult lions.  To those, add 14 lion cubs for a total of 18 + 14 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 396: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 40 * 0. 75 = 30. 50 - 30 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 397: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2880000, [output]: 200 workers were originally working at the company. 20 new workers were added each month.  After the first month, there are 200 + 20 = 220.  After the second month, there are 220 + 20 = 240.  After the third month, there are 240 + 20 = 260.  So, there are now 260 employees. 

The cost per month per employee is 4000 dollars.  So, the total amount of money paid per month is 4000 x 260 = 1040000.  After 3 months, the company paid 3 x 1040000 = 3120000 dollars.  The answer is 3120000.

They will also sing "Jingle Bells" once. 240 seconds for "Jingle Bells" and 300 seconds for "Deck the Halls" twice, gives 300 + 240 = 540 seconds altogether.  The answer is 540 seconds. 
[EXP] 399: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Billy started with a rate of $10 per hour. 2 months later, he got a $0. 50 per hour raise.  So, his new rate was $10 + $0. 50 = $10. 50.  On his 1st anniversary, he got a $1. 00 per hour raise.  His new rate is $10.  50 + $1.  00 = $11.  50.   Sally's starting rate is $0.  50 more per hour than Billy's starting rate.   Billy's starting rate is $10 per hour.   So, Sally's starting rate is $10 + $0.   50 = $10.  50.    Billy is now earning $11.   50 per hour.    Sally is earning $10.   50 per hour.    They work for 20 hours each.  Billy earns $11.  50 * 20 = $230.

[EXP] 401: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 428, [output]: 11 more than half as many means 11 + (1/2 * 278).  To calculate that, first calculate 1/2 * 278.  1/2 * 278 = 139.  Then add 11 more to that: 139 + 11 = 150.  Pierson had 278 points.  Nikita had 150 points.   In total they had 278 + 150 = 428.  The answer is 428. 
[EXP] 402: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1240, [output]:  Each child plants 1 tree.  There are 40 classes with an average of 25 students, so there are 40 x 25 = 1000 students.  The students will plant 1000 trees.  Each teacher plants 2 trees.  There are 40 classes with an average of 3 teachers per class, so there are 40 x 3 = 120 teachers.  The teachers will plant 120 x 2 = 240 trees.   In total, they will plant 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.  The answer is 1240. 
[EXP] 403: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  First, Bubbles has 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals in total. 

Bubbles wants to buy enough stuffed goats such that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals. 30% is the same as 30/100 or 3/10.  So, 3/10 of her stuffed animals should be stuffed goats.  Let x be the number of stuffed goats she buys.  Then the number of stuffed animals after buying goats will be 14 + x.  The proportion of stuffed goats will then be:

x/(14 + x) = 3/10

To find the number of stuffed goats Bubbles should buy, we need to solve for x:

x = (3/10) * (14 + x)

 Multiply both sides by 10:

10x = 42 + 3x

Subtract 3x from both sides:

7x = 42

Divide both sides by 7:

x = 6

So, Bubbles should buy 6 stuffed goats.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 404: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 14 days with half an hour each is 14 * 0. 5 = 7 hours. 1 week with 2 hours each is 7 * 2 = 14 hours. 7 + 14 is 21.  So Kris played 21 hours so far.  She needs to reach 30 hours. 30 - 21 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 405: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

After 2 hours, the first car will have traveled 2 x 60 = 120 miles. 

During that same time, the second car will have traveled 2 x 70 = 140 miles.  So the distance between them will be 140 - 120 = 20 miles.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 406: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1170, [output]:  James started with a cost of 600 (diamond) + 300 (gold) = 900.  To find the 30% premium, we can calculate 900 * 0. 3 = 270.  Then add the premium to the total cost: 900 + 270 = 1170.  The answer is 1170. 
[EXP] 407: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 70, [output]: 340 out of 500 third-graders passed, so 500 - 340 = 160 did not pass. 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed, so 100 - 40 = 60 did not pass.  Since the 400 fifth graders had a pass rate twice that of the fourth graders, the number of fifth-graders who passed is 2 * 40 = 80.  So the total number who did not pass are 160 + 60 = 220 and the total number who passed are 340 + 40 + 80 = 460.  To find the overall pass rate, divide the number of students who passed by the total number of students.  To find the total number of students, add the number of third-graders, fourth-graders, and fifth-graders.  500 + 100 + 400 = 1000.  So the overall pass rate is 460 ÷ 1000 = 46%.  The answer is 46%. 
[EXP] 408: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 1 bag has 72 chips.  Milo has 2 bags, so 2 * 72 = 144 chips.  Since it takes 12 chips to make 1 square inch, we can divide the total number of chips by 12 to find the number of square inches of mosaic he can make. 

144 / 12 = 12

Milo can make 12 square inches of mosaic.  Since his mosaic is three inches tall, he can make a mosaic that is 12 / 3 = 4 inches long.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 409: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 16 students drank 2 quarts each, so that is 16 * 2 = 32 quarts of tea. 4 students drank 1. 5 quarts each, so that is 4 * 1. 5 = 6 quarts of tea.  In total, 32 + 6 = 38 quarts of tea were drunk.  There are 10 quarts of tea left, so before the party, there must have been 10 + 38 = 48 quarts of tea.  Quarts is a unit of volume, and 1 quart is equal to 1/4 gallon.  So 48 quarts is equal to 48 / 4 = 12 gallons of tea.   The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 410: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Dale started with 100 candies.  Then he sold 150.  So he already sold 150, and still has 100 original candies.  Then he ordered 100 more.  So in total, he now has 100 + 100 = 200 candies. 

He's already sold 150 candies. 200 - 150 is 50.  So he has 50 candies left that he still needs to sell.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 411: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 310, [output]: 10 students are on campus at the beginning of the year.  Since the number doubles every month, at the end of the first month, there will be 20 students.  At the end of the second month, 40 students.  At the end of the third month, 80 students.  At the end of the fourth month (April), 160 students.  And at the end of the fifth month (May), 320 students.  We need to find the difference between 320 and 10, which are the students already on campus at the beginning of the year.   320 - 10 is 310.  The answer is 310. 
[EXP] 412: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 105 dollars were made in a week.  Since there are 7 days in a week, the average per day would be 105/7 = 15 dollars.  He charges 25 cents (0. 25) per branch.  So the number of branches he climbed on average per day is 15 / 0. 25 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 413: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the total number of petals before the wind blows some away.  There were 3 flowers with 5 petals each. 3 x 5 = 15 petals.  Then there were 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  4 x 6 = 24 petals.  Then there were 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  5 x 4 = 20 petals.  Lastly, there were 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  6 x 7 = 42 petals.  In total, there were 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 petals.   Rose drops one of each type of flower, so she loses 1 x 5 = 5 petals, 1 x 6 = 6 petals, 1 x 4 = 4 petals, and 1 x 7 = 7 petals.   In total, she loses 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 petals.  So the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase is 101 - 22 = 79 petals.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 414: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

Initially, there are 35 marshmallows in the bag. 

John makes 9 S'mores, which requires 9 marshmallows.  DeSean makes 9 S'mores, which requires 9 more marshmallows.  In total, 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows are used for S'mores. 

Additionally, they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. 

So, the total number of marshmallows used or wasted is 18 + 3 = 21.  Subtracting this from the initial 35, there are 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows left in the bag.  Each S'more requires 1 marshmallow, so John and DeSean can make 14 S'mores with the marshmallows left.   To find out how many each can have, divide 14 by 2 (since we are splitting the S'mores between John and DeSean):

14 / 2 = 7

So, each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 415: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]: 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.  Jack and his friends play together for 240 minutes.  Jack plays for 20 minutes per quarter.  His two friends, who play for half as long, use 10 minutes per quarter each, and his one friend, who plays 1. 5 times as long, uses 30 minutes per quarter.   So the total number of minutes each one plays can be represented by the equation 1*20 + 2*10 + 1*30 = 60.   Since 60 minutes uses 1 quarter, the total number of quarters is 240 / 60 = 4.   The answer is 4 quarters. 
[EXP] 416: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that the total is 10 ounces.  We know that the quantities of oil, salt, sugar, citrus zest, and fragrance are all part of the 10 ounces. 

Let salt = s, fragrance = f, citrus zest = z, and oil = o.   We know that salt and sugar are the same, and salt is twice as much as citrus zest.   This means that s = 2z.   We also know that fragrance is the same as citrus zest, so f = z. 

We are also told that oil is twice as much as salt, so o = 2s.  Now, we can add up all the ounces and set it equal to 10:

s + z + z + (2s) + 2z = 10

We know that s = 2z, so we can substitute this into the original equation:

2z + z + z + (2 * 2z) + 2z = 10

Combine like terms:

6z + 4z = 10

10z = 10

z = 1

Now that we know z, we can find s by substituting z into s = 2z:

s = 2z = 2 * 1 = 2

o = 2s = 2 * 2 = 4

The answer is 4 ounces of oil. 
[EXP] 417: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4500, [output]: 3 goats for 500 dollars each is 3 * 500 = 1500. 2 cows for 1500 dollars each is 2 * 1500 = 3000. 1500 + 3000 is 4500.  The answer is 4500. 
[EXP] 418: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 8 + 40 = 48. 63 - 48 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 419: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  First, we find out how many cars Joe has initially.  It is given that Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.  Joe has twice as many cars as Robert who has 20 cars.  So Joe has 2*20 = 40.  Joe sells 20% of his cars.  20% of 40 is 40 x (20/100) = 40 x (1/5) = 8.  So he sells 8 cars.   After selling, Joe remains with 40 - 8 = 32 cars.  Then he gives his mother twice as many cars as the number he sold, so that is 8 * 2 = 16 cars.  After giving away these cars, Joe remains with 32 - 16 = 16 cars.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 420: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 6,250, [output]: 175000 - 50000 = 125000. 125000 is the amount of money the students raised.  There are 20 students, so to find out how much each raised, we can divide 125000 by 20. 125000/20 = 6250.  The answer is 6250. 
[EXP] 421: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 720, [output]:  Sandy walked for 8 hours on the first day.  She walked half as many hours on the second day, so she walked 8 / 2 = 4 hours on the second day. 8 hours on the first day and 4 hours on the second day make a total of 8 + 4 = 12 hours.  There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 12 hours make 12 * 60 = 720 minutes.  The answer is 720. 
[EXP] 422: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  Hunter started with 50 cars.  After 20 more cars arrived during the first break, he counted 50 + 20 = 70 cars.  1/2 of 70 cars left during the lunch break.  We can find 1/2 of 70 by dividing 70 by 2, which is 35.  So 35 cars left during the lunch break, and Hunter counted them.  The answer is 35. 
[EXP] 423: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1260, [output]: 5 tasks per cycle * $1. 20 per task = $6.  30 cycles a day * $6 per cycle = $180 per day.  $180 per day * 7 days = $1260.  The answer is $1260.

1.  In the first game, Sasha scored 14 points. 
2.   Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.  So Julie scored 14 - 4 = 10 points. 
3.   In the second game, Sasha's score is 6 points less than Julie's score in the first game.  Since Julie scored 10 in the first game, Sasha scored 10 - 6 = 4 in the second game.  (Note that it says the second game was at Julie's home court, but it doesn't affect the calculation. )
4.  To find the total points Sasha scored, add the points she scored in each game: 14 + 4 = 18.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 425: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Kimberly bought 8 packages of cat food, and each package contained 11 tins, so she bought 8 x 11 = 88 tins of cat food.  Kimberly bought 6 packages of dog food, and each package contained 6 tins, so she bought 6 x 6 = 36 tins of dog food.  To find the difference between the number of cat food tins and dog food tins, subtract 36 from 88: 88 - 36 = 52.  Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.  The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 426: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 153, [output]:  Let p be the number of cards PJ has.  Since Smendrick has 3 times the amount of PJ, Smendrick has 3p cards.   Since Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, Becca has 3p + 12 cards.   The total number of cards is 341, so we can set up the equation:
3p + (3p + 12) + p = 341
Simplifying the equation and combining like terms gives:
7p + 12 = 341
Subtracting 12 from both sides gives:
7p = 329
Dividing both sides by 7 gives:
p = 47
PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.  The answer is 153. 
[EXP] 427: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  Cindy started with 5 green eggs.  She had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs, which means she had 5 * 2 = 10 blue eggs.  She had one fewer pink egg than blue eggs, so she had 10 - 1 = 9 pink eggs.  And she had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs, which means she had 9 / 3 = 3 yellow eggs.   To find the total number of eggs, we add 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27.  The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 428: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]:  To find the cost of shipping, we multiply the weight of the book (4 pounds) by the cost per pound (0. 35).  4 x 0. 35 = 1. 4 dollars.   Then we multiply the distance by the cost per mile (0.  08).   20 x 0.  08 = 1.  6 dollars.  So the total shipping cost is 1.   4 + 1.   6 = 2.  10 dollars.   Now we take the cost of the book and multiply it by what amazon will refund, which is 0.  75 or 75%.   32 x 0.   75 = 24.   So they will refund 24, but the book was 32, so she will lose 8.  And then we add the shipping cost, so the total amount she will lose is 8 + 2.   10 = 10.   10.   The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 429: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Mulan started with 40 dollars.  She received an additional 100 dollars from her father, making 40 + 100 = 140.  Then she bought two pairs of jeans at 30 dollars each and a bag for 20.  So she spent 2 x 30 = 60 dollars on jeans and 20 dollars on the bag, making a total of 60 + 20 = 80 dollars spent.  
To find out how much money she has left, subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:
140 - 80 = 60

So, Mulan has 60 dollars left.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 430: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14,000, [output]:  Boris started with 8,000 bars the first week.  The second week, he produces half as much, so 8,000 / 2 = 4,000 bars.  For the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week, so 8,000 * 3 = 24,000 bars.  In total, he produces 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 bars for the first three weeks.  The total he produces each month is 50,000 bars, so for the fourth week, he produces 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.  The answer is 14,000. 
[EXP] 431: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1128, [output]: 18 4-minute videos each week means 4 * 18 = 72 minutes of video recording a week. 2 hours a week is 120 minutes. 15 minutes 6 days a week is 6 * 15 = 90 minutes a week. 72 + 120 + 90 = 282 minutes a week.  There are 4 weeks, so that is 282 * 4 = 1128 minutes a month.  The answer is 1128. 
[EXP] 432: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 324, [output]:  The cost of the standard installation package is $129. 00.  Angela needs to hang some additional items on top of what is included in the standard package.  First, let's count the additional items:
- 6 - 4 = 2 more mirrors, so that is 2 x $15. 00 = $30. 00. 
- 2 - 1 = 1 more chandelier, so that is 1 x $15.  00 = $15. 00. 
- 20 - 10 = 10 more pictures, so that is 10 x $15.  00 = $150.   00. 
The total additional cost is $30.   00 + $15.   00 + $150.   00 = $195.  00.  So the total cost for Angela will be the standard cost of the package plus the additional items: $129.   00 + $195.   00 = $324.   00.  The answer is $324. 
[EXP] 433: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  Let's start by finding how much money Anthony has.  Since Eva has $20. 00 and Anthony has $10. 00 more than her, Anthony must have $20. 00 + $10. 00 = $30.  00.  Since Roy has 40% more money saved than Anthony, we can multiply Anthony's amount by 1. 4 (100% + 40%) to get Roy's amount: $30. 00 x 1.  4 = $42.  00.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 434: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]:  We can start with Pompei, who can lift a mountain 1 inch.  Saskay can lift 12 times higher than Pompei, so Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches.  Kagiyami can lift 4 times higher than Saskay, so Kagiyami can lift a mountain 12 x 4 = 48 inches.  Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami, so Naruto can lift a mountain 48 x 10 = 480 inches. 
Now we need to convert inches to feet.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so we can divide 480 inches by 12 to get 40 feet.  Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 435: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 80, [output]:  Mason's starting speed is 8 miles per hour.  He rides for 4 hours, which makes it 8 * 4 = 32 miles.  Then, after a rest, he rides for 6 more hours, which is another 8 * 6 = 48 miles.  32 + 48 is 80 miles.  The answer is 80. 
[EXP] 436: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 48, [output]: 4 turtles traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo will take twice as long to travel across the highway.  Since kangaroos took 18 hours, the turtles will take 2 * 18 = 36 hours to do the same. 

The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 437: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 140, [output]:  Let's start with Kora, who made 20 dishes.  Since Rory makes 20 more dishes than Kora, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.  Jada makes twice as many as Rory, so Jada made 40 x 2 = 80 dishes. 

Now, let's add up the number of dishes they all made: 20 (Kora) + 40 (Rory) + 80 (Jada) = 140.  The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 438: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Let's first find out how much Erika needs to pay for the laptop.  The laptop costs 600 dollars, but it would be reduced by 200 dollars after trading in her old laptop.  So she needs to pay 600 - 200 = 400 dollars. 

She already has some savings in her purse and got paid 150 dollars.  She also got an additional 80 dollars from her mom.  So, in total, she has 150 + 80 = 230 dollars.  and then she needs 50 more dollars so she will have 230 + 50 = 280 dollars in her purse.  The answer is 280.

[EXP] 440: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 5 liters are extracted from each cow. 5 * 3 = 15 liters are extracted from 3 cows currently. 25 - 15 = 10 liters are needed more to reach the daily target. 10 liters of additional milk are still needed. 10 liters / 5 liters per cow = 2 more cows are needed. 3 + 2 = 5. 5 cows are needed to produce 25 liters of milk a day.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 441: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's calculate the remaining length of each glue stick:
1. 1/6 of the stick is left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6, and the remaining length is 12 * 1/6 = 2 mm. 2.  2/3 of the stick is left, so the used portion is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3, and the remaining length is 12 * 2/3 = 8 mm. 3.  1/2 of the stick is left, so the used portion is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2, and the remaining length is 12 * 1/2 = 6 mm. 

The total length of the glue sticks that are not used is the sum of the remaining lengths: 2 + 8 + 6 = 16 mm.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 442: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5600, [output]:  Gabriel started with 5000 dollars from working on weekends and received 200 dollars from his brother, so he had a total of 5000 + 200 = 5200 dollars.  He wants a car for 10000 dollars and a phone for 800 dollars, so he will spend a total of 10000 + 800 = 10800 dollars.  To find out how much more he needs, we do 10800 - 5200 = 5600.  The answer is 5600.

[EXP] 444: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Craig started with 2 twenty dollar bills. 2 x 20 dollars = 40 dollars.  If he buys 6 squirt guns for 2 dollars each, that will cost him 6 x 2 = 12 dollars.  If he buys 3 packs of water balloons for 3 dollars each, that will cost him 3 x 3 = 9 dollars.  In total, he spent 12 + 9 = 21 dollars.  So, he has 40 - 21 = 19 dollars left.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 445: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:

1.  Jack collected 60 dishes.  Let's denote the number of socks Jack has as S.  Then, according to the problem, Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks, so he collected 2S dishes.  Equating this to 60, we get:
2S = 60
2.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get S = 30.   So Jack has 30 socks.  According to the problem, Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, so we have:
Peter's socks = 2S
= 2(30)
= 60
3.   Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.   Jack has 60 dishes, so Peter has:
Peter's dishes = 60/2
= 30
4.  To summarize, Jack has 30 socks and 60 dishes, so Jack has a total of:
Jack's socks and dishes = 30 + 60
= 90
Peter has 60 socks and 30 dishes, so Peter has a total of:
Peter's socks and dishes = 60 + 30
= 90
5.  The total number of socks and dishes they have together is now:
Socks and dishes = Jack's socks and dishes + Peter's socks and dishes
= 90 + 90
= 180
The answer is 180.

[EXP] 449: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  A clothing store has 40 white shirts and 50 floral shirts.  Half of the white shirts have collars, so that is 40 / 2 = 20 white shirts with collars. 40 - 20 = 20 white shirts with no collars. 20 of the floral shirts have buttons, so 50 - 20 = 30 floral shirts with no buttons.   The number of floral shirts with no buttons minus the number of white shirts with no collars is 30 - 20 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 450: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 900 eggs are originally. 30 eggs fit in a tray.  To find how many trays, we divide 900 by 30. 900 / 30 = 30.  So the farmer will have 30 trays.  At $2. 5 per tray, the total amount the farmer will earn is 30 * 2. 5 = 75.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 451: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  Mr.  Smith had 55 goats in Farm X and 45 goats in Farm Y.  That makes a total of 55 + 45 = 100 goats.  He sold 10 goats from Farm X and 2 x 10 = 20 goats from Farm Y.  The total number of goats sold is 10 + 20 = 30.  If he had 100 goats and sold 30, then he has 100 - 30 = 70 goats left.  The answer is 70. 
[EXP] 452: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Let's first find the total number of pairs of shoes James buys in a year. 2 pairs per month times 12 months is 2 * 12 = 24.  So James buys 24 pairs of shoes in a year.  We know he spends $2640 in a year, so we can divide that by the number of pairs to find the average cost.  $2640 ÷ 24 = $110.  The answer is $110. 
[EXP] 453: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 123, [output]: 3 baskets of green food will cost 3 * 25 = 75 dollars.  3 baskets of red food will cost 3 * 18 = 54 dollars.  But you get 2 dollars off for each basket of red food, so you get 2 * 3 = 6 dollars off.  So the cost of the red food is 54 - 6 = 48 dollars.  The total cost in dollars is 75 + 48 = 123.  The answer is 123. 
[EXP] 454: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  There are 90 rooms initially. 1/2 of the rooms is 90 / 2 = 45 rooms. 45 rooms take 20 minutes each to clean, so in total they take 45 x 20 = 900 minutes to clean. 900 minutes is equivalent to 900 / 60 = 15 hours.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 455: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

In the first year, they will build 12 homes. 12 is the initial number of homes. 

In the next year, they will build three times as many homes.  Three times 12 is 12 * 3 = 36.  So they will build 36 homes in the second year.  

The total number of homes built so far is 12 + 36 = 48. 

In the third year, they will double the number of homes built.  Double 48 is 2 * 48 = 96.  So they will have 96 homes by the end of the third year.  

The total number of homes built over the next three years is 12 + 36 + 96 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 456: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that I am 3 years younger than my brother.  Let's call my brother's age "x".   Then my age is x - 3. 

We are also given that I am 2 years older than my sister.   Let's call my sister's age "y".   So my age (x - 3) is 2 years older than my sister, which means that y = x - 5.  So y = x - 5.  

We are also given that my mom's age is one less than three times my brother's age.   So my mom's age is 3x - 1. 

Now we are given that when you add all our ages, you get 87.  

We have x + (x - 3) + (x - 5) + (3x - 1) = 87.  

Combine like terms:

5x - 9 = 87

Add 9 to both sides:

5x = 96

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 19. 2

So my brother's age is 19.  My age (x - 3) is 16.  My sister's age (x - 5) is 14.  My mom's age is 3x - 1 = 3 * 19 - 1 = 56. 

So the answer is 16.

[EXP] 459: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3430, [output]: 10 people are infected initially.  Each infected person infects 6 others, so on the first day, there are 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. 10 + 60 = 70 people infected.  On the second day, each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others, so there are 70 * 6 = 420 new infections.  70 + 420 = 490 people infected.  On the third day, each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others, so there are 490 * 6 = 2940 new infections.  490 + 2940 = 3430 people infected.  The answer is 3430. 
[EXP] 460: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1520, [output]: 40 customers gave Rafaela 20 dollars each. 40 x 20 = 800 dollars. 10% of 800 is 80, so Julieta received 800 - 80 = 720 dollars. 800 + 720 = 1520.  The answer is 1520. 
[EXP] 461: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Jennifer started with 12 oranges. 3 daughters got 2 oranges each, so that is 3 x 2 = 6 oranges. 1 boy got 3 oranges. 6 + 3 = 9 oranges gone. 12 - 9 = 3 oranges remained.  The answer is 3.

[EXP] 466: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]: 12 red cars. 
2 fewer green cars than red cars means they have 12 - 2 = 10 green cars. 
3 times the number of blue cars as green cars means they have 3 x 10 = 30 blue cars.  Red cars + green cars + blue cars = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52. 75 total cars, so 75 - 52 = 23 yellow cars.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 467: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 28, [output]:  Let's start by letting Fawn's number of books be x.  We know Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so Anne has x - 12 books.  Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so Sofie has x - 12 + 25 = x + 13 books.   Since the total number of books is 85, the sum of the three numbers must be 85.   So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 12) + (x + 13) = 85

Combine like terms on the left side:

3x - 12 + 13 = 85

Combine the constants:

3x + 1 = 85

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3x = 84

Divide both sides by 3:

x = 28

So Fawn has 28 books.  The answer is 28.

[EXP] 471: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 400 dollars is spent by both Madeline and Keenan together. 60% of 400 is 60/100 x 400 = 240. 400 - 240 is 160, which is how much Keenan spends. 160/4 is 40.  The answer is 40. 
[EXP] 472: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]:  Tobias had 60 pizza pieces originally.  On the first day, he ate 2/5 of the pieces. 2/5 of 60 is (2/5) x 60 = 24.  So after the first day, he has 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.  On the second day, he ate 10 pieces, so now he has 36 - 10 = 26 pieces left.  Then he ate 7/13 of the remaining pieces.  The remaining pieces is 26. 7/13 of 26 is (7/13) x 26 = 14.   So he ate 14 pieces on the third day.  In total, he has eaten 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.  The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 473: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]: 7 bottles of soda cost $21, so 1 bottle of soda costs $21/7 = $3.  3 bottles of soda will cost 3 x $3 = $9. 4 bottles of water cost $8, so 1 bottle of water costs $8/4 = $2.  2 bottles of water will cost 2 x $2 = $4.   Total cost will be $9 + $4 = $13.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 474: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  David has 12. 48 dollars.  Each bolt costs 0. 03 dollars.  To find the total cost of the 16 bolts, I multiply 0. 03 by 16.  0.  03 * 16 = 0.  48.   So the total cost is 0.  48 dollars.   To find out how much money David has left, I subtract the total cost from his original amount.  12.   48 - 0.   48 = 12.   Since David only spent 0.  48, he will still have all the dollars and cents from that amount.  So, he has 12.   48.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 475: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 132, [output]: 33 dollars is what Ella earned from walking dogs for 3 hours.  So the rate at which she earns money is 33/3 = 11 dollars per hour.

[EXP] 476: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Paul started with 52 marbles.  His friend gave him 28 more, so he had 52 + 28 = 80 marbles.  Then, he lost 1/4 of his marbles.   1/4 of 80 is 20, so he lost 20 marbles. 80 - 20 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 477: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 41, [output]:  First, let's figure out how many questions Amy got right for each type of question.  For multiple-choice questions, she got 80% right.  Since there are 10 questions, she got 10 x 0. 8 = 8 right.  For true/false questions, she got 90% right.  Since there are 20 questions, she got 20 x 0. 9 = 18 right.  For long-answer questions, she got 60% right. 
[EXP] 478: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7000, [output]: 3/5 of 300 chickens is equal to (3*300)/5, which is 180 chickens. 180 chickens multiplied by 50 dollars per chicken is 180 * 50 = 9,000. 9,000 is the money made by selling 180 chickens. 9,000 - 2,000 is 7,000. 7,000 is the money earned before selling the chickens.  In other words, that is the original price Isaias paid for the 180 chickens.  The answer is 7,000. 
[EXP] 479: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 32 glasses were sold in total.  Julie sold 14 glasses.  Since the boys sold an equal number of glasses, that is 32 - 14 = 18 glasses.   Since Micah and Mitchell sold the same number of glasses, that means each of them sold 18/2 = 9 glasses.  Julie sold 14 glasses and Micah sold 9 glasses.  So Julie sold 14 - 9 = 5 more glasses than Micah.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 480: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 575, [output]: 400 dollars was spent on hair.  1/4 as much as this was spent on manicure.  400 x 1/4 = 100 dollars was spent on manicure.   3/4 as much as manicure was spent on pedicure.   3/4 x 100 = 75 dollars was spent on pedicure.  Total spent at the spa is 400 + 100 + 75 dollars. 400 + 100 + 75 is 575.  The answer is 575. 
[EXP] 481: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Sarah has a rope that is 20 meters long.  Her friend wants to buy the rope for 2 dollars per meter.  So the rope's price is 20 * 2 = 40 dollars.  She sells the rope for that amount. 

Sarah will use the profit to buy a new rope, which costs 1. 5 dollars per meter.   But the new rope's length isn't mentioned.   Let's assume it's x meters long.   So the cost of the new rope will be 1. 5x.  

Sarah's profit is what she makes from the sale - what she spends on the new rope.  So we need to find the profit first.  She sells the original rope for 40 dollars, so she makes 40 dollars.   Then she spends 1.  5x on the new rope.   So the profit is 40 - 1.  5x. 

We know that the profit is what she will use to buy the new rope.  Sarah wants to know how much money she will have left over.    She will have the profit left over because she's using it for the new rope.  So, the amount left over is also the profit.   

So, we set up an equation to solve for x, the length of the new rope: 40 - 1.  5x = what's left over.  We want to know how much she has left over, so that's the answer. 
[EXP] 482: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's break it down:
Melanie's current age is not given, but we're told she'll be 18 in 10 years.  To find her current age, subtract 10 from 18: 18 - 10 = 8.   So, Melanie is currently 8 years old. 

Melanie's age will be thrice her present age when she is 3 * 8 = 24 years old.  To find the number of years from now, subtract her current age from her future age: 24 - 8 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 483: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Kelly spends money on bacon, chicken, strawberries, and apples. 

Number of packs of bacon: 5
Cost of packs of bacon: $10
Cost of 1 pack of bacon: $10 ÷ 5 = $2

Number of packets of chicken: 6
Cost of packet of chicken: twice the cost of pack of bacon: 2 * $2 = $4
Total cost of chicken: 6 * $4 = $24

Number of packs of strawberries: 3
Cost of pack of strawberries: $4
Total cost of strawberries: 3 * $4 = $12

Number of packs of apples: 7
Cost of pack of apples: half the price of a pack of strawberries: ½ * $4 = $2
Total cost of apples: 7 * $2 = $14

Total cost of all items: $10 + $24 + $12 + $14 = $60

Kelly has $65 in her budget.  She has spent $60.  To find out how much money she has left, we need to subtract $60 from $65. 

$65 - $60 = $5

So, Kelly has 5 dollars left in her budget.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 484: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step! Elaina's usual concert runs for some unknown number of minutes, let's call it x.  To make the final concert twice as long, she makes it 2x minutes long.  Then, the final concert runtime is 65 minutes.   So, 2x + 15 = 65.  To solve for x, we need to subtract 15 from both sides of the equation, then divide both sides by 2.  2x + 15 - 15 = 65 - 15.  This simplifies to 2x = 50.  Then, 2x / 2 = 50 / 2.  This simplifies to x = 25.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 485: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Argo started with 200 toys.  After giving 40 toys to Alyssa, he had 200 - 40 = 160 toys left.  After giving 80 toys to Bonnie, he had 160 - 80 = 80 toys left.  After giving 30 toys to Nicky, he had 80 - 30 = 50 toys left.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 486: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 500, [output]:  There are three days: Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.  Let's solve it day by day.  On Tuesday, they make 125 chimichangas.  On Wednesday, they also make 125 chimichangas.  On Friday, they make twice as many, which is 2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas.  In total, they make 125 + 125 + 250 = 500 chimichangas.  The answer is 500. 
[EXP] 487: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20% of the microphones won't fit in a pair, so let's first find out how many microphones won't fit in a pair.  20% of 50 is 10, because 10 is 20% of 50.  The singer will not arrange the 10 microphones in a pair, so he will only arrange 50 - 10 = 40 microphones in pairs.  The number of pairs is equal to the number of microphones arranged divided by 2.  40 divided by 2 is 20, so the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs on the stage.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 488: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Jerry counts 6 birds nesting.  2/3 of 6 is 2/3 * 6 = 4. 4 birds are flying overhead.  3 groups of eight birds each is 3 x 8 = 24 birds feeding.  6 + 4 + 24 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 489: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 55 cookies were originally baked. 5 cookies were eaten, so 55 - 5 = 50 cookies left. 50 cookies are to be placed into 5 jars. 50 ÷ 5 = 10 cookies in each jar.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 490: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 5 orchids have 5 * 5 = 25 petals. 4 daisies have 4 * 10 = 40 petals. 40 - 25 = 15. 15 petals are more.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 491: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  There are originally 100 plants in Mrs.  Smith's garden.  One-fourth of them, which is 100 ÷ 4 = 25, are indoor plants.  So she has 100 - 25 = 75 plants left.  Two-thirds of them, which is (75 × 2) ÷ 3 = 50, are outdoor plants.   So she has 75 - 50 = 25 plants left which are flowering plants.  Now, as a percent of the total plants, we can find the answer as follows:  (25 ÷ 100) × 100 = 25%. 
[EXP] 492: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 55, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the speed of a thingamabob, which is not given.  But since a whatchamacallit spins 11 times faster than a thingamabob, and a whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second, we can set up an equation:

Speed of whatchamacallit = Speed of thingamabob x 11

Speed of whatchamacallit = x * 11
121 = x * 11

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 11:

x = 121 / 11
x = 11

So the speed of a thingamabob is 11 meters per second.  Now, a whirligig spins at 5 times the speed of a thingamabob:

Speed of whirligig = Speed of thingamabob * 5
= 11 * 5
= 55

The answer is 55 meters per second. 
[EXP] 493: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Ellen eats two carrots, a salad, and a yogurt every day.  The salad costs $6, while the yogurt is half the price, which means the yogurt costs $3.  So, in total, Ellen pays $6 + $3 = $9 for the salad and yogurt.  Since she pays $11 in total, that means she pays $11 - $9 = $2 for the two carrots.  Since she eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot is $2 ÷ 2 = $1.  The answer is $1. 
[EXP] 494: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 480, [output]:  Mark works for 8 hours a day for 5 days a week, so the total number of hours worked in a week is 8 * 5 = 40 hours.  If his original pay is $10 per hour, he would make 40 * 10 = 400 dollars a week.  After a raise of $2 an hour, his new hourly pay is 10 + 2 = 12 dollars.  His new weekly pay is 40 * 12 = 480.  The answer is 480. 
[EXP] 495: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Let's first find out how many times Tasha mowed lawns in total before moving on to the lemonade.  She mowed lawns for Joe, Kamala, and Alba.  If she mowed Joe's lawn for $6, then it means she mowed 1 lawn for Joe.  Then, if Kamala's lawn was three times as much work, then she mowed 1 x 3 = 3 lawns for Kamala.   If Alba's lawn was 5 times as much work, then she mowed 1 x 5 = 5 lawns for Alba.  So in total, she mowed 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 lawns.  Each of these lawns cost $6, so in total, she earned 6 x 9 = 54 dollars from mowing lawns.    She made a total of $80, so subtracting the $54 from mowing lawns, she must have made $80 - $54 = $26 from lemonade sales.   The answer is $26. 
[EXP] 496: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 74, [output]:  Martin's weight is 55 kg.  Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight.  So Carl's weight is 55 + 16 = 71 kg.  Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight.  So Christian's weight is 71 + 8 = 79 kg.  Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.   So Harry's weight is 79 - 5 = 74 kg.  The answer is 74 kg. 
[EXP] 497: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  John rents his car 10 times a month.  He rents the car for 3 hours each time, so he rents the car for 10 x 3 = 30 hours in total.   He is paid 25 dollars an hour, so he makes 30 x 25 = 750 dollars.   He has a car payment of 500 dollars, so his profit is 750 - 500 = 250.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 498: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Martha started with some number of notebooks, and Joseph had 3 times that number.  Let's say Martha had x notebooks.   Then Joseph had 3x notebooks.   Martha bought 5 more notebooks, so she now has x + 5 notebooks.   And Joseph still has 3x.   We want to know how many more notebooks Martha has than Joseph.   That is (x + 5) - 3x = -2x + 5.  To find out how many notebooks Martha had initially, we know she now has 7 and bought 5.   So x = 2.  Since Martha had 2 notebooks initially, she now has 2 + 5 = 7 notebooks.  Joseph has 3x = 3 * 2 = 6 notebooks.  Martha has 7 - 6 = 1 more notebook than Joseph.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 499: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Dijana rowed 50 miles. 1/5 of 50 is 10. 10 more miles plus 50 is 60. 50 + 60 = 110. 110 miles were rowed by Dijana and Anis.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 500: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Susan had 100 cookies originally. 4 cookies were stolen, so she has 100 - 4 = 96 cookies left.  She wants to divide the cookies equally between 6 nephews, so each nephew gets 96 / 6 = 16 cookies.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 501: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

First, we know that Daniel read 13 pages yesterday.  Denise read 10 pages yesterday.  That means Daniel read 3 pages more than Denise.  Denise read 5 more pages than Daniel read yesterday, so Denise read 13 + 5 = 18 pages today.  Daniel didn't read any pages today. 

Now we can compare how many pages each of them read in total.   Denise read 10 + 18 = 28 pages in total.  Daniel read 13 + 0 = 13 pages in total.  Denise read 28 - 13 = 15 pages more than Daniel.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 502: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 4 bowls for adults, or 8 bowls for children. 1 adult (Calvin) and 1 adult (his wife) makes 2 adult bowls.  2 children makes 2 smaller bowls. 2 + 2 = 4 bowls.  So 8 - 4 = 4 bowls leftover for the children.  Since there are 2 children, we can divide 4 bowls by 2. 4 ÷ 2 = 2.  So each child will have a bowl of soup for lunch 2 times.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 503: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  William bought 5 notebooks at $1. 5 each.  5 x 1. 5 = 7. 5.  Then he bought a ballpen at $0. 5.   So in total he spent 7. 5 + 0. 5 = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 504: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]:  We need to find out how much material she would need for 20 small and 8 large masks.  We can find out how much material she uses for one small mask and one large mask. 2 yards of material gives us 4 small masks.  2. 25 yards of material gives us 3 large masks.  So one small mask takes \frac{2}{4} yards, and one large mask takes \frac{2. 25}{3} yards.  20 small masks will take 20\times\frac{2}{4} = 10 yards of material.   8 large masks will take 8\cdot\frac{2. 25}{3} = 5 yards of material.  So the total material needed will be 5+10=15 yards.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 505: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 9 movies, each 3 times, means 9 x 3 = 27 times Deepa saw the movies. 216 dollars in total means 216 / 27 = 8 dollars per ticket.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 506: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Harold sleeps for 10 hours.  He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps.  So he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours.   And he walks his dog for 1 hour.   The total hours of Harold's day are 24.  So, - sleeps for 10 hours, - works for 8 hours and - walks for 1 hour, that leaves him with 24 - (10 + 8 + 1) hours for free time.   That equals 24 - 19 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 507: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  There are 7 blue shoeboxes. 3 blue shoeboxes were used for fishing, so 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes are left. 

There are 9 red shoeboxes. 1/3 * 9 = 3 red shoeboxes were used for fishing.  9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes are left. 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes are left in total. 4 + 6 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 508: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Sarah has 9 books.  Joseph has twice that amount, which is 9 x 2 = 18.  Joseph lost 2 books, so he now has 18 - 2 = 16 books.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 509: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 1/5 of 30 is 6. 6 + 10 is 16. 30 - 16 is 14.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 510: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step:

Duncan's age 8 years ago was two times Adam's age 4 years ago.  Let's call Adam's age 4 years ago "x".  So, Duncan's age 8 years ago was 2x. 

Now, we know Duncan's current age is 60.  To find his age 8 years ago, we subtract 8 from his current age: 

60 - 8 = 52

So, Duncan's age 8 years ago was 52.  Since his age 8 years ago was 2x, we can set it equal to 52:

2x = 52

To solve for x, we divide both sides by 2:

x = 52 ÷ 2
x = 26

So, Adam's age 4 years ago was 26.  To find Adam's future age in 8 years, we add 8 to his current age:
Adam's current age is unknown, but let's call it "y".   Four years ago, he was y - 4.   Eight years from now, he will be y + 8. 

Adam's age four years ago was 26, so we set up the equation:

y - 4 = 26

To solve for y, we add 4 to both sides:

y = 30

So, Adam's current age is 30.  In 8 years, his age will be:

y + 8 = 30 + 8
y + 8 = 38

The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 511: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  Farmer Brown's farm has 200 acres. 200 * 2 = 400, and 400 + 100 = 500.  So farmer Smith's farm has 500 acres.  Then, in total, they have 500 + 200 = 700 acres.  The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 512: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Colby works for a manufacturing company.  He gets paid $0. 20 for every package he completes.   He completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour.   So he completes 50 - 10 = 40 packages per hour.   

He works for 8 hours.   For each hour he completes 40 packages.  So in 8 hours, he completes 40 * 8 = 320 packages.    
He is paid $\ 0. 20 for each package.  So his pay is $ 0. 20 * 320 = $ 64.  The answer is \$64. 
[EXP] 513: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.  That means one bottle of water every 30 minutes.  For a normal sudoku puzzle, it takes him 45 minutes.   45 minutes is 3 half hours so he will drink 3 bottles for a normal sudoku puzzle.   An extreme sudoku takes 4 times that long.  4 * 45 = 180.   180 minutes is 6 half hours so he will drink 6 bottles for an extreme sudoku.  So the total number of bottles John will drink for both normal and extreme sudoku is the sum of 3 and 6.     3 + 6 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 514: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Let's start by solving for the total amount of bologna thrown at the red balloons.  Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon, and there are 20 red balloons.  So the total amount of bologna thrown at the red balloons is 20 * 2 = 40.  That is 40 pieces of bologna.  Then we know that Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna in total.   So the amount of bologna thrown at the yellow balloons was 58 - 40 = 18.   

Each yellow balloon receives 3 pieces of bologna, so the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 515: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 100 miles a day is 100 * 30 = 3000 miles for the entire month.  3000 miles divided by 1000 miles per tune-up is 3000 / 1000 = 3.  The answer is 3.

[EXP] 517: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Let's first find the total amount of money Julia and Nadine had:

The cake cost $11, and they bought 1 dozen balloons for $0. 5 for 2 balloons. 12 / 2 = 6, so 6 sets of 2 balloons.  6 x $0. 5 = $3.  Total cost of cake and balloons is $11 + $3 = $14.  They also bought 2 tubs of ice cream for $7 each, which is $7 x 2 = $14.  Total cost of everything is $14 + $14 = $28. 

Let x be the amount of allowance each girl received.  Then the total amount they received was 2x.  Since 2x = 28, x = 28 / 2 = 14.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 518: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Kira bought 3 apples, 5 bananas, and 6 oranges, so in total she bought 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 pieces of fruit.  Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit, so Kira now has 14 - 2 = 12 pieces of fruit left.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 519: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 56, [output]: 6 students are playing tennis. 6 x 2 is 12, so there are 12 students playing volleyball. 16 boys and 22 girls are playing soccer.  So in total there are 16 + 22 = 38 soccer players. 

There are 6 students playing tennis, and 12 playing volleyball, so that is 18 students. 18 + 38 is 56.  The answer is 56. 
[EXP] 520: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 30 students each sold 10 lollipops. 30 x 10 is 300 lollipops. 300 lollipops were sold at $0. 8 each. 300 x $0. 8 is $240. 300 lollipops were bought at $0. 5 each. 300 x $0.  5 is $150.  So to find out how much profit they made, subtract 150 (what they spent) from 240 (what they made). 240 - 150 is 90.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 521: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 47, [output]:  Larry started with 3 cats.  He has 3 times as many dogs as cats, so he has 3 * 3 = 9 dogs.   He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs, so he has 9 - 2 = 7 rabbits.   He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits, so he has 3 * 7 = 21 fish.   He has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has, so he has (1/3) * 21 = 7 gerbils. 

In total, Larry has 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 21 fish, and 7 gerbils.  3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47 pets.  The answer is 47. 
[EXP] 522: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 24 slices of bread.  Abby eats 2 slices a day.  Josh eats twice as much, which is 2 x 2 = 4 slices a day.  Abby eats 2 slices a day, Josh eats 4 slices a day, so in total they eat 2 + 4 = 6 slices per day.  

For 6 slices to be removed each day, the bread will last for 24 / 6 = 4 days.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 523: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Martha starts collecting shells at the age of 5, and will be 10 by the end of this process, so she will have collected for 10 - 5 = 5 years. 5 years is the same as 5 x 12 months = 60 months.  She collects 1 shell every month, so she will have collected 1 x 60 = 60 shells by her 10th birthday.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 524: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 1.  Initially Lana has 27 cups of tea and divides them into 3 rows.  So, each row will have 27 / 3 = 9 cups of tea. 
2.  Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row.  Let's assume each row has x mint tea cups and y chamomile tea cups.  The problem states, "In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. "  So, x = y. 
3.   Lana then uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea.   Initially, she has 27 cups of tea and lends 9 * 2 (as she has 3 rows) = 18 cups for chamomile and mint tea.   This leaves her with 27 - 18 = 9 cups.  She uses 15 cups for cinnamon tea.   So, the remaining cups will be 9 - 15 = -6 cups.  This does not make sense, as we cannot have negative cups. 
4.   We went wrong somewhere.   Let's think again.  If Lana uses the remaining cups for 15 cups of cinnamon tea, then the total number of cups lent for chamomile and mint should be 27 - 15 = 12 cups.    As she lends them equally among the 3 rows, each row will have 12 / 3 = 4 mint tea cups.  In each row, she creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups.   So, there are also 4 chamomile tea cups in each row.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 525: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Since the sloth only eats when in the tree, he only moves up and down the tree.  He spends 4 hours per trip, so in 8 hours, he can only make 2 trips (8/4 = 2).   Each trip, he picks the same number of berries.  If he picks x berries per trip, then x * 2 = 24, so x = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 526: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2000, [output]: 10000 gallons of water were originally in the pool. 10000 / 2 = 5000 was filled into the tank. 5000 gallons is the starting amount in the tank. 500 gallons of water are used each day. 6 days pass. 6 * 500 = 3000 gallons used. 5000 - 3000 = 2000.  The answer is 2000. 
[EXP] 527: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 150 dollars is given by parents.  5 movie tickets for $10 each on Friday/Saturday will cost 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  8 movie tickets for $7 each will cost 8 x 7 = 56 dollars.  2 popcorns for 8 dollars each will cost 16 dollars.  4 boxes of candy for 2 dollars each will cost 8 dollars.  In total, he spent 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 dollars.  So he has 150 - 130 = 20 dollars left.  Since the remaining day is also a Friday, he can buy a movie ticket that costs 10 dollars.   Then he'll be left with 20 - 10 = 10 dollars.  He can't buy another movie ticket since that would exceed 150 dollars.   So he can only watch 1 more movie.  Therefore, the answer is 1. 
[EXP] 528: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 85000, [output]:  Andrew baked 200 mini cinnamon rolls and 300 mini blueberry muffins.  Each mini cinnamon roll has 1/3rd of 600 calories which is 600/3 = 200 calories.  Each mini blueberry muffin has 1/3rd of 450 calories which is 450/3 = 150 calories. 200 mini cinnamon rolls have 200 x 200 = 40000 calories. 300 mini blueberry muffins have 300 x 150 = 45000 calories.   40000 + 45000 = 85000.  The answer is 85000. 
[EXP] 529: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Rita removed 39 Junebugs on Monday.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day.   So she removed a total of 39 + 78 + 78 = 195 Junebugs for these three days.   On Thursday and Friday, she removed a total of 48 + 57 = 105 Junebugs.   So in total, she removed 195 + 105 = 300 Junebugs over 5 days.  To find the average, we divide by 5 days:  300 / 5 = 60 Junebugs per day.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 530: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Since the bus travels 60 miles per hour for 5 hours, the distance it travels is 60 * 5 = 300 miles.  The car travels 30 miles per hour for 8 hours, so the distance it travels is 30 * 8 = 240 miles.  To find the difference in distance, we subtract the distance the car traveled from the distance the bus traveled. 300 - 240 = 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 531: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Sophie has a total of 62 toys.  Originally, she had 31 blocks, 8 stuffed animals, and 9 stacking rings. 31 + 8 + 9 = 48. 62 - 48 = 14. 14 must be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 532: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Let's start with Paul's age.  Since Paul is 10 years older than Jean, Paul's age is J + 10, where J is Jean's age. 

Also, Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age.  So Peter's age is (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10. 

The problem states that the combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.  So, we can set up an equation:

(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100

Combine like terms:

4J + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4J = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

J = 20

So Jean's age is 20 years. 

Now that we know Jean's age, we can find Paul's age:

Paul's age = Jean's age + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30

And finally, we can find Peter's age:

Peter's age = Paul's age + Jean's age = 30 + 20 = 50

The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 533: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Initially, each of Maria's 4 friends had 2 water balloons, so 4 x 2 = 8 water balloons.  Maria had 1 water balloon, so in total there were 8 + 1 = 9 water balloons.   Then, they got 3 more water balloons each, so 3 x 5 = 15 water balloons. 9 + 15 is 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 534: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 10 people donate 5 boxes of stuff each. 10 x 5 = 50 boxes. 50 + 10 = 60 boxes in total. 60 boxes in total divided by 2 boxes per table is 60/2 = 30 tables.  They already own 15 tables, so they need 30 - 15 = 15 more tables.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 535: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 410, [output]:  Zoey has 40 seeds.  She spits each one 10 feet.  So she spits 40 x 10 = 400 feet. 

Sydney has 35 seeds.  She spits each one 12 feet.  So she spits 35 x 12 = 420 feet.  

To find the average total distance spat, we need to add the total distance spat by both and then divide it by the number of people.  Zoey + Sydney = 400 + 420 = 820.  And there are 2 people.  820 / 2 = 410.  The answer is 410. 
[EXP] 536: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 64800, [output]: eworking the problem:

Let's first calculate the total number of widgets made by each machine in 30 days:

Widgeteer 3000: 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 43,200 widgets

WidgetMaster 9000: 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days = 32,400 widgets

Next, let's calculate the total revenue generated by each machine:

Widgeteer 3000: 43,200 widgets * $6/widget = $259,200

WidgetMaster 9000: 32,400 widgets * $6/widget = $194,400

Finally, let's calculate the difference in revenue between the two machines:

$259,200 (Widgeteer 3000) - $194,400 (WidgetMaster 9000) = $64,800

So, the Widgeteer 3000 will generate $64,800 more in revenue than the WidgetMaster 9000 over the same period of time.  The answer is 64,800. 
[EXP] 537: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]:  Cameron wants to stay for 17 hours (10 am - 5 pm). 12 hours of the stay is 1000 pesos. 5 more hours will be 5 x 70 = 350 pesos. 1000 + 350 = 1350 pesos. 
If Cameron had paid for a 24-hour stay, it would have cost 1600 pesos.  The amount he would have saved is 1600 - 1350 = 250 pesos.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 538: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 159, [output]: 15 goats each need 5 pounds of hay.  So, that's 15 x 5 = 75 pounds for the goats.  Each sheep needs 2 x 5 = 10 pounds of hay, but then subtracts 3 pounds, so each sheep needs 10 - 3 = 7 pounds. 12 sheep will use 12 x 7 = 84 pounds of hay.   In total, Nate will need 75 + 84 = 159 pounds of hay.  The answer is 159. 
[EXP] 539: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]: 1.  John worked for 6 hours, earning 6 x 50 = 300 dollars.  He spends 50 dollars on gas, leaving him with 300 - 50 = 250 dollars.  He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, leaving him with 250 - 100 = 150 dollars.  He buys 5 pencils for 10 dollars each, so that's 5 x 10 = 50 dollars.  That leaves him with 150 - 50 = 100 dollars.   This amount can buy 100 / 25 = 4 25 dollar pens.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 540: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 650, [output]:  Craig spelled out 10 rounds of words with 15 letters each.  So the total number of letters for Craig is 10 * 15 = 150.  If his brother has 50 more, that means his brother spelled 150 + 50 = 200 letters.   When you combine the letters Craig and his brother spelled, you get 150 + 200 = 350.  The answer is 350. 
[EXP] 541: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 280, [output]: 8 children are in each row. 7 rows are for each of 5 schools.  So for each school, there are 8 x 7 = 56 children.  Since there are 5 schools, we can multiply 56 by 5. 56 x 5 = 280.  The answer is 280. 
[EXP] 542: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 842, [output]: 29 pupils will each get 2 bottles of apple juice, so the total number of bottles of apple juice used is 29 x 2 = 58.  Each coupon gives 100 bottles, so the teacher can redeem 9 coupons for 9 x 100 = 900 bottles.  Overall, the teacher has 900 - 58 = 842 bottles of apple juice left.  The teacher can use her 9 coupons to get the bottles, so the answer is 842. 
[EXP] 543: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 205, [output]:  [.  The labor cost will be based on 2. 25 hours.  As you cannot have a fraction of an hour, we can round the hours to 2 (because 2. 25 is between 2 and 3).   So, the labor cost will be 2 x 35 = 70.  The total amount to be charged will be 40 (which is the service call) plus 70 (which is the labor) plus 60 (which is the parts). 40 + 70 + 60 = 170.  The answer is 170. 
[EXP] 544: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  James gets 10 new CDs.   Each CD costs $15.  So in total the CDs cost 10 x 15 = 150 dollars.   However, he gets 40% off, which means the price gets reduced by 40% of 150.  40% of 150 is 0. 4 * 150 = 60.   So the price gets reduced by 60.   The new total cost is 150 - 60 = 90 dollars.   James spends 90 dollars on the CDs. 

Then he decides to sell 5 of them.  He gets 40 dollars for them.  So he gets 40 dollars in return.  To find out how much money he was "out", we calculate 90 - 40.  90 - 40 = 50.   The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 545: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 6 yams at $1. 5 each will earn 6 * $1. 5 = $9. 10 sweet potatoes at $2 each will earn 10 * $2 = $20.  4 carrots at $1. 25 each will earn 4 * $1.  25 = $5.  So she will earn $9 + $20 + $5 = $34 dollars.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 546: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step:

1.  James swims 60% of the 20-mile lake.  To find 60% of 20, multiply 20 by 0. 60, which is 12.   So he swims 12 miles. 
2.   James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.   To find the time it takes to swim 12 miles, divide 12 by 2, which is 6 hours.  This is his swimming time. 
3.    He then rests for half as long as the swimming time.    Half of 6 hours is 3 hours. 
4.  Finally, he swims the remaining 8 miles (20 - 12 = 8) at half his original speed.  Half of 2 miles per hour is 1 mile per hour. 
5.    To find the time it takes to swim the remaining 8 miles at 1 mile per hour, divide 8 by 1, which is 8 hours.  

Adding up the total time, James spent 6 hours swimming, 3 hours resting, and 8 hours swimming at a slower pace.  The answer is 17 hours.

[EXP] 549: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  LET'S BREAK IT DOWN STEP BY STEP

1.  **New York Times**: Cayley sells 6 copies, each for 5 dollars. 5 x 6 = 30 dollars total in sales.  A 10% commission on 30 dollars is 10% x 30 = 3 dollars.  So the total commission from New York Times is 3 dollars. 

2.   **Wall Street Journal**: Cayley sells 10 copies, each for 15 dollars.  15 x 10 = 150 dollars total in sales.   An 8% commission on 150 dollars is 8% x 150 = 12 dollars.   So the total commission from Wall Street Journal is 12 dollars. 


Now, let's find the total commission Cayley gets from the newspaper sales: 

3.  **Total Commission**: The total commission is the sum of the commission from New York Times and Wall Street Journal.  3 + 12 = 15 dollars.  The answer is 15 dollars. 
[EXP] 550: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]:  Since Deanna is 26, Marcus is 26 - 5 = 21.  Marcus is also half of Leo's age, so Leo's age is 21 * 2 = 42.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 551: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's break down the information:

* Bahati scored the most points, so let's call her score "B".  Azibo scored 20 less than Bahati, so Azibo's score is B - 20.  Dinar scored 10 less than Bahati, so Dinar's score is B - 10. 
* The total score is 45 points, so we can write the equation: B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45

Combine like terms: 3B - 30 = 45

Add 30 to both sides: 3B = 75

Divide by 3: B = 25

So Bahati scored 25 points.  Azibo scored 25 - 20 = 5 points.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 552: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Since each paper is printed on both sides, we are considering both sides as one page. 100 pages to the inch means 100 pages on one side.  Since we are considering both sides, we have 200 pages per inch. 

We know the book is 1. 5 inches thick.  Multiply 1. 5 inches by the number of pages per inch to find the total number of pages in the book. 200 * 1. 5 is 300.  So the book has 300 pages.   The answer is 300.

[EXP] 554: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 452, [output]:  Kim goes to sleep at 10 p. m.  and usually wakes up at 6 a. m.  Usually, she sleeps for 6 - 10 = 8 hours, which is 8 * 60 = 480 minutes. 

She woke up 5 minutes early to go to the bathroom.  So that means she woke up at 6 - 5 = 5:55 a.  m.  

She was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.   m.   to 2:38 a.   m.   That is 2:38 - 2:15 = 23 minutes.  She was awake for that time.  So she slept normally from 5:55 a.  m.  to 2:15 a.    m.    and from 2:38 a.    m.   to 6 a.    m.  Let's subdivide the day into two parts: 5:55 a.  to 2:15 a.    and 2:38 a.

After giving 6 away, he has 16 - 6 = 10 measuring spoons left.  To find the total utensils left, add 10 spoons to 24 cups.  24 + 10 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 556: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]: 1/5 of 1000 is 200.  So there are 200 occupied beds, and 1000 - 200 = 800 unoccupied beds.  After 2 weeks, 14 days, 50 patients are admitted each day.  So that's a total of 50 * 14 = 700 patients.  200 occupied beds + 700 admitted beds = 900 occupied beds.  Now we need to subtract these from the 1000 total beds to get the number of unoccupied beds. 1000 - 900 = 100 unoccupied beds.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 557: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 16 emails per day. 7 are work emails. 16 - 7 = 9, so 9 are non-work emails.  2/3 of 9 are to family. 2/3 * 9 = 6, so she sends 6 family emails.  9 - 6 = 3, so she sends 3 emails that are not family or work.  One-third of 3 are to her boyfriend. 1/3 * 3 = 1, so she sends 1 email per day to her boyfriend.  The answer is 1. 
[EXP] 558: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Since Aliya is 3 years old, Shawna is 3 x 3 = 9 years old.  Since her father is 5 times as old as Shawna, he is 5 x 9 = 45 years old.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 559: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 40, [output]:  Since the audience was overstated by 20%, that means the correct attendance was 80% of the reported 48 people. 

let's calculate 80% of 48:
48 x 0. 8 = 38. 4

So the correct attendance was 38 people.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 560: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Coach brings one bag of basketballs.  Jordan carries 2 times as many as Jason.   Jason carries 2 times as many as Jeffrey.  

Let's say Jeffrey carried X balls.  Then Jason carried 2X balls.  

Because Jordan carries twice as many as Jason, Jordan carries 2 * 2X = 4X balls.  

In total, they have Jeffrey's balls + Jason's balls + Jordan's balls = X + 2X + 4X.  Since they all carried balls in one trip, the total number of balls they carried = the number of balls the coach brought to practice.   And we know Jason carried 2 balls.   So 2 = 2X.  X = 1.   

Now we can find the total number of balls coach brought.  X + 2X + 4X = 7X.   We know X is 1, and so the answer is 7 * 1 = 7. 
[EXP] 561: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  The pirates started with 10 holes.  On the second day they dug 13 more, so there were 10 + 13 = 23 holes.  Then, on the third day, they dug 8 more, but stopped digging to fill in 2 holes, so that's a net gain of 8 - 2 = 6 holes.  So they had 23 + 6 = 29 holes after the third day.  Then, on the fourth day, they had 4 times as many holes as they did at the end of the first day, so that's 4 x 10 = 40.  Since they already had 29 holes, they dug 40 - 29 = 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 562: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 225, [output]: 2 people got 70 chips each, so that's 2 * 70 = 140 chips.  The third person got 15 more chips than the 70 chips those 2 people got, so they got 70 + 15 = 85 chips.  Adding all 3 numbers together, we get 140 + 85 = 225 chips.  The answer is 225. 
[EXP] 563: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1000, [output]:  The travel costs can be represented as the cost of supplies + 50% of cost of supplies. 50% of cost of supplies is 50 / 100 * 400 = 200. 200 + 400 = 600.  The answer is 600. 
[EXP] 564: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 147, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught.  Let's call the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught x.  Then, Stan has caught 4x - 13. 

Next, we know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, so Alex has caught (4x - 13) + 5.  This is equal to 4x - 8. 

We also know that together, they have caught 339 Pokémon, so we can set up the equation:

x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339

Combine like terms:

9x - 21 = 339

Add 21 to both sides:

9x = 360

Divide by 9:

x = 40

Now we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokémon.  Stan has caught 4 times as many as Adelwolfe, minus 13, so Stan has caught 4 * 40 - 13 = 153.  The answer is 153. 
[EXP] 565: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]:  John just started watching a new show.  Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode. 

Let's figure out the number of episodes first.  Half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode means there are half of 20 minutes, which is 20 / 2 = 10 episodes.  Now we know there are 10 episodes.  To find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show if he watches every episode, we multiply the number of minutes per episode by the number of episodes.  

20 (minutes per episode) * 10 (number of episodes) = 200 minutes

The answer is 200. 
[EXP] 566: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 374, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  For the first leg of the trip, the bird flies south for 10 hours at 30 miles per hour.  To find the distance flown, we use the formula d = rt, where d is distance, r is rate, and t is time.  In this case, the rate is 30 miles per hour and the time is 10 hours.  So the distance flown is:

d = 30 x 10 = 300 miles

Next, the bird flies north for 2 hours at 18 miles per hour.   Here again, we use the formula d = rt, where d is distance, r is rate, and t is time.  In this case, the rate is 18 miles per hour and the time is 2 hours.  So the distance flown is:

d = 18 x 2 = 36 miles

Then, the bird flies south again for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.   To find the distance flown, we again use the formula d = rt, where d is distance, r is rate, and t is time.  In this case, the rate is 22 miles per hour and the time is 5 hours.   So the distance flown is:

d = 22 x 5 = 110 miles

Finally, we add together the three distances to find the total distance flown:

300 + 36 + 110 = 446 miles

The bird's northern and southern homes are 446 miles apart.  The answer is 446. 
[EXP] 567: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 48, [output]: 12 = one dozen.  So Greta had 1 dozen brownies initially.  Then she got 1/2 a dozen more, which is 6 brownies.  So in total, she had 12 + 6 = 18 brownies.  At her surprise party, her friends gave her 4 dozen, which is 48 brownies.  So in total she had 18 + 48 = 66 brownies.  During the party, 1 and 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten, which is 18 brownies.  So she had 66 - 18 = 48 brownies left.   The answer is 48. 
[EXP] 568: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  If Nani's brother is 2 times Nani's age, and Nani is 8, then his brother is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.  Nani's sister is 25% younger than Nani, so she is 8 - 8 * (25/100) = 8 - 2 = 6 years old.   To find the total age of all three family members, add them together.  8 + 16 + 6 is 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 569: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 227, [output]: 3 racquets will be strung with synthetic gut, so it will take 3 * 15 = 45 minutes. 5 racquets will be strung with polyester string, so it will take 5 * 22 = 110 minutes. 4 racquets will be strung with hybrid sets, so it will take 4 * 18 = 72 minutes.  To figure out how much time it will take in total, you have to add all the times together. 45 + 110 + 72 is 227.  The answer is 227 minutes. 
[EXP] 570: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1800, [output]:  John bought phones for 4 people, including himself.  The first two phones cost 2 * 600 = 1200.  The other two phones are half price, or 600 / 2 = 300 each.   Then the total cost is 1200 + 300 + 300 = 1800.  The answer is 1800. 
[EXP] 571: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 33, [output]:  Zeke's team has 7 more players.  Carlton's team has 13.  So Zeke's team has 13 + 7 = 20 players.   The answer is the sum of the players in both teams: 13 + 20 = 33. 
[EXP] 572: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  To find the total length of slats Robert will need, we need to calculate the perimeter of the garden.  The perimeter is the distance around the fence. 

Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
= 2(15 + 10)
= 2 x 25
= 50

Robert needs 2 slats for every foot of fencing, so for 50 feet of fencing, he needs:
50 x 2 = 100
slats

The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 573: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Mrs.  Harrington started with 12 boxes of oranges.  Each box has 20 oranges, so there are 12 x 20 = 240 oranges.  She gave 2 boxes (40 oranges) to her mom and 2 boxes (40 oranges) to her sister.  So she had 240 - 40 - 40 = 160 oranges left.  She then kept 1/4 of the oranges.  160 / 4 = 40 oranges.  So she had 160 - 40 = 120 oranges left to sell.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 574: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 79, [output]:  The USA has 50 states.  Half of that is 25. 4 more than half would be 25 + 4 = 29. 29 is the number of states India has, since it's 4 more than half the USA's number.  Since India has 29 states, and the USA has 50 states, in total there are 29 + 50 = 79 states in both countries together.  The answer is 79. 
[EXP] 575: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Tyler needs to buy a dictionary for $18, a dinosaur book for $13, and a children's cookbook for $8. 18 + 13 + 8 = 39 dollars.  He has 14 dollars saved, so he needs to earn 39 - 14 = 25 dollars more.  If he earns 5 dollars per hour, then he needs to work for 25 / 5 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 576: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Since Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, we can write an equation:

Robert - Richard = 10

We know that Robert has 30 cherries, so we can set up another equation:

Robert = 30

Now we can substitute the value of Robert into the first equation:

30 - Richard = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Richard = 20

So Richard has 20 cherries.  Since Robert and Richard have a total of 30 + 20 = 50 cherries, Jerry must have 60 - 50 = 10 cherries.  To find out how many cherries Robert has more than Jerry, we can subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert's cherries:

30 (Robert) - 10 (Jerry) = 20

The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 577: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 540, [output]:  On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and X boxes of apple pie, where X is 10 fewer than the number of boxes of apple pie he sold on Sunday.  Let's start with Sunday.  He sold 15 boxes of apple pie.  Since he sold 10 fewer boxes than on Sunday on Saturday, he sold X = 15 - 10 = 5 boxes of apple pie on Saturday. 

Let's look at the number of boxes of gingerbread.   He sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread on Sunday than on Saturday.   On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread.   So on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread. 

Now let's calculate the total amount of money he earned on Saturday.  He sells 10 boxes of gingerbread (10 * 6 = 60 dollars) and 5 boxes of apple pie (5 * 15 = 75 dollars).  He earned 60 + 75 dollars, which is 135 dollars. 

On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of gingerbread (15 * 6 = 90 dollars) and 15 boxes of apple pie (15 * 15 = 225 dollars).   He earned 90 + 225 = 315 dollars. 

To find out how much he earned for two days, we add 135 + 315 = 450 dollars.  The answer is 450. 
[EXP] 578: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Pamela reapplies sunscreen every hour and is outside for 4 hours a day.  So she reapplies sunscreen 4 times a day.  Since she spends 8 days on vacation, she reapplies sunscreen a total of 4 * 8 = 32 times.   She reapplies an ounce each time, so she will need 32 ounces of sunscreen.   Since her sunscreen comes in 8-ounce bottles, she will need 32 / 8 = 4 bottles of sunscreen.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 579: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]: 40% cheaper means the red car costs 40% less than the blue car.  Since the blue car costs $100, the red car costs 100 - (40/100 * 100) = 100 - 40 = $60. 

The blue car costs $100 and the red car costs $60. 100 + 60 is 160.  The answer is 160. 
[EXP] 580: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

1.  When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.  So, his dad's age will be 2 x 24 = 48. 
2.  When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.  So, his brother's age will be 24/2 = 12.  If his brother will be 12 when Emil turns 24, that means his brother is 12 - 5 = 7 years younger than Emil now.  Emil is 19 now, so his brother is 19 - 7 = 12 years old now. 
3.   Since his dad's age will be 48 when Emil turns 24, his dad is currently 48 - 5 = 43 years old.  So, the sum of the ages of his dad and his brother is 12 + 43 = 55.  The answer is 55. 
[EXP] 581: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Adrianne started with 20 metallic beads.  Her sister gave her 10 more than her mother, so that's 10 + 20 = 30 beads.  Her friend gave her twice as many as her mother, so that's 2 x 20 = 40 beads.   In total, she has 20 + 30 + 40 beads.  20 + 30 + 40 is 90.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 582: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.  Then he caught 4 times that amount on Friday, which is 4 * 3 = 12 pounds.  Then he caught half the amount of his Friday catch on Saturday, which is 12 / 2 = 6 pounds.  In total, Joe caught 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 pounds of crawfish.  1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, so Joe has 21 / 3 = 7 servings.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 583: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 20% of the 30 students are football players. 20% of 30 is the same as 20 / 100 x 30 = 6.  So 6 students are football players.  If we remove the football players from the group, we have 30 - 6 = 24 students left.   25% of that group are cheerleaders or part of band. 25% of 24 is the same as 25 / 100 x 24 = 6.  So 6 students are cheerleaders or part of band.  The 6 football players and 6 cheerleaders or band students are leaving early.  6 + 6 = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 584: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Since Sophie wears size five boots, and Charlie's boots are five times larger than Sophie's, Charlie's boots are 5 x 5 = 25.  To find the average of the two sizes, we add the sizes together and divide by the number of sizes.  So, we add 5 + 25 = 30.  Then divide the sum by the number of sizes, which is 2.  The result is 30/2 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 585: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 342, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Pat wants to fill the entire flower bed with plants, so she needs to know how many plants can fit in the bed.  The flower bed is 111 feet long.  Pat's flowers grow 12 inches wide, and she needs to leave 1. 5 feet (18 inches) between each plant.  So the space between plants is 12 inches + 18 inches = 30 inches = 2. 5 feet.  72 inches.  

The flower bed is 111 feet long, which is 1332 inches.   Subtracting the space between plants gives 1332 - 72 = 1260, the total space for plants.  There are 12 inches in a foot, so 1260 inches = 105 feet.   So 105 plants can fit in the flower bed. 

Pat already owns 17 flowers, so she needs to buy 105 - 17 = 88 more flowers.  Each flowering plant costs $6 at the store.   To find the total cost, multiply 88 by 6: 88 x 6 = 528.   The answer is 528.

[EXP] 587: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 70, [output]:  Katherine has 5 hanging baskets.  Each basket needs 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines.   So we need to figure out how many of each plant she will need.  For petunias, it will be 5 baskets x 3 per basket = 15 petunias.   For sweet potato vines, it will be 5 baskets x 2 per basket = 10 sweet potato vines.  The cost of the petunias will be 15 x $3. 00 per petunia = $45.  The cost of the sweet potato vines will be 10 x $2. 50 per sweet potato vine = $25.  The total cost of the plants is $45 + $25 = $70.  The answer is $70.

In a year, there are 12 months, so she sets aside 12 * 500 = 6,000 for shoes.  She can afford to buy 6,000 / 1,000 = 6 shoes.   The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 590: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Let's first figure out how many shrimp Emily can peel and cook in 1 minute. 6 shrimp are peeled in 1 minute, and 30 shrimp are sautéed in 10 minutes.  30 / 10 = 3 shrimp sautéed per minute, so together Emily can peel and cook 6 + 3 = 9 shrimp per minute.  To find how many minutes it will take to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 9.   90 / 9 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 591: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step:

1.  The room starts at some temperature.  For the sake of simplicity, let's assume it starts at 100°F. 
2.  The air conditioner runs on low for 3 hours, cooling the room 2°F per hour.  This means it cools 3 x 2 = 6°F.   So the room temperature becomes 100 - 6 = 94°F.  After the air conditioner runs low for 3 hours, the temperature is now 94°F.  
3.   Now, the air conditioner is turned up to high and runs for 4 hours, cooling the room 3°F per hour.   This means it cools 4 x 3 = 12°F.    So the room temperature becomes 94 - 12 = 82°F.   After the air conditioner runs high for 4 hours, the temperature is now 82°F.  After the air conditioner runs both low and high for 3 + 4 = 7 hours, the final temperature is 82°F.  And then it stops running.   Over the next 2 hours, the room warms up 2°F per hour.    So it warms up 2 x 2 = 4°F.    The final temperature is 82 - 4 = 78°F.  The starting temperature was 100°F.  The room cooled by 100 - 78 = 22°F.  The answer is 22°F. 
[EXP] 592: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 75 years is the time it takes the comet to orbit the sun.  Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet.  Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times his dad's age: 3 * 30 = 90.  Bill saw the comet for the second time at the age of 90.  So he must have seen it for the first time at 90 - 75 = 15.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 593: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]: 1 check per month for the electric bill, 1 check per month for the gas bill, and 2 checks per month for the church is a total of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 checks per month. 4 checks per month times 12 months in a year is 4 x 12 = 48 checks. 

Additionally, Buford also writes a check every 3 months (quarterly) to the pest and lawn service.  There are 4 quarters in a year, so he writes 4 checks to the pest and lawn service. 48 checks for regular bills and 4 checks for quarterly bills is a total of 48 + 4 = 52 checks per year.  The answer is 52. 
[EXP] 594: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

The first plane makes a total of x flights.  Since it goes to Greece for 3/4 of its flights, the number of flights to Greece is 3x/4.  This means the number of flights to France and Germany together is x - 3x/4 = x/4.   Since these are split equally, the number of flights to France is x/8. 

We know that the second plane makes 44 trips, and this is half the number of flights the first plane makes.  So x/2 = 44, which means x = 88.  Now, the first plane makes a total of 88 flights, and the number of flights to France is x/8 = 11.  The answer is 11. 
[EXP] 595: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Tobias howls for 20 seconds.  Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote howls for 20 x 2 = 40 seconds.  Igneous howls for as long as Tobias and Chikote combined.  Tobias and Chikote combined are howling for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.   Igneous howls for 60 seconds.  In total, the three wolves are howling for 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 seconds.   Since there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, we need to divide the total time, in seconds, by 60 to get the time in minutes.   120 divided by 60 is 2.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
[EXP] 596: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Adam's mother gave him 6 dollars.  His father gave him twice as much.  Twice as much as 6 is 2 * 6 = 12.  So in total, his parents gave him 6 + 12 = 18 dollars.  He bought trousers for 30 dollars.  So he must have contributed 30 - 18 dollars from his savings.  30 - 18 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 597: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's start by calculating the total age of the group besides Akbar and Alessandro.  Akbar and Alessandro's ages are 3 and 4, and their total age is 7.  Since the total age of all four children is 20, the total age of the remaining two children is 20 - 7 = 13. 

Since Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, we can write an equation to represent Helene's age.  Let's denote Helene's age as h.   Then the average age of the group is 20/4 = 5.  Helene is twice this age, so Helene's age is 2*5 = 10.  Therefore, Helene is 10 years old. 

Now we can find Wilfred's age.   The total age of the remaining two children (Helene and Wilfred) is 13.   Helene is 10 years old, so Wilfred's age is 13 - 10 = 3.  The answer is 3.

The total parts are 4 (adult) + 4 (kids) = 8 parts.  The 2 adults get 4 parts out of a total of 8 parts.  That is 50% of the watermelon.  The answer is 50%. 
[EXP] 601: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 9 hours at the clinic for work time.  He'll spend 20 minutes * 9 inpatients on patient rounds, so that's 180 minutes.  180 minutes equals 3 hours.  He also has 10 appointments, which are 30 minutes each, so that's 10 * 30 = 300 minutes or 5 hours.  So in total he's spent 3 + 5 = 8 hours.  The answer is he will have 9 - 8 = 1 hour left to update his records. 
[EXP] 602: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's calculate the total time Jordan needs to make the cake.  It takes 20 minutes to make the batter and 30 minutes to bake.   That's 20 + 30 = 50 minutes.  Then it takes 2 hours to cool the cake.   That's 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes.   Finally, it takes 10 minutes to frost the cake.   In total, it takes 50 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes.   180 minutes is equivalent to 3 hours.   So Jordan needs 3 hours to make the cake.  She plans to make the cake to serve it at 5:00 pm.  If she needs 3 hours to make the cake, that means she would start making the cake at 2:00 pm at the latest.  The answer is 2:00 pm.

So in total they sold 3.  5 + 4.  5 = 7.  7 boxes.   Now we know they sold 64 chocolate bars together in 7 boxes.   To find the number of bars in a box, we can divide the total number of bars by the total number of boxes: 64 / 7 = 9.  So there are 9 bars in a box.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 604: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 480, [output]: 1) Calculate how many days the studio is rented in a month. 1 month has 30 days, but the dance studio is rented only 3 days a week, so it is rented 3 * 4 = 12 days in a month.  2) Calculate the total number of students.  There are 10 students.  3) Calculate the total earnings for each day of the week.  To rent the studio for 1 day costs $25.  There are 10 students and it costs $1. 50 per student.   So the total earnings for the day are 25 + (10 * 1. 5) = 25 + 15 = 40.  The studio makes $40 each day it is rented.   4) Calculate the total earnings for the month.   Since the studio is rented 12 days in a month, the total earnings in the month will be 12 * 40 = 480.  The answer is 480. 
[EXP] 605: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Peter has 64 chocolate bars in total.  Since he has 4 boxes, each box must have 64 / 4 = 16 chocolate bars.  Martha has 56 chocolate bars in total.   Since she has 7 boxes, each box must have 56 / 7 = 8 chocolate bars.  Peter has 16 - 8 = 8 more chocolate bars per box than Martha.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 606: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1490, [output]:  The total number of porcupines is 50 and the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population.  To find the number of female porcupines, multiply the total population by 3/5. 

50 * 3/5 = 30

So there are 30 female porcupines.  Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies each month.  There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies they give birth to is:

30 * 4 * 12 = 1440

The original population of porcupines is 50.  Adding the 1440 babies, we get:

50 + 1440 = 1490

So, after a year, the population of porcupines in the park will be 1490.  The answer is 1490. 
[EXP] 607: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 826, [output]:  The problem asks us to first calculate the volume of the pool, then multiply it by 5. 9 to find the total gallons of water needed.  To do that, we first need to find the area of the pool. 

The area of a rectangle is length x width.  In this case, the length is 25 feet, and the width is 14 feet.   25 x 14 = 350. 

Next, we need to multiply the area by the depth.   350 x 4 = 1400.  This gives us the volume of the pool in cubic feet.    To convert it to gallons, we multiply by 7. 5. 1400 x 7. 5 = 10500. 

The pool company will need 10500 gallons of water.  At $0.  10 per gallon, it will cost $105.  00 to fill the pool.   The answer is  $105. 
[EXP] 608: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 9 red sticks and 5 more blue sticks than red sticks, means 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks. 14 blue sticks and 3 less yellow sticks means 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.  9 (red) + 14 (blue) + 11 (yellow) = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 609: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]: 55 miles per hour for 4 hours is a total distance of 55 * 4 = 220 miles. 45 miles per hour for 10 hours is a total distance of 45 * 10 = 450 miles. 450 - 220 is 230.  Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 610: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1,875, [output]: 3000 students are enrolled in school.  Half of them are over 16, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500.  One-fourth of the students over 16 are male.  So, 1500 * 1/4 = 375 are male.  This leaves 1500 - 375 = 1125 female students over 16.   The remaining half, which is 3000 / 2 = 1500, are under 16.  One-half of them are male.  1500 * 1/2 = 750 are male.  This leaves 1500 - 750 = 750 female students under 16.  In total, there are 1125 + 750 = 1875 female students.  The answer is 1875. 
[EXP] 611: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many laps each person can run. 
Bethany can run 10 laps. 
Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, so Trey can run 10 + 4 = 14 laps. 
Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, so Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = 7 laps. 
Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, so Quinn can run 7 - 2 = 5 laps.  We need to find the difference in the number of laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn.  
Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps.  10 - 5 is 5.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 612: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6000, [output]:  A tank has a capacity of 18000 gallons.  Wanda and Ms.  B will fill it up in 2 days.  On the first day, Wanda pumped 1/4 of the tank's capacity.  1/4 of 18000 gallons is 4500 gallons.  Ms.  B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda.  So Ms.  B pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons.  On the first day, they together pumped 4500 + 3375 = 7875 gallons.   This left 18000 - 7875 = 10125 gallons.   On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of what she pumped on the first day, which is 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons.  Ms.   B pumped 1/3 as much as she pumped on the first day, which is 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons.  They pumped 3000 + 1125 = 4125 gallons on the second day.   After the second day, they pumped together 7875 + 4125 = 12000 gallons.  From 18000, it left 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.  The answer is 6000. 
[EXP] 613: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 94, [output]: 28% is the charge remaining at the end.  We need to find out what the capacity was at the beginning.  Prior to 5 hours, the power bank was losing 9% each hour.  So, after 5 hours, the power bank would have lost 5 x 9% = 45% of its capacity.  It means, the charge left would be 55%.  Then, it started to lose capacity at a rate of 7% each hour for 3 hours.  So, after 3 more hours, 3 x 7% = 21% would have been lost.  This would leave 34% of the original charge.  Since 34% is the same as 28% remaining, it means that the power bank was at 100% - 28% = 72% when Maria went to the park.  The answer is 72%. 
[EXP] 614: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Janet makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips.  So in total, she makes 10 + 15 = 25 dollars per hour.   She works 40 hours a week.   So she makes 40 * 25 = 1000 dollars a week.  In a month, she makes 4 weeks * 1000 dollars = 4000 dollars. 

20% of $10000 is 10000 * 0. 2 = 2000 dollars. 

To save the down payment, she needs to save $2000. 

She makes $4000 per month, so it would take her 2000 / 4000 = 0. 5 months to save the down payment.  The answer is 0. 
[EXP] 615: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Jamaar started with $10.  Peaches and pears cost $. 5 each, so 3 peaches + 4 pears = 7 x . 5 = $3. 5.  Kiwis cost $1 each, so 2 kiwis is 2 x 1 = $2.  Apples cost .  75 each, so 5 apples is 5 x .  75 = $3.  75.   In total, he has spent $3.  5 + $2 + $3.  75 = $9.   So he has $10 - $9 = $1 left.  Plums cost $.  25 each, so he can buy $1/.  25 = 4 plums.    The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 616: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]: 15 packs of sweets multiplied by 60 pieces in each pack gives the total number of sweets Anne has. 15 x 60 = 900.  If she kept 2 packs, that would be 2 x 60 = 120.  So she gave the rest, which is 900 - 120 = 780, to her 10 friends.  To find the number of sweets each friend received, we do 780 ÷ 10 = 78.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 617: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 138, [output]: 5% increase means that 0. 05 is added to the price.  0. 05 * 120 is 6.  After one year, the price becomes 120 + 6 = 126. 

The price increased by 5% again. 0. 05 * 126 is 6.   The new price would be 126 + 6 = 132.  After two years, the price of carrots is $132.  The price increased by 5% again. 0. 05 * 132 is 6.  The new price would be 132 + 6 = 138.  After three years, the answer is 138. 
[EXP] 618: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 45, [output]:  Olivia uploaded 72 pictures to Facebook.  She put the same number of pics into 8 albums.  72 / 8 = 9.  So she has 9 pictures in each album.  The 3 albums of selfies have 9 photos each.  So she has 3 x 9 = 27 selfies.  The 2 albums of portraits have 9 photos each.   So she has 2 x 9 = 18 portraits.   In total, she has 27 selfies and 18 portraits.  The answer is 45. 
[EXP] 619: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  James can read 3 pages in 10 minutes. 3 pages take 10 minutes.  Let's find how many groups of 3 pages are there in 18 pages. 18 ÷ 3 = 6.  So, James read 6 sets of 3 pages each.  Each set takes 10 minutes, so 6 groups take 6 x 10 = 60 minutes.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 620: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 98, [output]:  There are originally 100 guests.  24 guests leave, so there are 100 - 24 = 76 guests left.  Then, 15 guests opt for a late checkout, so they stay for a little longer, but this doesn't change the current number of guests.  In the afternoon, 2 * 15 = 30 people check in, so now there are 76 + 30 = 106 guests.  Finally, 7 more people check in after dinner, so there are now 106 + 7 = 113 guests.  The answer is 113. 
[EXP] 621: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  John started with 0 bananas and picked 4 on Wednesday. 0 + 4 = 4 bananas.  Then he picked 6 on Thursday. 4 + 6 = 10 bananas.  Then on Friday, he picked triple the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, which is 3 * 4 = 12 bananas. 10 + 12 = 22 bananas.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 622: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]: 40% of 60 is 24.  So 24 questions are easy.  The other 60 - 24 = 36 questions are not easy.  If the remaining questions are equally divided as average and difficult, then 36/2 = 18 questions are neither easy nor difficult.  18 are average and 18 are difficult. 

Aries is sure to get 75% of the easy questions. 75% of 24 is 18.  So she will get 18 out of 24 easy questions correctly.  She will also get half of the average and difficult questions (9 each).  So she will get 9 + 9 = 18 of the average and difficult questions correctly.  

In total, she will get 18 easy questions + 18 average and difficult questions = 36 questions correctly.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 623: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  We are told that Teresa sells large stuffed animals for 3 times the price of small stuffed animals.   Let's call the cost of a small stuffed animal x.   Then the cost of a large stuffed animal is 3x.  

Teresa sells twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones.  Let's say the number of small stuffed animals she sold is s and the number of large stuffed animals she sold is l.   Now we know that s = 2l.  Now, let's figure out how much she earned from these sales.  Each small stuffed animal costs 4 dollars.  So the amount she earned from selling s small stuffed animals is s x 4 = 4s.  Each large stuffed animal costs 3 times the cost of a small one, or 12 dollars.  So the amount she earned from selling l large stuffed animals is l x 12 = 12l.   In total, she earned $120.  So we can set up an equation.  4s + 12l = 120.  We know s = 2l.  So we can substitute 2l for s in the equation.  4(2l) + 12l = 120.  8l + 12l = 120.   20l = 120.   Now divide both sides by 20 and we get l = 6.  Now we can figure out how many small stuffed animals she sold.   We know s = 2l.  So s = 2(6) = 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 624: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 77, [output]: 1 week has 7 days. 7 days for the man means 7 x 5 = 35 sandwiches. 7 days for the wife means 7 x 4 = 28 sandwiches. 7 days for the son means 7 x 2 = 14 sandwiches. 35 + 28 + 14 = 77 sandwiches.  The answer is 77. 
[EXP] 625: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]:  Suzanne sold cookies for 80 * 1 = 80 dollars.  She also sold cupcakes for 60 * 4 = 240 dollars.  In total, she earned 80 + 240 = 320 dollars.  She gave her two sisters 2 * 10 = 20 dollars.  So she has 320 - 20 = 300 dollars left.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 626: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 100 eggs were initially hidden.  The Smith twins found 30 eggs each, which is 30 + 30 = 60 eggs. 100 - 60 = 40 eggs were left. 40 eggs were found by their friends, except for 10 eggs. 40 - 10 = 30.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 627: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 43200, [output]: 12 pounds per day is the original rate.  With an iron pickaxe, that is double, so 12 * 2 = 24 pounds per day.  With a steel pickaxe, that is 50% more, so 24 + (24 * 0. 5) = 36 pounds per day. 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes will mine 40 * 36 = 1440 pounds of ore in one day.  For 30 days, they will mine 1440 * 30 = 43,200 pounds of ore.  The answer is 43,200. 
[EXP] 628: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's first find the cost per sandwich in the first package.  2 sandwiches cost $3, so 1 sandwich costs $3 / 2 = $1. 50.  The second package has 4 sandwiches for $6.   So, one sandwich costs $6 / 4 = $1. 50.   This is the same price per sandwich as the first package.   The cost per sandwich is therefore $1. 50.   Now, the third package has 8 sandwiches, and we know the cost per sandwich.   To find the price of the package, we can multiply the cost per sandwich by the number of sandwiches.  8 x $1.  50 is $12.  The answer is $12. 
[EXP] 629: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 200, [output]:  Tom paid $1000 for the old bedroom set.  So the remaining balance for the new bedroom set is $3000 - $1000 = $2000.  He will have to pay a monthly 10% interest on the remaining balance.  10% of $2000 is 10/100 * 2000 = 200.  The answer is 200. 
[EXP] 630: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 25 red balloons caused 40% to burst.  So, 40% of 25 is 10, so 10 red balloons burst, leaving 25 - 10 = 15.  There are 7 green balloons that are not affected, so Sally still has 7.  Half of the 12 yellow balloons burst, so 12 / 2 = 6.  She had 12 originally, and then lost 6.  She has 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons remaining.  Now, she finds 8 blue balloons in the tree.   She adds 75% of 8 to her collection.   75% of 8 is 6, so she adds 6 blue balloons.   Her total collection now is 15 red, 7 green, 6 yellow, and 6 blue.  So, the total number of balloons she carries into the school is 15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = 34.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 631: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 24, [output]:  The way to approach this problem is to work through the probabilities step by step. 

1.  There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.  If this happens, he definitely won't have to do the homework.  So, 50% of the time he won't have to turn in his homework. 

2.   On the other hand, there's a 50% chance that the normal teacher will come in.   However, there's a 40% chance this teacher will give everyone an extension.   If this happens, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.   So, another 40% of the time, Marcus won't have to turn in his homework.  (The overlap is that the substitutions and extension probabilities are independent, so we add 40% to 50% for a total of 90% of the time that Marcus doesn't have to turn in his homework. )

3.  Of the 10% of the time Marcus has to do his homework (100% - 90% = 10%), there's a 20% chance he can convince the teacher his dog ate it and get a personal extension.  So, 2% of the time, he'll have to turn in his homework because he gets the personal extension. 

The probability of Marcus actually having to turn in his homework is then 10% - 2% = 8%.  The answer is 8%. 
[EXP] 632: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 6000 people originally.  950 seats for graduates and 300 seats for faculty leaves 6000 - 1250 = 4750 seats.  So 4750 seats are available for the guests of graduates.  To find out how many tickets each graduate would get, we need to divide 4750 by the number of graduates.  Since we don't know how many graduates there are, we can't give a final answer. 
[EXP] 633: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 450, [output]: 75 large-sized jelly beans.  Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, so he can eat 75 * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.  Since 3 small beans are equal to 1 medium-sized bean, the number of small beans is 150 * 3 = 450.  The answer is 450. 
[EXP] 634: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days. 6 x 3 = 18 hours.  She is paid $15 a day, so she earns $15 * 3 = $45.  She has to pay $3 for parking each day, so that's $3 x 3 = $9.  After expenses, she earned $45 - $9 = $36.  The total time is 18 hours, so she makes $36 / 18 = $2 per hour.  The answer is $2. 
[EXP] 635: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 66, [output]:  Ted starts with 200 dollars. 3 books for 16 dollars each is 3 * 16 = 48. 3 pencils for 6 dollars each is 3 * 6 = 18. 48 + 18 is 66.  The answer is 66. 
[EXP] 636: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 35, [output]:  If the driveway is 24 feet wide, Richard wants to put a soda bottle every 3 feet.  To find how many soda bottles he will need, divide the length of the driveway by 3:

24 feet / 3 feet per soda bottle = 8 soda bottles

To set off one fountain, it takes Richard 5 seconds.  Since he has to set off 8 fountains, multiply the number of fountains by the time it takes to set off one:

8 fountains x 5 seconds per fountain = 40 seconds

The answer is 40 seconds. 
[EXP] 637: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 1 box of apples has 40 apples. 2 boxes will have 40 x 2 = 80 apples. 80 apples divided into groups of 8 will be 80 / 8 = 10.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 638: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Amor had 50 dollars. 2 pounds of Parmesan cheese costs 2 x 11 = 22 dollars.  3 pounds of Mozzarella cheese costs 3 x 6 = 18 dollars.  In total, she has to pay 22 + 18 = 40 dollars.  After paying, she will have 50 - 40 = 10 dollars left.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 639: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the money Jim lost while in school.  His salary before going to college was 25 thousand, so 4 years of not working means he missed 4 * 25 thousand = 100 thousand.  He gets 50 thousand in loans each year, so in total he received 50 thousand * 4 = 200 thousand in loans.  So the total amount he needs to earn is 100 thousand + 200 thousand = 300 thousand. 

After college, Jim's income tripled.  If he earned 25 thousand before, he now earns 25 * 3 = 75 thousand per year.  So in order to earn 300 thousand, he needs to save 300 thousand / 75 thousand = 4 years.  The answer is 4 years. 
[EXP] 640: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 160, [output]:  Let's first find the dimensions of the fabric pieces.  The length of each piece will be 2 + 6 = 8 feet, and the width will be 2 + 8 = 10 feet.  So each piece will be 8 x 10 = 80 square feet.  Since Jim needs two pieces, he needs 2 x 80 = 160 square feet of fabric.  The answer is 160. 
[EXP] 641: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 736, [output]:  Let's first find out how many letters they delivered on Tuesday.  One-fifth of 425 is 425 / 5 = 85.  17 more than that is 85 + 17 = 102.  They delivered 102 letters on Tuesday. 

For Wednesday, we need to find out how many they delivered on Tuesday first.  Twice as many as Tuesday is 2 x 102 = 204.   5 more than that is 204 + 5 = 209.  They delivered 209 letters on Wednesday. 

In total, they delivered 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday.  The answer is 736. 
[EXP] 642: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 101, [output]: 10 people want the chicken salad, which is $6. 5 0 per person.  So that will cost 10 x $ 6. 50 = $65. 6 people want the pasta salad, which is $6 per person.   So that will cost 6 x $ 6 = $36.   To find the total cost, add the two amounts: $65 + $36 = $101.  The answer is $101. 
[EXP] 643: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1.  On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5. 
2.   On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.  So, the amount lost in the first race is $5.  Twice that would be 2 x $5 = $10, and $1 more than that would be $10 + $1 = $11.  So, he won $11 in the second race.  (He didn't lose anything, actually.  He won.  But for this question, we are going to treat it as if he had lost a minus number, even though it's really a plus. )
3.    On the third race, he lost 1. 5 times as much as he won in the second race.   This is where we really lose him, because we have to lose something, and lose is a negative number… in tune with losing.   We know he won $11 on the second race.  So, losing 1. 5 times as much would be 1. 5 x $11 = $16.   5 So, he lost $16 on the third race. 
4.   Now let's track everything together.    On the first race, he lost $5.   On the second race, he won $11.  On the third race, he lost $16.    If he lost $5 to start with, and won $11, and then lost $16, his losses stand out. 
[EXP] 644: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 130000, [output]:  If there are 5 cities in each of 26 countries, then there are a total of 5 * 26 = 130 cities.  Since each city has 1000 people, then there are 130 * 1000 = 130000 people in all the cities.   The answer is 130000. 
[EXP] 645: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]: 1st, we need to find out what Cole and Xavier's heights are now. 
Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. 1 foot is 12 inches, so 4 feet is 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 48 inches plus 3 inches is 51 inches.  Xavier is now 51 inches tall. 

Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer.  50 inches plus 2 inches is 52 inches.  Cole is now 52 inches tall. 

Now we need to find the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now.  Xavier is 51 inches tall, and Cole is 52 inches tall.  The difference is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.  The answer is 1 inch. 
[EXP] 646: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 420, [output]: 1920 dollars were shared among 3 people.  We'll call the share of the first person "x".  The second person took $80 more than the first, so the second took x + 80.  The third person took twice what the second took, so the third took 2(x + 80).   The total taken by the three should equal the total amount, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920.  Let's combine like terms: 4x + 240 = 1920.  Subtract 240 from both sides: 4x = 1680.   Divide both sides by 4: x = 420.  The answer is 420.

2.  They painted for 3 weeks.  So there are 3 * 7 = 21 days. 21 days.  
3.  In a day, they work 3/8ths of a day.  
4.  How many hours is 3/8ths of a day?  1 day has 24 hours.  1/8 of a day is 24 / 8 = 3 hours.  3/8 is three times that, so 9 hours.  So in one day, they work 9 hours.   
5.   3 weeks have 21 days.  In each day, the painters work 9 hours.  
6.   So in total they worked 21 * 9 hours = 189 hours.  
7.   They are a team of 4 painters.  To find out how many hours each painter worked, we divide 189 by 4.  189 / 4 = 47.  The answer is 47 hours. 
[EXP] 648: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]:  Let's start by letting x be the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.  Since Rory retrieved four more balls in the first set, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4.  He retrieved half as many balls in the third set as in the second, so the number of balls retrieved in the third set is x/2. 

The total number of balls retrieved is 19, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x/2) = 19

Combine like terms:

2x + 4 + x/2 = 19

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

4x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide by 5:

x = 6

Now we know that x, the number of balls retrieved in the second set, is 6.  The number of balls retrieved in the first set is x + 4, which is 6 + 4 = 10.   The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 649: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7400, [output]: 2007: 20000
2010: ?.  Since the car depreciates 21% per year, that is 20000 * . 21% = 4200 in 2008. 20000 - 4200 = 15800.  In 2009, the car depreciates another 21%.  15800 * 21% = 3334.  15800 - 3334 = 12466.  Finally, in 2010, the car depreciates by 21% again.  12466 * 21% = 2614.  12466 - 2614 = 9852.  The car's price in 2010 is 9852.  The answer is 9852. 
[EXP] 650: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  There are originally 50 books.  Half of them are written in English, which is 50 / 2 = 25. 10% of 50 is 50 * 0. 1 = 5.  So 25 English books and 5 German books make 30 books.  50 - 30 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 651: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 655, [output]: 1955 is the total distance from San Diego to New York City. 325 is the distance Bernice drove for each of 4 days.  So the total distance she drove is 325 x 4 = 1300 kilometers.  The distance left to drive is the total distance minus the distance already driven. 1955 - 1300 = 655.  The answer is 655. 
[EXP] 652: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Ingrid drinks 8 cups in a day. 30 days will be 8 * 30 = 240 cups. 240 cups is 240/16 = 15 gallons.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 653: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 110, [output]:  Romeo started with 120 people on the train.  At the first stop, 20 more people boarded the train.  So the number of people on the train is now 120 + 20 = 140. 

At the second stop, 50 people descended from the train (worded oddly, but just subtract).  Then 2 times that number (50 x 2 = 100) boarded the train.  So the number of people on the train is now 140 - 50 + 100 = 190.  190 people on the train.  At the third stop, 80 people descended from the train.  Therefore, the total number of people on the train at the final stop is 190 - 80 = 110.  The answer is 110. 
[EXP] 654: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 55, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step!

1.  The tank top cost $10. 
2.  Running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top.  So they cost $10 + $5 = $15.  In total, the top and shorts cost  $10 + $15 = $25. 
3.   Tennis shoes were on sale for half price.   If they were originally $48, then half of that is 48 / 2 = 24.   So they cost $24. 
4.  Athletic socks were originally $8 and had a $2 coupon.  $8 - 2 = 6.  So she paid $6 for the athletic socks.  
5.   To get the total, we add the costs of all four items: 
$10 (tank top) + $15 (shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (socks) = $55.  The answer is 55. 
[EXP] 655: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]:  First, find the number of tiles needed.  The area of the kitchen floor is 200 sq ft.  Since the tiles are square, each side is 1ft, so the area of each tile is 1 x 1 = 1 sq ft.  To find the number of tiles, divide the area of the kitchen floor by the area of each tile: 200 sq ft / 1 sq ft = 200 tiles.  Now, to find the cost, multiply the number of tiles by the cost of each tile: 200 x 12 = 2400.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 656: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2304, [output]:  James had an accident and insurance was 60% more than normal.  So the cost is 120 * (1 + 0. 6) = 192.  That is $192 a month.  If he pays that for 12 months, it will be 12 * 192 = 2304.  The answer is 2304. 
[EXP] 657: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 156, [output]:  Let's break it down week by week. 4 twin beds and 1 king bed means 1 + 4/2 = 3 loads of laundry per week.  There are 52 weeks in a year, so Greg does 52 * 3 = 156 loads of laundry in a year.  The answer is 156. 
[EXP] 658: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. 4 movies every Saturday means 4 movies per week.  They watch half the number of movies on Sunday as on Saturday.  Half of 4 is 2.  So they watch 2 movies on Sunday.  Let's figure out how many movies they watch in a week.  4 movies on Saturday and 2 movies on Sunday means they watch 6 movies in a week.  If they watch movies every weekend, that's 6 movies per week.  Now, we need to multiply the number of movies per week by the number of weeks.  The question asks about 4 weeks, so we need to multiply 6 movies per week by 4 weeks.  6 x 4 = 24.   The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 659: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 250, [output]: 2 years ago, Leo had 100 stickers. 1 year ago, he had 100 + 50 = 150 stickers.  This year, he collected twice the number of stickers as the previous year, which is 2 * 50 = 100 stickers.  So this year, he had 150 + 100 = 250 stickers.  The answer is 250. 
[EXP] 660: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 3 cats, each fed 2 times a day with 60 grams of cat food, means 3 x 2 x 60 = 360 grams of cat food per day. 720 grams of cat food will last for 720 divided by 360 = 2 days.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 661: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Becky ate 10 slices.  Since Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake, Jake must have eaten 10 - 3 = 7 slices.  Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake, so she must have eaten 7 * 2 = 14 slices. 

In total, they ate 10 + 7 + 14 = 31 slices.  The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 662: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 58, [output]:  Let's say Donovan's part took x minutes.  Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took x + 18 minutes.  Since they made the meal together, the total time taken is the sum of the time taken by both of them, which is x + (x + 18) = 98.  Combining like terms, we get 2x + 18 = 98.  Subtracting 18 from both sides, we get 2x = 80.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40.   So Donovan's part took 40 minutes.  Since Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer, Betsy's part took 40 + 18 = 58 minutes.   The answer is 58. 
[EXP] 663: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 482, [output]:  Hannah had to pay for the cast, 30-minute visit, painkillers, and parking. 

The cast cost $200. 

The doctor's 30-minute visit is 1/2 hour, so that will be 1/2 x $300 = $150. 30 painkillers for $4 each will be 30 x 4 = 120. 2 hours of parking is 2 x $6 = 12. 

Therefore, the total cost of the doctor's visit is 200 + 150 + 120 + 12. 200 + 150 is 350. 350 + 120 is 470.  470 + 12 is 482.  The answer is 482. 
[EXP] 664: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 320, [output]:  James gets 80 emails a day, so in a 5-day work week, he gets 80 * 5 = 400 emails. 20% of the emails don't require response, so 20/100 * 400 = 80 emails don't require response. 400 - 80 = 320 emails require a response.  The answer is 320. 
[EXP] 665: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 247, [output]: 32 classes visited on Monday.  On Tuesday, twice as many visited (2 x 32 = 64).  On Wednesday, three times as many visited (3 x 32 = 96).  On Thursday, 30 classes visited.  On Friday, 25 classes visited.  In total, the number of classes that visited is 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25. 32 + 64 = 96, and 96 + 96 = 192, and 192 + 30 = 222, and 222 + 25 = 247.  The answer is 247. 
[EXP] 666: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 95, [output]:  We'll start by adding up John's scores.  He scored 100 on each of the first 3 tests, so that's 3 x 100 = 300.  Then he scored an 80 on his 4th test, so we add that to the total: 300 + 80 = 380.  The total number of tests he took was 4, so we divide by 4 to find the average.  380 divided by 4 is 95.  The answer is 95. 
[EXP] 667: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 20 pizzas were ordered by the glee club.  70% of 20 is 20 x (7/10) = 14 pizzas.  The glee club ate 14 pizzas, leaving them with 20 - 14 = 6 pizzas. 

The football team ordered 2 x 20 = 40 pizzas.  80% of 40 is 40 x (8/10) = 32 pizzas.   They ate 32 pizzas, leaving them with 40 - 32 = 8 pizzas.  In total, there are 6 + 8 = 14 pizzas left.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 668: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 245, [output]: 700 small coupons are to be sent.  Twice as many big coupons will be sent, so that is 2 * 700 = 1400 big coupons.  Since small coupons cost 5 cents each and big coupons cost 15 cents each, the total cost in cents is 700 * 5 + 1400 * 15.  This is 3500 + 21000 = 24500.  To find the total cost in dollars, divide by 100, as there are 100 cents in a dollar.  24500 / 100 = 245.  The answer is 245. 
[EXP] 669: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Sidney ordered 3 less than 10 meatball sub sandwiches.  3 less than 10 is 7.  So Sidney ordered 7 meatball sub sandwiches.  Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.  7 x 4 = 28 meatballs from the first order.  Mark ate 4 of those sandwiches, so 4 x 4 = 16 meatballs were eaten.  28 - 16 is 12.   Sidney ordered 3 more sub sandwiches.  Those will have 3 x 4 = 12 meatballs.   12 + 12 = 24.  So there are 24 meatballs left.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 670: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]: 20 trucks were dispatched, each carrying 20 tons of fertiliser.  So initially, the total number of tons of fertiliser is 20 * 20 = 400 tons.  A quarter of the trucks did not deliver fertiliser, which is 20 * 1/4 = 5 trucks.  That means 20 - 5 = 15 trucks did deliver fertiliser.  Each truck carried 20 tons of fertiliser, so the total tons delivered is 15 * 20 = 300 tons.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 671: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Dennis needs 6 pounds of butter to make 6 dozen croissants.  The cost of one pound of butter is $4.  Since he needs 6 pounds, the cost will be 6 * 4 = 24 dollars.   However, he is getting a half off from the buy one get one half off promotion, so 3 of the pounds will be half off.  The half price is 4 / 2 = 2. 3 pounds at half price will be 3 * 2 = 6.  24 - 6 = 18.   So Dennis will have to pay $18 for 6 pounds of butter.  The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 672: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 251, [output]: 1.  First, find the total number of people attending the party. 25 + 7 + 13 = 45. 4 people are not attending, so the total number of people is 45 - 4 = 41. 

2.  Calculate the base fee: 20 people is the base number, so the base fee is $125. 

3.  Calculate the additional people: 41 - 20 = 21 people are additional.  Each additional person costs $6, so the total cost for additional people is $6 * 21 = $126.  Add this to the base fee: $125 + $126 = $251.  The answer is $251. 
[EXP] 673: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 85, [output]:  Let's start with Maggie.  She had 60 dollars and spent a quarter of it.  This means she spent $\frac{1}{4}$ * 60 = 15 dollars.  So she has 60 - 15 = 45 dollars left.  The same logic goes for Riza: she spent a third of her 60 dollars, which is $\frac{1}{3}$ * 60 = 20 dollars.  So she has 60 - 20 = 40 dollars left.  In total, they have 45 + 40 = 85 dollars left.  The answer is 85. 
[EXP] 674: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Let's first find out how many bananas the first monkey eats.  It eats 10 bananas a day.  The second monkey eats 4 more than the first, so it eats 10 + 4 = 14 bananas a day.  Together, the first two monkeys eat 10 + 14 = 24 bananas a day.  There are 315 bananas altogether, so it is enough for 315 / 7 days = 45 bananas a day.  The third monkey eats the rest, so it eats 45 - 24 = 21 bananas a day.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 675: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]:  Teddy started with half of the pieces of the first 500-piece puzzle.   500/2 = 250.  So he placed 250 pieces of that puzzle.  After that, he placed all the pieces of the second 500-piece puzzle.  So in total, he placed 250 + 500 = 750.  The answer is 750. 
[EXP] 676: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]: 1st, find out how much Jenny spends. 15 roses means she will buy 2 x 15 = 30, but there's an option for a dozen roses for 15 dollars.  So she decided to buy 12 more.  She bought in total 12 + 3 = 15 roses. 

Jenny paid with 5 5-dollar bills.  If she arrives with 5 5-dollar bills, she has 5 x 5 = 25 dollars.  After buying the roses, see how much is left over.  Roses cost 30 dollars but you know it's actually 25.  So she spent 25 dollars.  She has 25 - 30 = -5 dollars left. 

To solve this problem, need to know how many quarters makes a dollar. 1 dollar = 4 quarters.  -5 dollars = -5 x 4 = -20 quarters.   The answer is -20 quarters.

[EXP] 678: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 145, [output]: 1st train arrives in 10 minutes, and stays for 20 minutes, so it leaves at 30 minutes.  The 2nd train arrives half an hour after the 1st train : 30 + 30 = 60.  It stays in the station a quarter of the time the 1st train stayed, i.  e. , 5 minutes.   So the 2nd train leaves at 65 minutes.  The 3rd train arrives 1 hour later : 65 + 60 = 125.   It leaves immediately after it arrives, at 125 min.  The 4th train arrives 20 minutes after the 3rd train, so at 125 + 20 = 145 min.   Paul will get on this train at 145 min.    So, Paul will wait for 145 - 10 = 135 minutes.  The answer is 135. 
[EXP] 679: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Melanie started with 0 toothpicks and saved 10 each week for 12 weeks. 10 x 12 = 120 toothpicks. 200 - 120 = 80 toothpicks left to collect. 80 / 10 = 8 weeks.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 680: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 1.  Mr.  Rogers bought the watch at 75% of its original price, so he paid 2000 * 0. 75 = 1500 dollars. 

2.  Then he sold it to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it, so his friend paid 1500 * 1. 2 = 1800 dollars. 

3.  So the discount his friend got is (2000 - 1800) / 2000 = (200 / 2000) = 1/10 = 10%.  The answer is 10%.

[EXP] 682: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 195, [output]:  Frankie's score is 15 more than twice as high as Binkie's score.  Since Binkie bowled a score of 90, twice as high as Binkie's score would be 90 x 2 = 180.  Frankie's score is 15 more than that, so Frankie's score is 180 + 15 = 195.  The answer is 195. 
[EXP] 683: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  James walked 4 miles to the store, but then he turned back around and walked 4 miles back home.  So he actually walked a total distance of 4 + 4 = 8 miles.  His walking speed is 4 miles per hour.   To find the time it took him, we need to divide the distance he walked by his speed. 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.   The answer is 2 hours.

She bought 10 bunches for 3 dollars each, so that's 10 * 3 = 30 dollars.  If she buys the bananas individually for 0. 80 each, that would be 40 * 0. 80 = 32 dollars.   She spends 30 dollars instead of 32, so she saves 32 - 30 = 2 dollars.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 685: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Sam will get x feet and Harry will get x + 60 feet.  They have a total of 100 feet of fence.  So x + (x + 60) = 100.  x + x + 60 = 100.  2x + 60 = 100.   2x = 100 - 60 = 40.   x = 40 / 2 = 20.   So Sam gets 20 feet and Harry gets 20 + 60 = 80 feet.  There is a total of 80 + 20 = 100 feet of fence.  So, Sam gets 20 feet and none is left over.  The answer is 0. 
[EXP] 686: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]: 8 inches per 4 years. 8 / 4 = 2 inches per year. 2 inches per year for 13 years will be 2 * 13 = 26 inches.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 687: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 131250, [output]:  Since Marcel sold half of the total bikes as trekking bikes, that is 300 / 2 = 150.  He sold 15% as BMX bikes, which is 300 x 0. 15 = 45 BMX bikes.   That leaves 300 - (150 + 45) = 105 remaining bikes, which must be MTB bikes.   Now, let's calculate the total amount earned:
- 150 Trekking bikes at $450 each is 150 x 450 = 67,500
- 45 BMX bikes at $250 each is 45 x 250 = 11,250
- 105 MTB bikes at $500 each is 105 x 500 = 52,500
The total amount earned is the sum of the three: 67,500 + 11,250 + 52,500 = 131,250.  Therefore the answer is 131,250.

The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 689: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  Normal student has 6 periods a day.  John has 2 extra classes so he has 6 + 2 = 8 periods.   Each period is 40 minutes long.   So, 8 x 40 = 320 minutes per day. 

2.   John goes to school 5 days a week.   So, 320 minutes x 5 = 1600 minutes per week.  This is the total minutes spent on his regular classes.  He has the weekend.  On the weekend he spends 1/16 of the weekly minutes as extra learning time.   A total of 1600 + 1600/16 = 1600 + 100 = 1700 minutes.   That is the total number of minutes spent on classes. 

3.    There are 60 minutes in an hour.   1700 minutes divided by 60 is 28.  The answer is 28.

[EXP] 691: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Let's find the height of each child in inches.  The first child is 6 feet tall, so we need to convert this to inches. 1 foot is 12 inches, so 6 feet is 6 x 12 = 72 inches.  The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child, so it is 72 + 2 = 74 inches.  The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child, so it is 74 - 5 = 69 inches.  The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child, so it is 69 + 3 = 72 inches.  So, the height of the fourth child is 72 inches.  The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 692: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1000, [output]: 2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags. 200 bags at $5 per bag is 200 x $5 = $1000.  The answer is 1000. 
[EXP] 693: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1080, [output]:  A Tyrannosaurus rex ate half of the triceratops first.  This means half of the original amount is left.  Then, the velociraptors took half of what was left, which is a quarter of the original amount.  Then, the Allosaurus ate the last quarter, so the original amount is 4 times the amount the Allosaurus ate.  The Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, so the original amount is 4 * 270 = 1080 kilograms.  The answer is 1080. 
[EXP] 694: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 144, [output]:  To find the total area of the four walls, we need to calculate the area of each wall separately and add them up.  For the north and south walls, the area is 10 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 80 square feet.  Since there are two north and south walls, the total area of these walls is 80 * 2 = 160 square feet.  For the east and west walls, the area is 5 x 8 feet, so each wall has an area of 40 square feet.   Since there are two east and west walls, the total area of these walls is 40 * 2 = 80 square feet.  In total, the four walls have an area of 160 + 80 = 240 square feet.  Since a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, we divide the total area by 20 to find how many gallons are needed: 240 / 20 = 12.  Since each gallon of paint costs 12 dollars, we multiply the number of gallons needed by 12 to get the total cost: 12 * 12 = 144.  The answer is 144. 
[EXP] 695: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Ellen started with 12 sodas. 3 were shaken up, so 9 were unshaken.  She took one unshaken soda, leaving 9 - 1 = 8 unshaken and 3 shaken.  Her brother took 1 shaken soda, leaving 3 - 1 = 2 shaken and 8 unshaken.  He also took 2 unshaken, leaving 8 - 2 = 6 unshaken and 2 shaken.   Ellen's friend saw 2 shaken sodas and 6 unshaken sodas.  Ellen's friend would get sprayed by a shaken soda from a can with a probability of 2/(2 + 6) = 2/8 = 1/4 = 25%.  The answer is 25%. 
[EXP] 696: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 270, [output]:  The first train travels 60 miles per hour.  The second train travels half of that, so 60 / 2 = 30 miles per hour.  

Let's calculate how much distance each train has traveled: 
The first train travels 3 hours at 60 miles per hour.  So it travels 3 * 60 = 180 miles. 
The second train travels 3 hours at 30 miles per hour.  So it travels 3 * 30 = 90 miles.  

Now we need to find the total distance between the two trains.   To do that, we subtract the distance the second train has traveled from the total distance the first train has traveled.   So the distance between the two trains is 180 - 90 = 90 miles.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 697: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Billy is helping 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day.  So, he helps 2 x 3 = 6 people each day.  

March has 31 days and April has 19 days.  31 + 19 = 50 days.  20% of these days are off, so he doesn't help on 20% * 50 = 10 days.  That's 50 - 10 = 40 days he will help people.  So, he will help people on 40 days.  For each day, he helps 6 people, so for 40 days, he will help 6 * 40 = 240 people.   The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 698: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 480, [output]:  There were originally 20 private cars and 12 buses.  After the ceremony, each bus carried 35 people and each car carried 3 people.  We can start by calculating how many people were in the buses: 12 buses, each carrying 35 people, is 12 * 35 = 420 people.  Next, we can calculate how many people were in the cars: 20 cars, each carrying 3 people, is 20 * 3 = 60 people.  To find the total number of people inside the church, we add the people from the buses and the people from the cars: 420 + 60 = 480.  The answer is 480. 
[EXP] 699: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  Let's start by finding the age of Martha.  Since Mike is 24 and Martha is 4 years younger, Martha must be 24 - 4 = 20 years old.  Jeff is 10 years older than Martha, so Jeff must be 20 + 10 = 30 years old.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 700: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start by finding how long it takes to ride each slide.  The 300 foot slide will take 300/60 minutes = 5 minutes to ride.  The 240 foot slide will take 240/80 minutes = 3 minutes to ride.   To find the difference, subtract the times: 5 - 3 = 2.  It takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide.  The answer is 2 minutes. 
[EXP] 701: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Bobby takes 30 minutes for lunch and 2 x 15 minutes = 30 minutes for breaks per day. 30 + 30 = 60 minutes per day.  After 5 days, he took 60 x 5 = 300 minutes.  We convert 300 minutes to hours. 300 minutes divided by 60 is 5 hours.  So, in total, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours after 5 days.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 702: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 16, [output]: 1st step: Let's find out how far micah ran.  Micah ran 3. 5 times what Amber ran.   Amber ran 8 miles so 3. 5 times 8 is 24.  24 miles. 

2nd step: Now we know Amber ran 8 miles and Micah ran 24.  Together, they ran 8 + 24 miles.  That's 32 miles. 

3rd step: 52 miles were ran in total.   So we subtract 32 from 52 to see how many miles Ahito ran.  52 - 32 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 703: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 113, [output]:  Sheila originally charged 85 dollars.  After returning 15 dollars, she had 85 - 15 = 70 dollars left.  

She bought a frying pan for 20% off 20 dollars.  If it was on sale, then it actually cost 20 - 20% * 20 = 20 - 4 = 16 dollars.   She also bought a set of towels for 10% off 30 dollars.   So the towels actually cost 30 - 3 = 27 dollars.  A total of 16 + 27 = 43 dollars were charged.  So 70 + 43 is 113.  The answer is 113. 
[EXP] 704: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

1.  A fifth of the jellyfish are large.  So, suppose there are 5k jellyfish for some number k.  Then 5k/5 = k of the jellyfish are large. 

2.   A third of the large jellyfish change color to blue.  So, out of k jellyfish, a third of k jellyfish change color.  So, (1/3)k of the jellyfish change color. 

3.    But we know that 6 jellyfish change color under UV light.   So, (1/3)k = 6, or k = 18.   

4.    We want to know the total number of jellyfish, which is 5k.  Since k = 18, we get 5 * 18 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 705: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  CHris is 4 years old.  Ben is 2 times Chris, so Ben is 2 x 4 = 8 years old.  Caroline is 3 times Ben, so Caroline is 3 x 8 = 24 years old.   The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 706: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40, [output]: 20% of 100,000 is 0. 20 * 100,000 is 20,000.  So each year Lauren saves 20,000.  For 20 years, she will save 20,000 * 20 = 400,000.  Lauren is planning to live off 40% of her salary, so she will need 40% * 100,000 = 40,000 dollars each year.  Her retirement budget will be 40,000 * 20 = 800,000.  So Lauren needs 800,000 - 400,000 = 400,000 more dollars.  Since she earns 20,000 a year, she will need to work for 400,000 / 20,000 = 20 years.  She already planned to work 20 years for retirement.  It will take her no more years.  The answer is she does not need more years to work. 
[EXP] 707: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 100 centimeters must be cut into 4 equal parts, so each part will be 100 / 4 = 25 centimeters long. 25 centimeters will then be divided into 5 equal parts, so each final cut will be 25 / 5 = 5 centimeters long.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 708: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 360, [output]: 240 is 40% of the total population. 40% is equal to 4/10.  So the total population is 240 / (4/10) = 240 x 10/4 = 600. 600 is the total population. 240 is 40% of the total population, leaving 60% for girls. 600 * 60/100 = 360.  The answer is 360. 
[EXP] 709: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]: 19 + 26 is 45.  Then she used a coupon for 7 dollars, so she spent 45 - 7 = 38.  The answer is 38. 
[EXP] 710: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]: 3 women are wearing 4 inch heels, so 3 x 4 = 12. 3 women are wearing 2 inch heels, so 3 x 2 = 6.  The total height of heels is 12 + 6 = 18.  To find the average, you divide by the number of women. 18 divided by 6 is 3.  The answer is 3 inches. 
[EXP] 711: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 9,300 miles need to be covered in a month. 9,300 / 30 days = 310 miles need to be covered each day. 125 times 2 (twice a day) is 250. 310 - 250 is 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 712: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 157, [output]:  Let's find the total number of balls first:

The cost of the balls is:
Red balls: 3 x 9 = 27
Blue balls: 11 x 5 = 55
Green balls: 25 x 3 = 75
Total cost = 27 + 55 + 75 = 157

The store will receive 157 dollars after all the balls are sold.  The answer is 157. 
[EXP] 713: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 12 kg of apples were bought. 1/4 of that is 12/4 = 3. 1/3 of that is 12/3 = 4.  Peter and Paul will take 3 + 4 = 7 kg. 12 - 7 is 5.  James will have 5 kg left.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 714: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: -3, [output]:  The temperature started at 2 degrees Celsius.  Then it dropped 8 degrees Celsius, so it became 2 - 8 = -6 degrees Celsius.  Then it increased 3 degrees Celsius.  So it became -6 + 3 = -3 degrees Celsius in the morning.  The answer is -3. 
[EXP] 715: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Raymond starts with 21 dollars.  He then saves 11 dollars from his allowance, so he has 21 + 11 = 32 dollars.  Then he spends 5 dollars on a comic book, leaving him with 32 - 5 = 27 dollars.  Then he spends 19 dollars on a puzzle, leaving him with 27 - 19 = 8 dollars.   The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 716: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Anna started with $16.  She has already spent $4, so she has 16 - 4 = 12 dollars left.  After buying 2 books and having $2 left, each book must have cost 12 / 2 = 6 dollars.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 717: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Last year there were 50 students.  This year, the enrollment increased by 20%.  20% of 50 is 10, so 50 + 10 = 60 students.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 718: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Let's find the number of blinks per minute. 255 blinks in 5 minutes means 255 / 5 = 51 blinks per minute.  To find out how many minutes it'll take to blink 459 times, we'll divide 459 by 51: 459 / 51 = 9.  The answer is 9 minutes. 
[EXP] 719: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Let’s begin by calculating the total number of male and female fish Tate has originally. 
	* Male guppies: 4
	* Male goldfishes: 3
	Total male fish: 4 + 3 = 7
	* Female guppies: 7
	* Female goldfishes: 5
	Total female fish: 7 + 5 = 12
After buying fish, the numbers change. 
	* Male guppies: 4 + 2 = 6
	* Female guppies: 7 + 1 = 8
	* Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = 5
	* Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = 8
The new total number of male fish is 6 + 5 = 11, and the new total number of female fish is 8 + 8 = 16.  To find the difference between female and male fish, we subtract the number of male fish from the number of female fish.   16 - 11 is 5.  So, Tate has 5 more female fish than male fish.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 720: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 18, [output]:  Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.  Megan took 2 hours longer, so she took 4 + 2 = 6 hours to walk the dog.   Dior took over 4 hours longer than Amalia, so Dior took 4 + 4 = 8 hours to do laundry. 

To find the total time, we add up the time taken by each person:
4 + 6 + 8 = 18 hours

The answer is 18. 
[EXP] 721: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 560, [output]:  John makes two round trips a month, so one trip will be twice the driving time.  Each round trip he drives for 4 hours.  At a speed of 70 mph, the distance driven for one round trip will be 4 hours x 70 mph = 280 miles.  For two round trips, the distance will be 2 x 280 = 560 miles.  The answer is 560. 
[EXP] 722: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]: 10 x 7 = 70 miles is how far Sofie will walk in 7 days.  Since Brian walks half as far as Sofie, he will walk 70 / 2 = 35 miles.  The answer is 35. 
[EXP] 723: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 18, [output]: 5 workers are available to work on the order.  2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour each, so 2 x 6 = 12 toys an hour.  Another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour each, so 2 x 4 = 8 toys an hour.  In total, they produce 12 + 8 = 20 toys an hour.  For 10 hours, they produce 20 * 10 = 200 toys.  The order needs 400 toys total, but they still need 20 more after finishing their 10 hours, so they produced 400 - 20 = 380 toys.  Therefore, the fifth worker must have produced 400 - 380 = 20 toys in those 10 hours.  So the fifth worker produces 20 / 10 = 2 toys an hour.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 724: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 105, [output]:  Elijah has 2 dogs. 1 dog is 1/4 the weight of Kory's dog, so that is 60/4 = 15 pounds. 1 dog is 1/2 the weight of Kory's dog so that is 60/2 = 30 pounds.  Elijah's two dogs weigh 15 + 30 = 45 pounds.  In total, Elijah's dogs and Kory's dog weigh 45 + 60 = 105 pounds.  The answer is 105. 
[EXP] 725: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis.  That means Luis got half of Seth's stickers.  Let's represent Seth's original stickers as x.  So Luis got x/2 stickers. 

Luis used half of the stickers, leaves 1/2x/2 = x/4 left.  Then Luis gave the rest to Kris, so Kris got x/2 - x/4 = x/4 stickers.  Then Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 to Rob.  Kris had x/4 stickers initially, so after giving 7, he had x/4 - 7 = 9.  This means 9 = x/4 - 7.  Add 7 on both sides, we get 16 = x/4.  Multiply both sides by 4, we get 64 = x.  So the answer is 64. 
[EXP] 726: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many M&M John has in total.  Each 1 ounce of M&M has 30 M&M, so 10 ounces has 10 x 30 = 300 M&M.  He buys 3 bags, so he has 10 x 3 = 30 ounces.  So he has 30 x 30 = 900 M&M total.   He will put 10 M&M in each small bag.  So the number of small bags he can make is 900/10 = 90.  The answer is 90. 
[EXP] 727: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Alfie flies 400 kilometers per day.  Half of the way around the earth is 40,000 / 2 = 20,000 kilometers. 20,000 kilometers divided by 400 kilometers per day is 20,000 / 400 = 50.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 728: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 750, [output]:  This problem is a bit complicated, so let's break it down step by step.  We are told that the fastest car is 1. 25 times the speed of the second fastest car.  We are also told that the second fastest car is 5 times the speed of the average car.   The average car can go 120 miles per hour. 

We can start by finding the speed of the second fastest car.   The second fastest car is 5 times the speed of the average car.   So the second fastest car can go 5 x 120 = 600 miles per hour. 

Now we can find the speed of the fastest car.  The fastest car is 1. 25 times the speed of the second fastest car.  This means it can go 1. 25 x 600 miles per hour.  Multiplying 1. 25 and 600, we get 750 miles per hour.  The answer is 750. 
[EXP] 729: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 2 years ago Liam was 16 - 2 = 14 years old. 2 years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince, so Vince must have been 14 / 2 = 7 years old. 2 years have passed, so now Vince is 7 + 2 = 9 years old.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 730: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  We know there were a total of 56 eggs painted.   We also know that Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs.   Additionally, Camden is 12 more than Sarah, so if we let Sarah's count be x, then Camden's count is x + 12.    Since they painted 30 eggs together, we can set up the equation x + (x + 12) = 30, which simplifies to 2x + 12 = 30.   Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 2x = 18.   Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 9.  This means Sarah painted 9 eggs and Camden painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.   Since Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, let's call this number y.  We know that Arnold and Madeline's count, together with Camden and Sarah's count, equal 56.  So, we can set up the equation y + y + 9 + 21 = 56.  Combining like terms, we get 2y + 30 = 56.  Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2y = 26.  Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 13.   This means Arnold and Madeline painted 13 eggs each.    Since Camden painted 21 eggs and Arnold painted 13, Camden painted 8 more than Arnold.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 731: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]:  Nik has 200 crayons.  He puts them into boxes of 8 crayons each.  200 / 8 = 25.  So he needs 25 boxes.  Each box weighs 8 ounces, and contains 8 crayons.  Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.  So each box weighs the crayons in it plus the box itself, which is 8 + 8 = 16 ounces.  So the total weight of all the crayons and boxes is 16 x 25 = 400 ounces.  There are 16 ounces to a pound, so 400 / 16 = 25 pounds total.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 732: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 96, [output]: 80% of 80 feet is 0. 8 x 80 = 64.  So he can make logs out of 64 feet.  If he cuts it into 4-foot logs, that's 64 / 4 = 16 logs.  From each log, he can make 5 planks.  So that's 16 x 5 = 80 planks.  He sells each plank for $1. 2.  So he makes a total of 1. 2 x 80 = $96.  The answer is 96. 
[EXP] 733: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 45000, [output]:  Let's first find out what Valerie's brother earns.  We know Valerie earns $5000.  Since Valerie earns half of her brother's salary, that means her brother earns twice that.  $5000 * 2 = $10,000.   So Valerie's brother earns $10,000.  Together, they earn $5000 + $10,000 = $15,000.  Their mother earns twice as much as them, so she earns $15,000 * 2 = $30,000.  So in total, they have $15,000 + $30,000 = $45,000.  The answer is $45,000. 
[EXP] 734: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Since Grandma walks 3 miles, and 2 of those miles are on the beach, she spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.  This is the same as saying that it takes her 40 minutes to walk 2 miles on the beach. 

Since she walks at a constant speed on the beach, this means that it takes her 20 minutes to walk 1 mile on the beach.  The remaining 1 mile is on the sidewalk, where she walks twice as fast as on the beach.  This means it takes her 20/2 = 10 minutes to walk 1 mile on the sidewalk.  In total, it takes her 40 + 10 = 50 minutes to complete the 3-mile walk.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 735: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Jane originally saved 4 x 8 = 32 dollars. 60 - 32 = 28.  To save 28 more dollars, it will take her 28 / 4 = 7 more weeks.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 736: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]: 3 trees had 7 blue birds each.  7 * 3 = 21 blue birds.  Then 2 other trees had 4 blue birds each, for a total of 8 birds.  So there were 21 + 8 = 29 blue birds so far.  Then there was 1 tree with 3 blue birds.  29 + 3 = 32.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 737: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 26, [output]:  Let's first find out how many marbles Bob had originally.  If he received 2 dozen more marbles to have a total of 60 marbles, then the 2 dozen marbles are 2 x 12 = 24 marbles.  So he had 60 - 24 = 36 marbles initially.  After losing 10 marbles, he will be left with 36 - 10 = 26 marbles.  The answer is 26. 
[EXP] 738: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 68, [output]:  Donny has 2 mugs of water.  One mug is 33 degrees.  He pours 4 ounces from this mug into his water bottle.  That leaves 16 ounces in the 33-degree mug.  If the other mug is unknown, then its initial amount of water is "x" ounces and its temperature is unknown.  When he pours one ounce from this mug into his water bottle, this mug is left with "x-1" ounces.  Since he is now able to drink the water (it is at least 40 degrees), the total water in the two mugs is now at least 40 ounces.  We can set up the following equation:

16 + x - 1 >= 40

Since we don't know x, we can subtract 16 and -1 from all sides of the inequality:

x - 17 >= 24

We can add 17 to all sides to get:

x >= 41

So the second bottle must at least be 41 degrees.  The answer is 41. 
[EXP] 739: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 700, [output]:  Melanie's father started with 50 cows and 20 chickens. 20 cows per day from Milkie Cows Limited and 10 chickens per day from Broilers Limited for 3 weeks means 20 + 10 = 30 animals per day are added.  30 animals per day for 21 days (3 weeks) means 30 x 21 = 630 animals are added. 

Total number of cows originally: 50
Number of cows added: 20 per day for 21 days = 20 x 21 = 420
Total cows now: 50 + 420 = 470 cows

Total number of chickens originally: 20
Number of chickens added: 10 per day for 21 days = 10 x 21 = 210
Total chickens now: 20 + 210 = 230

The answer is 700. 
[EXP] 740: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1, [output]:  Russell will be ordering 4 packs of bagels.  Each pack has 9 bagels, so he will be ordering 4 x 9 = 36 bagels.   The total cost will be 4 packs x $10. 00 per pack = $40.  Because of the 10% discount, he will get $4.  00 off.   So the total cost will be $40.  00 - $4.  00 = $36.  00. 36 bagels for $36.  00 will be $36.   00 / 36 = $1.   00 per bagel.  The answer is $1. 
[EXP] 741: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

1.  Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.  To find out how many scoops Gomer ate, subtract 5 from 23: 23 - 5 = 18 scoops. 
2.   It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.  To find out how many potatoes are needed for 1 less than 3 scoops, subtract 1 from 3: 3 - 1 = 2 scoops.  It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 2 scoops, so subtract 3 from 6: 6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.  Since the same relationship is needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops, Gomer needs 3 potatoes per scoop.  To find out how many potatoes Gomer needs for 18 scoops, multiply 3 potatoes per scoop by 18 scoops: 3 x 18 = 54 potatoes.  The answer is 54. 
[EXP] 742: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Chester eats 3 eggs a day for 30 days, so in total he ate 30 * 3 = 90 eggs.  Then he increased it to 5 eggs a day for another 30 days, so in total, he ate 5 * 30 = 150 eggs.  In total, he ate 90 + 150 = 240 eggs.  One dozen is 12 eggs, so 240 / 12 is 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 743: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 17 are green, and twice as many are red. 17 * 2 = 34 are red.  So 17 + 34 = 51 jelly beans are green or red.  The rest are blue.  Since 60 jelly beans total, 60 - 51 = 9 jelly beans are blue.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 744: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 300, [output]: 5 trees are originally. 6 lemons come from each tree each year. 5 * 6 = 30 lemons. 30 lemons for 10 years is 30 * 10 = 300.  The answer is 300. 
[EXP] 745: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]:  Let's first find the number of men and women on the bus initially.  Since the ratio of men to women is 5:9, the number of men can be represented as 5x and the number of women can be represented as 9x.  We know that the total number of passengers is 84, so we can set up the equation 5x + 9x = 84 to find the value of x.  Solving for x, we get:

5x + 9x = 84
14x = 84
x = 6

Therefore, there are 5x = 5*6 = 30 men and 9x = 9*6 = 54 women initially.  After 20 women alight from the bus, there will be 54 - 20 = 34 women remaining on the bus.  The answer is 34. 
[EXP] 746: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 291, [output]:  If Faraday earned 26 dollars from the sunflowers, that is 26 / 2 = 13 sunflowers.  And if he earned 56 dollars from the bouquets, that is 56 / 8 = 7 bouquets.  Each bouquet has 12 sunflowers, so that is 12 x 7 = 84 sunflowers from the bouquets.  In total, he sold 13 + 84 = 97 sunflowers.  If Faraday did this for 3 days, he sold 3 x 97 = 291 sunflowers in total.  The answer is 291. 
[EXP] 747: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Adam started with 100 dollars.  Each rock costs 5 dollars to buy and sells for 7 dollars.   To open the stand, he will have to buy some rocks.   To find out how many rocks he can buy, we can use division: 100 / 5 = 20.   So he can buy 20 rocks at most. 

Adam buys 20 rocks for $5 each, so that will be 5 x 20 = 100.  Now he has 0 dollars left.  He then sells the rocks for $7 each, which is 7 x 20 = 140.   But he only sold 60% of the rocks.   60% of 20 is 12 (20 x 0. 6 = 12).   So he sold 12 rocks.   The revenue is 12 x 7 = 84.  He spent 100 to start the stand, and gained 84 from selling the rocks.    To find out how much he lost, we can subtract: 100 - 84 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 748: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 22, [output]:  Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day.  Number of large-sized scenes: 45.  45 / 5 = 9.  So, she will take 9 days to draw all the large-sized scenes.  She can draw 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day.  Number of medium-sized scenes: 36.   36 / 6 = 6.   So, she will take 6 days to draw all the medium-sized scenes.   She can draw 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.   Number of small-sized scenes: 49.   49 / 7 = 7.  So, she will take 7 days to draw all the small-sized scenes.    Since we need to find the total number of days, we can add the days for all the three types of scenes: 9 + 6 + 7 = 22.  The answer is 22. 
[EXP] 749: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 1 dozen is 12 eggs.  Chatty prepared 3 dozen eggs, so she prepared 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.  There are 4 children.  To find out how many eggs each child receives, we do 36 / 4 = 9.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 750: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 93, [output]: 31 days in May.  Each fish needs $1 a day. 3 fish need 3 x $1 = $3 a day. 31 days in May x 3 dollars a day = 31 x 3 = 93.  The answer is 93. 
[EXP] 751: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 21, [output]:  Patricia started with 30 roses.  She gave 24 roses to her mother, so she has 30 - 24 = 6 roses left.  After buying 15 more, she has 6 + 15 = 21 roses.  The answer is 21. 
[EXP] 752: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  First, we need to find the total distance traveled by Sid.  He started with 110 miles, then added 140 miles, for a total of 110 + 140 = 250 miles.  Next, we need to find the total time taken.  He took 2 hours to travel the first 110 miles, and 3 hours for the next 140 miles.   Adding these up, we get 2 + 3 = 5 hours.  

To find the average speed, we can use the formula: 

Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time


Average Speed = 250 miles / 5 hours


Average Speed = 50 miles per hour


The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 753: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Let's solve this problem step by step.  Probability is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means impossible and 1 means certain.  The probability of the first ticket being a winner is 20%.  This is a ratio.  The probability is 20/100 or 1/5, which is equal to 0. 2. 

The second ticket is 3 times more likely to win.  This means the probability is 3 x 1/5 = 3/5, or 60%.  

When we have two independent events, the probability of both events happening is the product of the individual probabilities.   So we multiply the two probabilities together: (1/5) * (3/5) = 3/25.  This is the probability of both tickets winning.  

Now we need to convert this decimal to a percent.   We multiply by 100: 3/25 * 100 = 12%.  The answer is 12%. 
[EXP] 754: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 27 seashells is 5 more than what Carlos collected.  So we subtract 5 from 27 to get what Carlos collected: 27 - 5 = 22.   Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey, so if we call Carrey's collection X, then Carlos collected 2X.   Since we know Carlos collected 22, we can write the equation 2X = 22, and solve for X by dividing both sides by 2: X = 11.   Carrey collected 11 seashells.  In total, they collected 27 + 22 + 11 = 60.  They divided them equally among the 3 people, so each person gets 60 / 3 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 755: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]: 1 week has 7 days. 7 - 2 = 5 weekdays.  4 carrots each on 5 weekdays is 4 x 5 = 20 carrots.  On Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each, so 5 x 2 = 10 carrots. 20 carrots in 5 weekdays + 10 carrots on 2 days = 20 + 10 = 30 carrots.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 756: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  The first song is 5 minutes.  The second song is 60% longer, so it is 5 + 5 * (60/100) = 5 + 3 = 8 minutes.  The total is 5 + 8 = 13 minutes.  The answer is 13. 
[EXP] 757: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Linus buys 2 devices for 20 dollars each on monday, so that is a total of 2 x 20 = 40 dollars.  He buys 4 devices for 20 dollars each on tuesday, so that is a total of 4 x 20 = 80 dollars.  He bought a total of 6 devices for 40 + 80 = 120 dollars.  If he sold each device for twice its original price, then each device was sold for 20 x 2 = 40 dollars.  He sold 6 devices for 40 x 6 = 240 dollars.  His profit is 240 - 120 = 120 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 758: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Since Isabel is 7 feet tall, Ned is 7 - 2 = 5 feet tall, because he is 2 feet shorter than Isabel.  Since Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned, Carl is 5 + 1 = 6 feet tall.  Since Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall, Carl's cane is 6 / 2 = 3 feet long.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 759: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7300, [output]: 2300 people need 100% daily energy, so they need 2300 people total.  If each juice can cover 20% of one person's daily energy demand, then each juice can cover 0. 20 person's daily energy demand.  To cover 100% daily energy demand, 1 person's daily energy demand, would need 5 juices (100 / 20).  So 2300 people's daily energy demand would require 2300 * 5 = 11500 juices.  Since each juice is 1 bottle, it would require 11500 bottles of juice.  Hortex can produce 4200 bottles.  So it needs to produce 11500 - 4200 = 7300 more bottles.  The answer is 7300. 
[EXP] 760: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  Carla has octuplets, which means she has 8 babies. 
2.  She dresses 3/4 of them in purple, which is 3/4 x 8 = 6 babies in purple. 
3.  She dresses 1/4 of them in blue, which is 1/4 x 8 = 2 babies in blue. 3.  So there are 6 purple babies and 2 blue babies.  
4.  1/3 of the purple babies wear bows, which is 1/3 x 6 = 2 purple babies with bows.  
5.   All 2 blue babies wear bows, so there are 2 more babies with bows. 2 + 2 = 4 babies with bows in total. 
6.   We are asked what percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.  There are 4 babies with bows and 2 of them are purple.  2/4 is equal to 1/2 or 50%.  Therefore, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 50%.  The answer is 50%. 
[EXP] 761: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1125, [output]: 5168 reports were received overall.  For Monday and Tuesday, 1907 reports were received.  For Thursday and Friday, 2136 reports were received.  So, subtracting the reports received on those days (1907 + 2136) from the total (5168), we get the number of reports received on Wednesday:
5168 - (1907 + 2136) = 5168 - 4043 = 1125
The IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.  The answer is 1125.

[EXP] 765: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]: 1 dozen eggs is 12 eggs. 3 dozen eggs is 3 x 12 = 36 eggs.  Lamar finds 5 eggs.  Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so she finds 2 x 5 = 10 eggs.  Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so he finds 10 - 2 = 8 eggs.  Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so she finds 8/2 = 4 eggs.  In total, they found 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 eggs.  So there are 36 - 27 = 9 eggs left in the yard.  The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 766: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 1248, [output]:  Let's start by finding the number of apartments in the first two complexes.  There are 200 apartments each, so in total that is 200 + 200 = 400 apartments.  The third complex is 60% bigger than the other two combined.  To find 60% of 400, we multiply 0. 60 by 400 to get 240.  So the third complex has 240 apartments.  In total, there are 400 + 240 = 640 apartments that John collects garbage from.  Since he collects garbage 3 times a week from each place, he collects garbage from 3 x 640 = 1920 apartments each week.   He gets paid $0. 40 per collection for each apartment.  So he makes 0. 40 x 1920 = $768 per week.  The answer is 768. 
[EXP] 767: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2350, [output]: 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits. 
A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 x 50 = 150 fruits. 
A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 x 50 = 350 fruits. 
A 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.  Let's start by calculating the production of the 10-year-old tree: 20 times the initial amount is 20 x 50 = 1000 fruits.  200 fruits less would be 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.  Therefore, the 8-year-old tree produces 800 fruits.  
The total fruits for the first 8 years are 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 = 1350 fruits.  The 9th year the tree doesn't produce any fruit.  The 10th year, the 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits.  The total fruits produced in 10 years is 1350 + 1000 = 2350.  The answer is 2350. 
[EXP] 768: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]:  Jack started with $100. 1/5 of Sophia's money is the same as 1/5 * $100 = $20.  Jack received $20 from Sophia, so he now has $100 + $20 = $120.  The answer is $120. 
[EXP] 769: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  We know the total length of the three ropes is 37 centimeters.  Let's call the length of the blue rope "b" in centimeters.   The length of the yellow rope is b + 7, and the length of the red rope is 4 * b.  We can now write the equation: b + (b + 7) + 4 * b = 37.   Combining like terms, we get 6 * b + 7 = 37.  Subtracting 7 from both sides gives  6 * b = 30.  Dividing both sides by 6 gives b = 5.   Since the length of the blue rope is 5, the length of the yellow rope is 5 + 7 = 12, and the length of the red rope is 4 * 5 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 770: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ronnie was given $5 and Rissa was given thrice as much, so Rissa was given 5 x 3 = $15. 

Then, both of them gave an equal amount to their little sister.  Say they gave x amount to their little sister.  So, 5 - x = the amount left in Ronnie's money and 15 - x = the amount left in Rissa's money. 

Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money, so:

15 - x = 4/5 * 15
15 - x = 12
x = 3

So they gave their little sister 3 dollars.  Originally Ronnie had 5 dollars and gave 3 dollars, so he will have 5 - 3 = 2 dollars left.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 771: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 12 pints of paint were used in total.  Half the mural is yellow, so 12 / 2 = 6 pints of paint was used for the yellow part.  The other 3 colors have equal amounts, so they combined use 12 - 6 = 6 pints of paint.  Since 3 out of the 4 colors have equal amounts, each of the 3 colors using 6 / 3 = 2 pints of paint.  Red, white, and purple each used 2 pints of paint, so red used 2 pints of paint.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 772: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3160, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

1.  Tom has 4 bedrooms, each measuring 20 x 12 = 240 square feet.  So, the total area of the bedrooms is 4 x 240 = 960 square feet. 

2.  The living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom, so it's 5 x 240 = 1200 square feet.  So far, the total area is 960 + 1200 = 2160 square feet.  The rest of the house is 1000 square feet. 

3.  So, the total area of the house is 2160 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.   The answer is 3160. 
[EXP] 773: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 93, [output]:  Alice started on Monday by counting 3 puffs of clouds.  Since the number of clouds double each day, on Tuesday, she will see 3 * 2 = 6 puffs of clouds.  On Wednesday, she will see 6 * 2 = 12 puffs, on Thursday 12 * 2 = 24 puffs, and on Friday 24 * 2 = 48 puffs.  To count the total number of clouds across all five days, we simply add up the puffs she counted each day: 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 93.  The answer is 93. 
[EXP] 774: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.  A new special box has 20% more pods.  20% of 100 is 20.  So the new box has 100 + 20 = 120 pods.  The price remains the same, $12. 

The question asks how many dishwashing cycles with the new box can you run for $1 if you use 1 pod per cycle.   Well, you can spend $1 on 120/12 = 10 pods.  So you can run 10 cycles with the new box for $1.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 775: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Thomas withdrew 1000 dollars in 20 dollar bills. 1000/20 = 50 bills.  He lost 10 bills.  So, he had 50 - 10 = 40 bills left.  Then, he used half to pay for a bill.   Half of 40 is 20 bills.   40 - 20 is 20.   He had 20 bills left.   Then, he tripled his money.   He now has 60 bills (20 * 3).  Then, he converted the bills to 5 dollar bills.  60 bills of 20 dollars converted to 120 bills of 5 dollars.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 776: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 16, [output]:  Let's start by finding out how many goals team B scored in the first half.  Team A scored 4 goals in the first half, and team B scored 2 goals fewer than team A, so team B scored 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half. 

In the second half, team A scored 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B.  Team B scored 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, so it scored 4 x 2 = 8 goals in the second half.  1/4 of 8 is 2, so team A scored 2 goals in the second half. 

Now we can find the total number of goals scored by each team:

* Team A: 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals
* Team B: 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals

So the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 + 10 = 16.  The answer is 16. 
[EXP] 777: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 5 inches is the original length of the chalk.  The teacher uses 45% of it the first day.  5 * 0. 45 = 2. 25.  So the chalk is now 5 - 2. 25 = 2. 75 inches long.  The chalk is too small to be used anymore, because it is smaller than 2 inches.   So the teacher must recycle it now. 

Let's create an equation to find how many days until the chalk has to be recycled.  Let the variable D represent the number of days.  Since the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day, the teacher will use 0. 2 * 5 = 1 inch each day.   After D days, the chalk will be 5 - D * 1 = 4 - D inches long.  We want this to be equal to 2 inches, since that's when the chalk needs to be recycled.    If 4 - D = 2, then D = 2.   So the teacher has 2 days left.  The teacher will recycle the chalk.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 778: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]: 1/3 of the girls are on varsity.  To find 1/3 of 12, multiply 12 by 1/3, which is 12/3 = 4.  So 4 girls are on varsity.  We subtract these from the total number of girls, 12, to get 12 - 4 = 8.   There are 8 girls that are not on varsity. 

1/4 of the boys are on varsity.  To find 1/4 of 12, multiply 12 by 1/4, which is 12/4 = 3.   So 3 boys are on varsity.  We subtract these from the total number of boys, 12, to get 12 - 3 = 9.    There are 9 boys that are not on varsity. 

In total, there are 8 non-varsity girls and 9 non-varsity boys, so the number of students not on varsity is 8 + 9 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 779: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 17, [output]:  Mike bought 5 face masks. 3 times 5 is 15, and 2 more than that is 15 + 2 = 17.  The answer is 17. 
[EXP] 780: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  James had 30 teeth.   The dentist drills 4 teeth.  After the dentist drills 4 teeth, James will have 30 - 4 = 26 teeth remaining.   The dentist caps 7 more teeth than the number of teeth he drilled.   Since the dentist drilled 4 teeth, he will cap 7 + 4 = 11 teeth.  The total number of teeth the dentist fixes is 4 + 11 = 15 teeth.  To find the percentage of teeth the dentist fixes, you divide 15 by the original number of teeth, 30, and multiply by 100:

(15 ÷ 30) x 100 = 50

So, the dentist fixes 50% of James' teeth.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 781: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5600, [output]:  The company sold 4000 gallons of milk at 3. 5 dollars per gallon.  So the total amount spent by Mr.  Marcellus is 4000 x 3. 5 = 14000 dollars. 

However, 2/5 of the amount was spoiled and returned.  2/5 * 4000 is 1600 gallons.  So Mr.  Marcellus got a refund for 1600 gallons.  At 3. 5 dollars per gallon, the refund amount is 1600 * 3. 5 = 5600 dollars.  The answer is 5600.

According to the problem, Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.  So we can say: 
Wendy's age = 5 * (X + 7)

In 25 years, Colin will be X + 25 years old.  According to the problem, in 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.  So we can say: 
X + 25 = 1/3 * Wendy's current age

We can substitute the first equation with Wendy's current age into the second equation:
X + 25 = 1/3 * 5 * (X + 7)

Combine like terms:
X + 25 = (5X + 35) / 3
Multiply both sides by 3:
3X + 75 = 5X + 35
Subtract 3X from both sides:
75 = 2X + 35
Subtract 35 from both sides:
40 = 2X
Divide both sides by 2:
20 = X

So Colin is currently 20 years old.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 783: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1800, [output]:  Bob spends $27000 dollars.  If he can buy 100 books for $500, then he can buy 1 package of 100 books for every 500 dollars he spends.  So to see how many books he can by in total, we divide 27000 by 500 to see how many packages of 100 books he can buy.  27000 / 500 = 54.  This means Bob can buy 54 packages of 100 books.  Finally, to see how many books per school, we divide the total by 3 since it's distributed among 3 schools.  54 packages * 100 books per package = 5400 books total, and 5400 / 3 = 1800 books per school.  The answer is 1800. 
[EXP] 784: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 11, [output]:  Let's break this problem down:

Initially, 2 apples fell out of the tree. 

Newton picked up 2 apples and put 1 in his pocket, leaving 1 apple. 

Then, the other apple he threw into the tree caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree.  So, he now has 6 apples (the original apple + the 5 new ones). 

He put all but 1 of these apples in his pocket, leaving 1 apple. 

Then, he threw the remaining apple at the tree, causing another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.  Now, he has 7 apples (the 1 he left on the ground + the 6 new ones).  

He picked up all these apples and went home, so he brought home 7 apples.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 785: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 306, [output]: 850 kg of coal is delivered in 50 kg bags. 850 divided by 50 is 17, so Ali ordered 17 bags of coal. 17 bags each costing 18 dollars is 17 x 18, which is 306.  The answer is 306. 
[EXP] 786: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]: 6 friends eat 6 slices of cheese pizza each and 4 slices of pepperoni pizza each, so they eat a total of 6 * 6 = 36 cheese slices and 6 * 4 = 24 pepperoni slices.  To find out how many cheese pizzas they need, we can divide the total number of cheese slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza: 36 / 12 = 3.  So they need 3 cheese pizzas.  Similarly, to find out how many pepperoni pizzas they need, we can divide the total number of pepperoni slices eaten by the number of slices per pizza: 24 / 8 = 3.  So they need 3 pepperoni pizzas.   We need 3 cheese pizzas and 3 pepperoni pizzas, so in total we need 3 + 3 = 6 pizzas.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 787: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  That's a total of 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 miles.  On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each, so that's a total of 5 + 5 = 10 miles.  Adding these two totals, 9 + 10 = 19.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 788: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Jay builds snowballs at a rate of 20 per hour, so for one hour he builds 20 snowballs.  Since two snowballs melt every 15 minutes, in one hour he loses 2 x 4 = 8 snowballs.  So his net snowball production rate is 20 - 8 = 12 snowballs per hour.  To make 60 snowballs, he will need 60 ÷ 12 = 5 hours.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 789: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 24, [output]:  Let's think about this step by step.  Digimon came out 20 years ago.  John is now 28.   So 20 years ago, John was 28 - 20 = 8.  That means Jim was half John's age (because John is twice Jim's age at that time), which means Jim was 8 / 2 = 4.   Now Jim is 4 + 20 = 24.  The answer is 24. 
[EXP] 790: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 6, [output]:  Doxa ate 1 slice. 1 more is eaten by her sister, so her sister ate 1 + 1 = 2 slices. 1 more than her sister is eaten by her brother, so her brother ate 2 + 1 = 3 slices.  In total, they ate 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 slices.  The answer is 6. 
[EXP] 791: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.   They used 38 out of the 50, so they had 50 - 38 = 12 bandages left at the end of the first day.  
On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day, which is 38 - 10 = 28 bandages.   They don't have any additional information about the bandages for the second day, so let's move on to the third day. 
On the third day, they ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages, which is 2 x 50 = 100 bandages.  They used half a pack, so that's 50/2 = 25 bandages.  By the end of the third day, they had 78 bandages left.   We can calculate the number of bandages they had left after the second day: 78 + 25 = 103.   This means they had 103 bandages after using 28 bandages on the second day, so we can subtract: 103 - 28 = 75.  They had 75 bandages left after the second day.   
On the first day, they had 12 bandages left, and we know they used 38 bandages.   So they started with 12 + 38 = 50 more bandages.   This matches the 50 bandages in a bulk pack, which is what they ordered.  So, they had 50 bandages at the beginning of the first day.  The answer is 50. 
[EXP] 792: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's first subtract the final length from the initial length to find the length of hair cut: 10 - 8 = 2 inches.  Since it costs $30 per inch of haircut, she cut 2 inches of hair, so that costs 2 x 30 = 60.  Adding the $40 for color, the total cost of the cut and color is 60 + 40 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 793: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 280, [output]: 1) Jen works 7. 5 hours a day.  And 6 days a week.  So each week she works 7. 5 x 6 = 45 hours.  And there are 4 weeks in April.  So she worked 45 x 4 = 180 hours in April.  Her hourly rate is $1. 5.  So she earns 180 x $1. 5 = $270.   She also gets an additional$10 for complete attendance.   The answer is $280. 
[EXP] 794: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 9, [output]:  Jason earned for laundry 1 * 3. 00 = 3. 00.  He took the trash out 2 times for 2 * 0. 75 = 1. 50.  He emptied the dishwasher 6 times for 6 * 0. 50 = 3.  00.   He cleaned his room 1 time for 1 * 1.  50 = 1.  50.   Adding up his revenue, we have 3.  00 + 1. 50 + 3.  00 + 1.  50 = 9.   00.   The answer is 9. 
[EXP] 795: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1200, [output]: 40 gallons of blood is the amount of blood a whale has. 3 times as much blood as a whale means a shark has 40 x 3 = 120 gallons of blood. 10 sharks will have 10 x 120 = 1200 gallons of blood.  The answer is 1200. 
[EXP] 796: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 320, [output]: 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.  Then 40 more people entered.  So 50 + 40 = 90 people entered the restaurant by 10:00.  Then, twice the number, or 2 x 40 = 80 people, came in and ordered lunch.  90 + 80 = 170 people.  After that, 3 times the number of the first people, or 3 x 50 = 150 people, entered the restaurant.  170 + 150 = 320 people.   The answer is 320. 
[EXP] 797: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]: 5 packs of red pens, with 5 pens per pack, is 5 x 5 = 25 red pens. 2 times the amount of black pens than the red is 2 x 25 = 50 black pens. 50 black pens + 25 red pens = 75 pens.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 798: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2400, [output]: 10 bottles of scotch cost 600 dollars.  This means the cost of one scotch bottle is 600 / 10 = 60 dollars.  The number of cognac bottles is twice the number of scotch bottles, so John bought 10 * 2 = 20 bottles of cognac.   The cost of cognac bottles is 50% more per bottle.  50% of 60 is 30, so the cost of one cognac bottle is 60 + 30 = 90 dollars.  The total cost of cognac bottles is 20 * 90 = 1800 dollars.  Total cost of everything is 600 dollars for scotch and 1800 dollars for cognac, so John spent 600 + 1800 = 2400 dollars.  The answer is 2400. 
[EXP] 799: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 140, [output]:  Mr.  Julius planted 20 White Oak trees on the first day.  He planted twice as many Lodgepole Pine trees as White Oak trees, which is 2 * 20 = 40 Lodgepole Pine trees.  In total, on the first day, he planted 20 + 40 = 60 trees. 

 On the second day, he planted 10 more White Oak trees, which is 20 + 10 = 30 White Oak trees.  He planted 1/4 more Lodgepole Pine trees than on the first day.  The number of Lodgepole Pine trees he planted on the first day is 40, and 1/4 * 40 is 10, so on the second day, he planted 40 + 10 = 50 Lodgepole Pine trees.   In total, on the second day, he planted 30 + 50 = 80 trees.  In total, he planted 60 + 80 = 140 trees.  The answer is 140. 
[EXP] 800: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 24 gallons of root beer were made initially.  4 gallons were drank by his children.  So 24 - 4 = 20 gallons were left.  Then 7 gallons were spilled, so 20 - 7 = 13 gallons were left.  Then 5 gallons were taken by Ronnie, so 13 - 5 = 8 gallons were left.  After that, the rest was shared among 3 people and Fred, which means there were 8 / 4 = 2 gallons left for each person.  The answer is 2 gallons. 
[EXP] 801: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 4 times the number of coffee mugs is "4x". 8 more than that is "4x + 8". 4x + 8 = 40. 4x = 40 - 8.  4x = 32.  x = 32 / 4.  x = 8.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 802: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 42, [output]: 1/3 of the fish have red stripes, which is 66 * 1/3 = 22 fish.  So 66 - 22 = 44 fish remain. 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes, which is 44 * 5/11 = 20 fish. 22 + 20 = 42.  The answer is 42. 
[EXP] 803: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 19, [output]:  Amy started with 2 palettes with 4 colors each.  So she had 2 x 4 = 8 colors in palettes.  She also had 3 makeup sets with 6 colors each.  That makes 3 x 6 = 18 more colors.  So in total, she had 8 + 18 = 26 colors.  Then her sister stole one palette, which is 4 colors.  Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set, which is 6 / 2 = 3 colors.  In total, she lost 4 + 3 = 7 colors.  She started with 26 colors and lost 7.  So she has 26 - 7 = 19 colors left.  The answer is 19. 
[EXP] 804: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 240, [output]:  Mattison is 60 inches tall.  The two-story house is 7 times as high as him, so it is 7 x 60 = 420 inches tall.  The floor to ceiling on the first floor is thrice his height, so it is 3 x 60 = 180 inches.  This means that the second story is 420 - 180 = 240 inches tall.  The roof is 240 inches from the second floor's floor.  The answer is 240. 
[EXP] 805: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 168, [output]: 700 shells were found. 40% of the shells were found by Alphas, so 700 * 0. 4 = 280 shells were found by Alphas. 700 - 280 = 420 shells were left. 60% of the remaining 420 shells were found by The finders, so 420 * 0. 6 = 252 shells were found by The finders.  420 - 252 = 168 shells were left, which were found by Gogetters.  The answer is 168. 
[EXP] 806: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  Let's calculate the total number of miles the first, second, and third dogs need in a day: 1 + 4 + 3 = 8 miles.  All four dogs need an average of 3 miles each, so the total is 4 x 3 = 12 miles.   Since the first three dogs need 8 miles, the last dog needs the remaining: 12 - 8 = 4 miles.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 807: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 40,000, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 40% of $250,000 is 40/100 * 250,000 = $100,000.  He got a loan of $100,000.  He used 60% of that to pay off his debts. 60/100 * 100,000 = $60,000.  To find out how much money he had leftover, subtract $60,000 from $100,000: 100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000.  The answer is 40,000. 
[EXP] 808: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Deandre has 3 tunas.  The first tuna weighs 56 kilograms.  The second tuna weighs 46 kilograms.  The last tuna weighs 26 kilograms.   Added together, these 3 tunas weigh 56 + 46 + 26 = 128 kilograms.   Each kilogram is worth 0. 50 dollars.   So the total value of the tunas is 128 x 0. 50 = 64.    The answer is 64. 
[EXP] 809: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]: 72 dollars is the cost of buying the magazines. 11/8 is the fraction of the price she sells the magazines at.  To find how much she sells the magazines for, multiply 72 by 11/8. 
72 * 11/8 = 99
So she sells the magazines for 99 dollars. 99 - 72 = 27 dollars.  The answer is 27 dollars is her profit. 
[EXP] 810: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 29, [output]:  We are given the information that the low setting removes 1 liter of water out of the air per day, the medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, and the high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting.  This means that the medium setting removes 2 liters of water per day, and the high setting removes 4 liters of water per day. 

We can start by finding the amount of moisture removed on the low setting:
The dehumidifier was run for 3 days at the low setting, so it removed 1 liter x 3 days = 3 liters of moisture.  Then it was run for 3 days on the medium setting, so it removed 2 liters x 3 days = 6 liters of moisture.   Finally, it was run for 5 days on the high setting, so it removed 4 liters x 5 days = 20 liters of moisture. 

The total amount of moisture removed is 3 liters + 6 liters + 20 liters = 29 liters.  The answer is 29 liters. 
[EXP] 811: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 288, [output]: 10 packs of balloons will have 10 x 30 = 300 balloons. 12 balloons are left after they are finished. 300 - 12 = 288.  The answer is 288.

The answer is 448. 
[EXP] 813: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 150, [output]:  Let's start by finding the capacity of John's classes. 1/8 of 120 is 15, so each of John's classes has 15 students.  Since he has two classes, the total capacity of John's school is 2 x 15 = 30 students. 

Now, let's add the capacity of Ali's school to the capacity of John's school.  Ali's school has 120 students, and John's school has 30 students.   So the combined capacity of both schools is 120 + 30 = 150 students.  The answer is 150. 
[EXP] 814: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Stephen started with a debt of $300. 2% of $300 is $6.  So the total amount he owes is $300 + $6 = $306.  He pays $25 each month for 11 months, which is 11 x $25 = $275.  So he has paid $275 so far.  In the twelfth month, he will pay the remaining amount, which is $306 - $275 = $31.  The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 815: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Jordan has 2 children who wear diapers. 5 diaper changes per day per child means 5 x 2 = 10 total diaper changes per day.  Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers.  So, Jordan changes 10 / 2 = 5 diapers per day.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 816: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Let's break down the problem step by step. 

1.  Calculate the volume of the jar: The jar has a square base with edges of 6 inches, so its area is 6 x 6 = 36 square inches.  Since it's 15 inches tall, the volume is 36 x 15 = 540 cubic inches. 
2.  Calculate the total number of jelly beans: With 80% efficiency in packing, we can assume that 80% of the volume is filled with jelly beans.  So, 0. 8 x 540 = 432 cubic inches are filled with jelly beans.  Since each jelly bean is 0. 15 cubic inches, we can divide the number of cubic inches filled by the volume of each jelly bean to get the total number of jelly beans:  432 / 0. 15 = 2880. 
3.   Calculate the number of red jelly beans: Because Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red, we can take 30% of 2880 to get the number of red jelly beans: 0. 3 x 2880 = 864.  Since the true number of red jelly beans is 900, Tim's guess was 900 - 864 = 36 off.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 817: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 20 people were in the bus initially.  Then, 40 people entered at the first stop.  So, there were 20 + 40 = 60 people in the bus after the first stop.  

At the second stop, 3/4 of 40 entered the bus.  3/4 of 40 is 30, so 30 people entered the bus.  Then, there were 60 + 30 = 90 people in the bus.  After that, the number of passengers doubled, so the number of people increased to 2 x 90 = 180 people in the bus.  Since the bus can hold 200 people, it requires 200 - 180 = 20 people to fill the remaining spaces in the bus.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 818: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 75, [output]:  Pauline visits the museum 3 times a year. 3 visits per year for 5 years means she visited 3 x 5 = 15 times.  The cost of one visit is 2 dollars.  So she spent 2 x 15 = 30 dollars on visits for the first 5 years. 

Then, the cost of one visit increased by 150%.  150% of 2 is 3.   So the new cost of one visit is 2 + 3 = 5 dollars.  Pauline continued to visit 3 times a year for 3 more years, so she visited 3 x 3 = 9 times.  The cost of all those visits is 5 x 9 = 45 dollars.  To get the total cost of all visits, add the cost for the first 5 years and the cost for the next 3 years: 30 + 45 = 75.  The answer is 75. 
[EXP] 819: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 225, [output]:  There are 4 grades from 4 to 7 so, 4 x 10 = 40 students who are qualified. 40 students, but only 8 can go at a time.  To find the number of groups, we can divide 40 by 8. 40 ÷ 8 = 5 groups.  Each group takes 45 minutes.  So, the total time it will take is 5 x 45 minutes = 225 minutes.  The answer is 225. 
[EXP] 820: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  John made 4 wooden tables for $20 each.  4 x 20 = 80 dollars.  He also made 2 roof frames for $10 each.  2 x 10 = 20 dollars.   So in total, 80 + 20 = 100.  The answer is 100. 
[EXP] 821: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 32, [output]:  Let's say the shorter piece is x feet long.  The longer piece is 4 times longer, so it's 4x feet long.  The total length of the board is 40 feet, which is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces.  So we can set up the equation:

x + 4x = 40

Combine like terms:

5x = 40

Divide by 5:

x = 8

So the shorter piece is 8 feet long.  Since the longer piece is 4 times longer, the longer piece is:

4x = 4(8)
= 32 feet

So the longer piece is 32 feet long.  The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 822: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 80 meatballs require 80 / 16 = 5 pounds of ground beef.  He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound. 5 pounds will require 5 x 2 = 10 tablespoons of seasoning.  The answer is 10. 
[EXP] 823: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 350, [output]: 5 windows, and each window is 35 inches wide. 5 x 35 is 175.  So the total width of the windows is 175 inches. 2 times the total width is 175 x 2 = 350.  The answer is 350. 
[EXP] 824: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  To make a call from a payphone, you must pay $0. 25 for each minute of your call.  After 16 minutes, that price drops to $0.  2 per minute.   So for the first 16 minutes, the call will cost 16 x $0.  25 = $4.   For the last 20 minutes, the call will cost 20 x $0.  2 = $4.    In total, the 36-minute call will cost $4 + $4 = $8.  The answer is $8. 
[EXP] 825: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 2 inches of rain on Monday. 2 inches * 2 (twice of Monday's total) is 4 inches.  4 inches + 1 inch (one more inch than Tuesday's expected rain) is 5 inches of rain on Tuesday.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 826: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3, [output]:  Let's start by letting x be the number of cupcakes Carly made.  Then, she makes 3x - 2 brownies.  If each person gets 2 treats and there are 5 people in the class, then the total number of treats is 2 * 5 = 10.  So, the total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and the brownies: x + (3x - 2) = 10.  Combine like terms to get 4x - 2 = 10.  Add 2 to both sides to get 4x = 12.   Divide both sides by 4 to get x = 3.   So, Carly must have made 3 cupcakes.  The answer is 3. 
[EXP] 827: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 90, [output]: 1st, find the price of both services with 20% off:

Basic manicure $35
Pedicure $40
Total price $75
20% discount = 20% of $75 = $15
Total cost = $75 - $15 = $60

Next, calculate the cost of the nail art:

Nail art on 10 fingers = 10 x $3 = $30

Overall, Karen would pay:

$60 for both services + $30 for nail art = $90.  The answer is $90. 
[EXP] 828: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 66, [output]:  Susan has 3 magazines that send 12 issues a year. 1 magazine that sends 6 issues a year.  And the last magazine sends 4 * 6 = 24 issues a year. 

First, let's consider the magazines that send 12 issues a year.  Since there are 3 of them, she gets 3 * 12 = 36 issues from them. 

Next, let's consider the magazine that sends 6 issues per year.  She gets 6 from this magazine.  The last magazine is 4 times more than 6 issues per year, which is 24 issues per year.  

Now, add the 36 issues from the 12-issue magazines, the 6 issues from the 6-issue magazine, and the 24 issues from the last magazine.  

36 + 6 + 24 = 66

So Susan gets 66 issues every year.  The answer is 66. 
[EXP] 829: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Samantha starts with 27 paintings.  Samantha has 12 fewer than Shelley, so Shelley has 27 + 12 = 39 paintings.  Shelley has 8 more than Kim, so Kim has 39 - 8 = 31 paintings.  Samantha has 27, Shelley has 39, and Kim has 31.  The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 830: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]: 1st, the price in December increased by 80% of $40. 80% of $40 is 80/100 x 40 = 32. 40 + 32 = 72.  The price in December was $72. 2nd, the price in January decreased by 50% of $72.  50% of $72 is 50/100 x 72 = 36. 72 - 36 = 36.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 831: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 440, [output]:  Charlie has 4 lessons at the standard rate, so he makes 4 * 80 = 320 dollars. 1/4 * 80 = 20, so he reduces his rate by 20 to 60 for the teacher.  2 lessons at this rate will earn him 2 * 60 = 120 dollars. 320 + 120 = 440.  The answer is 440.

[EXP] 833: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Eve started with 20 pomelos.  If she is left with 1/4 of the pomelos she originally had, that means she has 20 / 4 = 5 pomelos left.  She has given away 20 - 5 = 15 pomelos.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 834: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 81, [output]:  Walter started with 60 apples.  He ate 2/5 of them.  2/5 of 60 is 24, so he ate 24 apples.  After eating 24 apples, he had 60 - 24 = 36 apples left. 

Then, he gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.  25% of 36 is 9, so he gave his sister 9 apples.  36 - 9 = 27 apples left.  These 27 apples he sold to his uncle at $3 each.  27 x 3 is 81.  The answer is 81. 
[EXP] 835: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 9 novels is 3 quarters of the number of novels Regina wrote this year.  So if she wrote 9 in 3 quarters, she wrote 9 * 4/3 = 12 in the whole year.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 836: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]: 50km/hr is Michael's average speed.  If he's traveling for 3 days, that's a total of 3 x 24 = 72 hours.  Because speed = distance / time, we can solve for the distance he has traveled:

distance = average speed * time
distance = 50 * 72
distance = 3600

He has traveled 3600 km.  The total distance from Alaska to Texas is 6000 km.  To find what percentage of the distance he has covered, we can divide the distance he has traveled (3600) by the total distance, then multiply by 100:

(3600 / 6000) * 100 = 60%

The answer is 60%. 
[EXP] 837: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 84, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Madeline ate 6 grapes, and her brother used up 5 times as many grapes to make a full glass.  So the brother used 6 x 5 = 30 grapes. 

Now, there were originally some grapes left, but we don't know how many.  Let's call the number of grapes at the beginning x.  After Madeline and her brother took some, there were x - (6 + 30) grapes left.  

These remaining grapes were used to make 4 pies, and each pie recipe calls for 12 grapes.  So 4 x 12 = 48 grapes were used for the pies.  But we just said that the remaining grapes after Madeline and her brother took some were used for the pies.  So we can set up the equation:

x - (6 + 30) = 48

We need to isolate x to find out how many grapes there were at the beginning.  First, we combine the constants:

x - 36 = 48

Then, we add 36 to both sides:

x = 48 + 36
x = 84

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.  The answer is 84. 
[EXP] 838: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 78, [output]: 82 teachers were originally at the school. 13 teachers were sick, so the number of teachers left is 82 - 13 = 69. 9 substitute teachers were added, so the total number of teachers at school that day is 69 + 9 = 78.  The answer is 78. 
[EXP] 839: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 520, [output]:  There are several steps to solve this problem.  First, let's calculate how much Bud spends on ingredients for one week of macaroni and cheese.  Pasta is $1, cheddar cheese is $3, and gruyere cheese is twice that, or $6, for a total of $1 + 3 + 6 = $10 for one week of ingredients.  In one year, Bud will make 52 weeks of macaroni and cheese.   52 * 10 = 520 dollars.  The answer is 520. 
[EXP] 840: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 80 classrooms need to be cleaned in 5 days. 80 / 5 = 16 classrooms per day.  To clean each classroom, it takes 15 minutes.  So it will take them 16 * 15 = 240 minutes per day. 8 hours is 8 * 60 minutes, which is 480 minutes. 240 out of 480 is 50%.  So the custodian spends 50% of their day cleaning classrooms, on average.  The answer is 50%. 
[EXP] 841: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Let's start by figuring out how many books each shelf can hold:

* Middle shelves: 10 books each
* Bottom shelf: 2 x 10 = 20 books
* Top shelf: 20 - 5 = 15 books

So, the total number of books each bookcase can hold is:

* 2 middle shelves: 2 x 10 = 20 books
* Bottom shelf: 20 books
* Top shelf: 15 books
* Total: 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 books per bookcase

Elly has 110 books.  To find out how many bookcases she needs, we can divide the total number of books by the number of books each bookcase can hold:

110 ÷ 55 = 2

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases to hold all her books.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 842: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 5 dozens of eggs means 5 * 12 = 60 eggs. 60 eggs cost 5 * 2. 40 = $12.  She will sell each set of 3 eggs for $1. 60 eggs will be 60 / 3 = 20 sets of 3 eggs.  She will sell for 20 x 1 = $20.  Profit is 20 - 12 = $8.  The answer is $8. 
[EXP] 843: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]: 100 hats are originally on Skyler's hand. 1/2 of 100 is 50, so 50 hats are red. 100 - 50 = 50 hats are left, and 3/5 of 50 is 30, so 30 hats are blue. 50 - 30 = 20 hats are left, and these are white.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 844: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]: 1 bag of beef jerky costs $18. 1 bag with a $3. 00 discount is $18 - $3 = $15.  Each bag contains 30 sticks.  So the cost per stick of jerky is $15 / 30 = $0. 50 per stick.  There are 100 cents in one US dollar, so $0. 50 is 50 cents.  The answer is 50 cents. 
[EXP] 845: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 35, [output]:  Audrey has to pass two tests.  On the first test, there are 70 questions.  She gets 60% of them correct.  So she gets 0. 60 * 70 = 42 questions correct on the first test.  Then on the second test, there are 40 questions.   To pass, she has to get 70% of the total questions right.   There is a total of 70 + 40 = 110 questions.  She gets 70% * 110 = 77 questions correct in total.  She got 42 questions correct on the first test.  To get 77 questions correct in total, she needs to get 77 - 42 = 35 questions correct on the second test.  The answer is 35. 
[EXP] 846: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 96, [output]:  Let's first find the number of strawberry cubes.  We don't know it yet.  Let's call it x.  

She makes blueberry cubes equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4, so she makes 5x-4 blueberry cubes.  We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116.  So,  x + (5x - 4) = 116.  Combine like terms:  6x - 4 = 116.  Add 4 to both sides:  6x = 120.   Divide by 6:  x = 20.   So the number of strawberry cubes is 20.   And the number of blueberry cubes is 5x-4 = 5*20-4 = 96.  The answer is 96.

So 15 / 1 = 15 * 2 = 30 customers need to come into the dealership.   Based on the historical averages, for every 1 person to come into the dealership, 25 calls should have been made.  So for 30 people to come into the dealership, 25 * 30 = 750 calls must be made.  The answer is 750. 
[EXP] 850: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 56, [output]:  There are 4 people in Brianna's family. 1 flashlight for each person means 4 flashlights. 8 rooms in the house and 2 flashlights for each room means 8 x 2 = 16 more flashlights.  In total, there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights. 

There are 4 small candles for half the rooms, and 5 medium candles for the other half.  Half of 8 rooms is 4, so 4 rooms get 4 small candles each, which is 4 x 4 = 16 small candles.  The other 4 rooms will get 5 medium candles each, which is 4 x 5 = 20 medium candles.   In total, there are 16 small candles and 20 medium candles.  So, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles. 

In total, there are 36 candles and 20 flashlights.  The answer is 56.

The rest of the plants need a quarter cup of water. 20 - 4 - 8 = 8 plants need a quarter cup of water.  So 8 x 1/4 = 2 cups of water. 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 cups of water.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 857: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]: 200 yards is the total distance Phineas needs to travel.  Half of the distance is on land and half is in water, so the land part is 100 yards and the water part is also 100 yards.  Phineas hops 20 yards per minute on land, and swims 10 yards per minute in water.  On land, it will take him 100 yards ÷ 20 yards per minute = 5 minutes to travel the land part of the distance.  In water, it will take him 100 yards ÷ 10 yards per minute = 10 minutes to travel the water part of the distance.   So in total, it will take him 5 + 10 minutes = 15 minutes to return home.  The answer is 15. 
[EXP] 858: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]:  Bob needs 56 popsicle sticks.  If each box has 8 popsicle sticks, then we need to divide 56 by 8 to find out how many boxes we need: 56 / 8 = 7.

[EXP] 859: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step.  The main phone costs $20.  There are 4 additional phones, each of which costs half the price of the main phone (since the main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone).   So the 4 additional phones cost 4 x ($20 / 2) = 4 x $10 = $40.  In total, the phone plan costs $20 (for the main phone) + $40 (for the additional phones) = $60.   The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 860: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 7200, [output]: 10 dozen doughnuts is 10 x 12 = 120 doughnuts.  And $2 per doughnut, so the total amount of money is 120 x 2 = 240 dollars.  Derrick makes 240 dollars a day, but since the problem asks how much he made in June, we need to multiply by the number of days in June, which is 30. 240 x 30 = 7,200.  The answer is 7,200. 
[EXP] 861: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 210 photos are taken. 7 photos in each batch. 210 divided by 7 is the number of batches. 210/7 = 30.  So there are 30 batches. 6 batches in each day.  30/6 is 5 days.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 862: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 235, [output]:  Alicia's weekly drop-off includes 5 blouses, 2 pants and 1 skirt.  The cost for 5 blouses is 5 x 5. 00 = 25 dollars.  For 2 pants it is 2 x 8. 00 = 16 dollars.  For 1 skirt it is 1 x 6. 00 = 6 dollars.   So the total per week is 25 + 16 + 6 = 47 dollars.   For 5 weeks, the cost will be 5 x 47 = 235 dollars.  The answer is 235. 
[EXP] 863: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  John originally spoke at 150 words per minute.  After training, he spoke 2. 5 times faster, so 150 * 2. 5 = 375 words per minute. 

Now, he has to speak 10 * 450 = 4500 words.  If he speaks at 375 words per minute, it will take him 4500 / 375 minutes to finish speaking.  4500 / 375 is 12.  The answer is 12. 
[EXP] 864: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 500, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

There were 50 people on the first day.  The next day, there were 20 more people than on the first day.  50 + 20 = 70. 

So, there were 70 people on the second day. 

On the third day, the number of people increased to twice the number on the second day.  70 x 2 = 140.  

Now, we know that for the rest of the week Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.   There are 5 days for which we know the number of people.   First day: 50.   Second day: 70.   Third day: 140.  So now we can calculate the total for these 3 days:  50 + 70 + 140 = 260.  For the remaining 5 - 3 = 2 days, Conor saw an average of 60 each day.   So, for those 2 days he saw 60 x 2 = 120.    Now, let's add 260 and 120 together to get the total number of people.  260 + 120 = 380.   The answer is 380. 
[EXP] 865: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 210, [output]: 20 kernels popped in the first 30 seconds.  Then 20 * 3 = 60 popped in the next 30 seconds, for a total of 20 + 60 = 80.  Then, 4 times the previous rate popped in the next 30 seconds, so 4 * 60 = 240 popped, for a total of 80 + 240 = 320.  Then, in the final 30 seconds, the popping slowed down to half the rate, so 240 / 2 = 120 popped, for a total of 320 + 120 = 440.  Finally, a quarter of the kernels from the last 30 seconds also popped in the residual heat, so 120 / 4 = 30 popped, for a total of 440 + 30 = 470.  The answer is 470. 
[EXP] 866: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Tim wants to make 4 gallons of lemonade.

The number of yellow blocks is twice the blue blocks, which is 2 x 4 = 8.  The number of blue blocks is 4, and the number of yellow blocks is 8, so the number of blue and yellow blocks combined is 4 + 8 = 12.  The total number of blocks is 32, so the number of red blocks must be 32 - 12 = 20.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 870: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 54, [output]: 5 hours driving west for 18mph will be 5 x 18 = 90 miles.  Then, 8 hours driving east at 18mph will be 8 x 18 = 144 miles.  So, Elvis travelled a total of 90 + 144 = 234 miles.  He will be 234 miles away from his house.  Since he drove east for 8 hours after initially driving 5 hours west, he is 234 miles east of his starting point.  The answer is 234. 
[EXP] 871: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 3528, [output]:  The boat originally cost 9000 dollars.  The first year it depreciated by 30%, which means it lost 30% of its value.  30% of 9000 is 2700, so it is now worth 9000 - 2700 = 6300 dollars.  The second year it also depreciated 30%, losing 30% of its current value.  30% of 6300 is 1890, so it is now worth 6300 - 1890 = 4410.  The third year it depreciated 20%, losing 20% of its current value.   20% of 4410 is 882, so it is now worth 4410 - 882 = 3528.  The answer is 3528.

[EXP] 874: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 27, [output]:  Mazie started with 52 marbles.  She gave them to twins Dallas and Darla.  Dallas has 21 marbles left after dropping 4, so he was given 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.  This means Mazie gave Darla the remaining marbles, which is 52 - 25 = 27.   The answer is 27. 
[EXP] 875: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 38, [output]: 1st, let's figure out how much the tickets cost.  There are 3 people (2 adults and 1 child).  2 adults at $12 each cost 2 x 12 = 24 dollars.  1 child at $8 cost 8 dollars.   The total cost of the tickets is 24 + 8 = 32 dollars. 

Then, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each.  2 x 3 is 6.  The cost of the popcorns is 6 dollars. 

The total amount the family pays is the cost of the tickets plus the cost of the popcorns.  32 + 6 is 38.  

So, the family pays 38 dollars in total.  The answer is 38.

[EXP] 880: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 180, [output]: 3 pieces for each place setting, and there are 12 people, so Avery needs 12 * 3 = 36 pieces. 12 dinner plates at $6. 00 each would cost 12 x 6 = 72.  12 bowls at $5. 00 each would cost 12 x 5 = 60.   And 12 salad plates at $4. 00 each would cost 12 x 4 = 48.    72 + 60 + 48 = 180.  The answer is 180. 
[EXP] 881: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 7, [output]:  Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.  Anna took 2 more hours than half Steve's time.   Half of Steve's time is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.   So Anna took 5 + 2 = 7 hours to finish the puzzle.  The answer is 7. 
[EXP] 882: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 20, [output]:  Dexter has 5 pigs that eat 4 pounds of feed, twice a day.  So each pig eats 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of feed a day. 5 pigs would eat 8 * 5 = 40 pounds of feed a day.  For a week, they would eat 40 pounds * 7 days = 280 pounds of feed.  Dexter ordered 300 pounds of feed, so there is 300 - 280 = 20 pounds left.  The answer is 20. 
[EXP] 883: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]: 20 people eating 2 hot dogs each is 20 * 2 = 40 hot dogs. 4 hot dogs are already available.  So John needs 40 - 4 = 36 hot dogs.  If a pack has 6 hot dogs and costs $2, then that means John needs 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs. 6 packs of hot dogs will cost 6 * 2 = 12 dollars.  The answer is 12 dollars. 
[EXP] 884: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  We can break this down step by step:

1.  Frances sells 20 cupcakes for $2 each.  So she earns 20 x 2 = 40 dollars from cupcakes. 
2.  She sells 40 cookies at $1 each.  So she earns 40 x 1 = 40 dollars from cookies.  In total, she earns 40 + 40 = 80 dollars from selling food.  So, she has 80 dollars.  Then, she buys five trays for 4 dollars each.  So, she spends 5 x 4 = 20 dollars.  80 - 20 gives us 60.  The answer is 60. 
[EXP] 885: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 25, [output]: 5 children started following the truck.  On the second street, each of the 5 original children is joined by another child.  So 5 x 1 = 5 more children join.  5 + 5 = 10 children.  On the third street, each of the 10 children is joined by 2 more children.  So 10 x 2 = 20 more children join.  10 + 20 = 30 children.  But the original 5 children give up and leave the group, so 30 - 5 = 25 children remain following the truck.  The answer is 25. 
[EXP] 886: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1218, [output]: 1360 meals were distributed in total.  She distributed 64 on Friday, 30 on Saturday, and 48 on Sunday, so that is 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals given out. 1360 - 142 = 1218.  The answer is 1218. 
[EXP] 887: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 105, [output]: 1 quarter is worth 25 cents. 2 nickels are worth 2 x 5 = 10 cents.  7 dimes are worth 7 x 10 = 70 cents.  So James has 25 + 10 + 70 = 105 cents.  The answer is 105. 
[EXP] 888: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 84, [output]:  There are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.  The 3 sisters are the same age, which is 16.  The older brother is 2 times the age of the younger brother, who is 12.   So the older brother is 12 x 2 = 24 years old.  So the total age of the brothers is 12 + 24 = 36.  The total age of the sisters is 3 x 16 = 48.  The total age of all siblings is 36 + 48 = 84.  The answer is 84.

[EXP] 893: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 67, [output]:  Let's start by using what we know about Albert's height.  We know Albert is 36" tall.  Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, Anne must be 2 x 36 = 72" tall.  We know Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so Jackie must be 72 - 2 = 70" tall now.  Jackie grew 3" over the summer, so before the summer, Jackie was 70 - 3 = 67" tall.  The answer is 67. 
[EXP] 894: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 140000, [output]: 5000 bars per day, for 14 days, is 5000 * 14 = 70,000 bars. 70,000 bars at 2 dollars per bar is 70,000 * 2 = 140,000 dollars.  The answer is 140,000. 
[EXP] 895: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 36, [output]:  Jake is shopping at a clothing store.  The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts.   Jake buys 2 T-shirts.   The original price of each T-shirt is $8.   So the first T-shirt costs $8, and the second one is 50% off. 50% of $8 is $4, so the second T-shirt will be 8 - 4 = $4.  The total cost of the T-shirts is 8 + 4 = 12.  Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price.   The original price of the shoes is $40.   40% of $40 is $16, so the discount on the shoes is $16.    After the discount, the cost of the shoes is 40 - 16 = $24.  In total, Jake buys 12 dollars worth of T-shirts and 24 dollars worth of shoes.   12 + 24 is 36.  The answer is 36. 
[EXP] 896: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Ryan started with an allowance of 6 dollars per week, and he did his chores for 3 weeks. 6 * 3 is 18 dollars.  Then he bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at 1. 25 each.  That is 5 cones at 1. 25 each, or 6. 25 dollars.  After that, he has 18 - 6. 25 dollars left.   18 - 6.  25 is 11.   25 dollars are left.  Now, tickets to the movies cost 6.   5 dollars each.  We can figure out how many tickets he can buy by dividing the money left by 6.   25 ÷ 6 = 4, remainder 1.  He has 1 dollar left after buying 4 movie tickets.  The answer is 4. 
[EXP] 897: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 335, [output]:  Ellen bought a pair of leggings for $100 and a photo frame for $5. 100 + 5 = 105.  Lani bought a pair of sunglasses for $30 and two bathrobes for $100 each. 30 + 200 = 230.  Ellen and Lani together spent 105 + 230 = 335.  The answer is 335. 
[EXP] 898: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 60, [output]:  Let's break down what's needed for one jar of the mixture:

* Passion fruit: 2 pounds x $6 per pound = $12
* Jackfruit: 1. 5 pounds x $8 per pound = $12
* Honey: 2 pounds x $10 per pound = $20
* Total cost: $12 + $12 + $20 = $44

He makes 1 jar by selling it for $50.  So his profit per jar is:

$50 (revenue) - $44 (cost) = $6

If he sells 10 jars, his total revenue will be:

$50 x 10 = $500

His total cost for 10 jars will be:

$44 x 10 = $440

His total profit for 10 jars will be:

$500 (revenue) - $440 (cost) = $60

The answer is $60. 
[EXP] 899: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]: 32 quarters is the same as 8 dollars (32/4 = 8).  95 dimes is the same as 9. 5 dollars (95/10 = 9. 5).  120 nickels is the same as 6 dollars (120/20 = 6).  750 pennies is the same as 7. 5 dollars (750/100 = 7. 5).  So if you add it all up, you get 8 + 9. 5 + 6 + 7. 5, which is 31 dollars.  The answer is 31. 
[EXP] 900: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Janet starts with 40 dollars.  She spends 3. 50 on ice cream, 7. 50 on movie tickets for herself, and 7. 50 on movie tickets for her sister, and 8. 50 on a bracelet.   To get the amount spent, we will do: 3.  50 + 7.  50 + 7. 50 + 8. 50.  That equals 26.   So she has 40 - 26 = 14 dollars left.  The answer is 14. 
[EXP] 901: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 120, [output]: 7 days per week except for 2 days (Sunday and Wednesday).  So he is open 7 - 2 = 5 days a week. 

Each day he services 3 cars, so he services 3 * 5 = 15 cars in a week. 

Each car pays $4, so he makes $4 * 15 = $60 per week.  He works for 2 weeks, so he makes 2 * 60 = $120 in 2 weeks.  The answer is 120. 
[EXP] 902: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 23, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

1.  Randy has 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies initially. 
2.  He eats 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor.  This means he eats 1 oatmeal cookie, 1 chocolate chip cookie, and 1 sugar cookie.  So, he has 8 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 4 sugar cookies after this.  
3.   He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch, so he is left with 8 - 2 = 6 oatmeal cookies.  
4.   He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends, so he is left with 4 - 2 = 2 sugar cookies.  And he has 3 chocolate chip cookies.  So, he has 6 oatmeal cookies, 3 chocolate chip cookies, and 2 sugar cookies.  
5.    He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner.   So, he now has 6 oatmeal cookies + 4 oatmeal cookies = 10 oatmeal cookies.  He has 3 chocolate chip cookies + 4 chocolate chip cookies = 7 chocolate chip cookies.  And he has 2 sugar cookies + 4 sugar cookies = 6 sugar cookies.  In total, he has 10 oatmeal cookies + 7 chocolate chip cookies + 6 sugar cookies = 23 cookies.  The answer is 23. 
[EXP] 903: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Matthew has a collection of 12 unique toy soldiers. 12 is the total number, but it is divided into two parts: half (6) for 5 dollars each, and half (6) for 7 dollars each. 6 toys for 5 dollars each will get him 6 * 5 = 30 dollars. 6 toys for 7 dollars each will get him 6 * 7 = 42 dollars. 30 + 42 = 72.  The answer is 72. 
[EXP] 904: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4, [output]:  First, we need to calculate the total number of holes the dog dug.  He digged 6 holes per day for 14 days.  6 * 14 = 84 holes.  So initially there are 84 holes.  Nate starts filling in 9 holes per day.  But the dog digs 6 new holes every night.  So every day, 9 - 6 = 3 holes are filled in.   To fill in 84 holes, it will take 84 / 3 = 28 days.  There are 7 days in a week, so we can divide 28 by 7. 28 ÷ 7 = 4.  The answer is 4 weeks. 
[EXP] 905: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1000, [output]:  Norman High School enrolls an average of 4000 students.  Butler High School enrolls 3/4 as many students, which is 4000 * 3/4 = 3000 students.  To find how much greater, we subtract. 4000 - 3000 = 1000.  The answer is 1000. 
[EXP] 906: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2325, [output]: 7995 cookies were made. 2595 were rainbow cookies, and 3075 were oatmeal cookies. 2595 + 3075 = 5670. 7995 - 5670 = 2325. 2325 are chocolate chip cookies.  The answer is 2325. 
[EXP] 907: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  Dr.  Hugo Grumpus and his assistant Igor needed 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.  Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he got 16 / 2 = 8 test tubes.  Igor got 2 more petri dishes than requested, so he got 14 + 2 = 16 petri dishes.  We don't know how many beakers Igor lost, so let's call that number x.  So, in total Igor placed on the bench 8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29.  8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 is the same as 31 - x = 29.  If we add x to both sides, we get 31 = 29 + x.  If we subtract 29 from both sides, we get 2 = x.   So Igor lost 2 beakers.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 908: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]: 4 tables with 4 legs each means there are 4 * 4 = 16 legs.  Each leg needs 2 screws, so 16 legs need 16 * 2 = 32 screws.  James has 40 screws originally.   After using 32, he will have 40 - 32 = 8 screws left.  The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 909: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 30, [output]:  There are originally 10 eggs in a basket.  A second basket has twice as many eggs, so it has 10 x 2 = 20 eggs.  In total, both baskets have 10 + 20 = 30 eggs.  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 910: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  Let's start with Alexandra.  She raises 430.   Kim raises 320 more than Alexandra.   So, Kim raises 430 + 320 = 750.   Maryam raises 400 more than Sarah.   Sarah raises 300.   So, Maryam raises 300 + 400 = 700.  Together, Alexandra and Kim raise 430 + 750 = 1180.  And together, Sarah and Maryam raise 300 + 700 = 1000.   So, in total, they raise 1180 + 1000 = 2180.  The answer is 2180. 
[EXP] 911: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 64, [output]:  Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa, but Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron.  So Aaron ran 1/2 the distance as Vanessa.  If Aaron completed 1/2 the distance in 16 minutes, then Vanessa completed 4 miles in twice that time. 

1/2 * 4 = 2, and 2 * 16 = 32.  So it would take Vanessa 32 minutes to complete her part.   The answer is 32. 
[EXP] 912: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 594, [output]:  The caretaker already has 6 feet of new line.  200 feet of dock will require 200 * 3 = 600 feet of line.  He needs a total of 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.  The answer is 594. 
[EXP] 913: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 180, [output]:  Let's calculate the revenue per night:

2 meals x $5 each = $10
1 bottle of wine x $5 = $5
Total revenue per night = $10 + $5 = $15

Since they make $15 per night and are open 2 days a week, they make a total of:

$15 x 2 = $30 per week

So, Tom's restaurant makes $30 per week.  (by the way, I'm assuming they don't tip, as it's a bit tricky to calculate tips and I was asked to follow previous examples without it).  The answer is 30. 
[EXP] 914: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]: 080 Euros

First, we need to find the total amount of money the fruit vendor had after selling all the watermelons.  The profit is 25%, so he sold each watermelon for 25% more than the original price.  So we need to find the selling price of each watermelon.  He originally had $80.  $80 was 50 watermelons for 80 dollars.   80/50 = 1. 60 watermelon is 80 dollars.  We need to add 25% to each watermelon.  To add 25%, we add 1/4.    1/4 of 80 dollars = 20 dollars.  $80 + $20 = $100 dollars.  50 watermelons for 100 dollars.  100/50 = 2.   $2 is each watermelon.  The answer is 2. 
[EXP] 915: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 8, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

1.  James is now twice as old as his sister Dora, who will turn 12 in 3 years.  To find out James' current age, we need to find out Dora's current age.  Since she will turn 12 in 3 years, she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.  James is twice as old as her, so he is 9 * 2 = 18 years old. 
2.   John had a son James when he was 19.  This means that James is currently 18 - 19 = -1 year old.  Wait, what?  This can't be!  It means that the problem is trying to trick us.   Let's look again at the problem: "John had a son James when he was 19. "  This means that John was 19 years old when James was born.  And we already know that James is 18 years old.  So, John is 19 + 18 = 37 years old now.  A son born when John was 32 is therefore currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.  In 3 years, he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.   The answer is 8. 
[EXP] 916: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]:  Ana and Jane start at the same time.  Ana peels an orange every 3 minutes and Jane peels an orange every 4 minutes.  In an hour, there are 60 minutes.  So, in an hour, Ana can peel 60 ÷ 3 = 20 oranges.  In an hour, Jane can peel 60 ÷ 4 = 15 oranges.  So, Ana has 20 - 15 = 5 more oranges peeled than Jane.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 917: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]: 80% off means 400 - (80/100 * 400) = 400 - 320 = 80 dollars. 80 dollars for the radiator. 3 hours of mechanic time for 50 dollars an hour will be 3 x 50 = 150 dollars. 80 + 150 is 230.  The answer is 230. 
[EXP] 918: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 20 animals are either chickens or cows. 70 legs in total.  The number of legs of a chicken is 2.  The number of legs of a cow is 4. 

We let the number of chickens be x and the number of cows be 20 - x because the total number of animals is 20.  Then, we can write the equation 2x + 4(20 - x) = 70 for the total number of legs.  Distribution of the parenthesis can make the equation 2x + 80 - 4x = 70.  Moving all terms to the left side, we get -2x + 80 = 70.   Then add 2x to both sides, and 80 = 70 + 2x to get 2x = 10.  Finally, divide by 2 and we find that x = 5.  So the number of chickens is 5, and the number of cows is 15.  The answer is 5. 
[EXP] 919: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 14, [output]: 7 pizzas cut into 8 slices each will be a total of 7 * 8 = 56 slices. 4 people (Henry and his 3 friends) will share the pizzas. 56 slices / 4 people is 56 / 4 = 14 slices.  The answer is 14.

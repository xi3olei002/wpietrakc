1.  Adrien's total salary 4 years ago was $40000. 
2.  His salary was 30% higher than Lylah's.  
We can find Lylah's salary by finding 30% of $40000 and subtracting it from Adrien's salary:
$40000 x 0. 30 = $12000
$40000 - $12000 = $28000
Lylah's salary 4 years ago was $28000. 
3.  Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%.  We can calculate the percent increase by finding 40% of his original salary:
$40000 x 0. 40 = $16000
Add this increase to his original salary:
$40000 + $16000 = $56000
4.  Likewise, we can find Lylah's new salary by finding the percent increase and adding it to her original salary:
Lylah's original salary was $28000.  The percent increase is 40%:
$28000 x 0. 40 = $11200
Add this increase to her original salary:
$28000 + $11200 = $39200

They spent $20. 25 on tickets and $4. 50 less on food.  So they spent $20. 25 - $4. 50 = $15. 75 on food. 

Total cost for tickets and food = $20. 25 + $15. 75 = $36. 00

They also spent $33 on each of 2 rides, which is 2 x $33 = $66. 

Total cost including rides = $36. 00 + $66. 00 = $102. 00

Since there are 3 friends, they will divide the total cost equally.  To find out how much each friend paid, we can divide the total cost by 3:

$102. 00 / 3 = $34. 00

Each friend pays $34. 00.

[EXP] 31: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 10, [output]: 1.  Define the variables: 
Let x be the number of times Sara mows the lawn. 

2.  Calculate the total amount of money Sara can earn: 
She will earn 5 dollars 4 times from babysitting, so that is 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.  She will also earn x * 4 = x * 4 dollars from mowing the lawn.  Adding those together gives us 20 + x * 4 dollars. 

3.  Calculate how much money Sara needs to buy the jacket and shoes: 
The jacket costs 30 dollars and 2 pairs of shoes cost 20 dollars each, so that is 2 * 20 = 40 dollars.  Adding those together gives us 30 + 40 = 70 dollars.  

4.  Calculate how much money Sara will have after she saves up: 
Before starting, Sara has 10 dollars.  After babysitting, she has 10 + 20 = 30 dollars.  After earning additional money from mowing the lawn, she has 30 + (20 + x * 4) dollars. 

5.  Set the equation: 
The equation is 30 + (20 + x * 4) = 70.  

6.  Solve the equation: 
This equation is an addition equation, and the right-hand side is a constant (70).  The equation is 30 + 20 + x * 4 = 70.  We first simplify the left-hand side by distributing the multiplication to add 20 + x * 4, which is 20 + 4x.  The equation becomes 30 + 20 + 4x = 70.  We can combine 30 + 20 terms to get 50.  The equation is now 50 + 4x = 70.  To solve for x, we subtract 50 from each side, and we get 4x = 20.  Then, we divide each side by 4, and we get x = 5. 

So, Sara must mow the lawn 5 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes.

We know that Jerry's current age is equal to twice his age 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

We can solve for x by isolating the variable:

x = 2x - 10
x + 10 = 2x
10 = x
x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10 years. 

The problem also asks how old Jerry will be in 3 years.  To find this, we simply add 3 to Jerry's current age:

10 + 3 = 13

Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

[EXP] 110: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 100, [output]:  Let's start by identifying the parts: 

- First house: unknown
- Second house: unknown
- Third house: double the first house

We know that the first house will be 1/2 of the second house, so 
First house + First house = Second house
2 * First house = Second house

We also know that 3 houses will need 250 cases of shingles, so the sum of all the houses is 250:

First house + Second house + Third house = 250

We can replace the second house with 2 * First house:

First house + 2 * First house + Third house = 250

Combine these equations:

2 * First house + First house + Third house = 250

Combine terms:

3 * First house + Third house = 250

Now let's create an equation for the third house, which is double the first house:

Third house = 2 * First house

We can substitute this into the previous equation:

3 * First house + 2 * First house = 250

Combine terms:

5 * First house = 250

Divide by 5:

First house = 50

Since the third house needs double the first house, it will need 2 * 50 = 100 cases of shingles. 

The answer is 100.

[EXP] 112: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 4400, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step. 

Mike has 600 movies.  A third of them are part of a series, and he can get the series for $6 instead of $10.  To find out how many movies are part of a series, we multiply 1/3 by 600:

1/3 x 600 = 200

So 200 movies are part of a series.  The cost for these would normally be 200 x $10 = $2000, but he can get them for $6 each, so the cost is 200 x $6 = $1200. 

The remaining movies are 600 - 200 = 400. 

40% of the remaining movies are older movies, which are $5 each.  To find out how many older movies there are, we multiply 400 by 0. 40:

400 x 0. 40 = 160

So there are 160 older movies.  The cost of these would be 160 x $5 = $800. 

The remaining movies are the ones that aren't part of a series and aren't older movies.  There are 400 - 160 = 240 such movies. 

These movies would normally cost 240 x $10 = $2400, but since Mike needs to replace his entire collection, he'll have to pay that price. 

Adding up the costs:

$1200 (series) + $800 (older movies) + $2400 (remaining movies) = $4400

So replacing the entire movie collection would cost Mike $4400.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's start by using the information that Paul is 10 years older than John.  This means that John's age is Paul's age minus 10. 

Let John's age be x.  Then Paul's age is x + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100, so we can set up the equation:

Peter + Paul + John = 100

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so we can substitute:

Peter = (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10

Now we can substitute this into the equation:

2x + 10 + x + x + 10 = 100

Combine like terms:

4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4x = 80

Divide by 4:

x = 20

So John's age is 20.  Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30. 

Now we can find Peter's age using the fact that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:

Peter = (30) + 20 = 50

The answer is 50.

The question also states that the price of a large stuffed animal is three times the price of a small stuffed animal.  Since each small stuffed animal costs $4, the price of a large stuffed animal would be 3 * 4 = 12. 

The total amount earned by Teresa is $120, which is the sum of the earnings from selling large and small stuffed animals.  The earnings from selling large stuffed animals is the number of large stuffed animals sold times the price of each large stuffed animal: x * 12.  The earnings from selling small stuffed animals is the number of small stuffed animals sold times the price of each small stuffed animal: 2x * 4. 

Since the total earnings is $120, we can set up the equation:

x * 12 + 2x * 4 = 120

Combine like terms:

12x + 8x = 120

20x = 120

Divide both sides by 20:

x = 6

So Teresa sold 6 large stuffed animals.  Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold 2x = 2 * 6 = 12 small stuffed animals.

Initially, the triceratops had some weight, let's call it x. 

The T-Rex ate half of it, so the remaining weight is x/2. 

The velociraptors scavenged half of what was left, which is (x/2)/2 = x/4. 

So, what was left is now x/4, and the Allosaurus gulped down the last 270 kg. 

We can set up an equation: x/4 = 270

To solve for x, multiply both sides by 4: x = 270 x 4 = 1080

So, the triceratops originally weighed 1080 kg.  The answer is 1080.

[EXP] 181: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 5, [output]: 210 photos need to be uploaded.  She can upload 7 photos in 1 batch, and 6 batches each day.  That means she can upload 7 * 6 = 42 photos in one day.  So to find how many days it will take to upload all the photos, we need to divide 210 by 42. 

210 ÷ 42 = 5

So it will take Jade 5 days to upload all her photos.

[EXP] 183: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 38, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

First, they buy tickets for 1 adult and 1 child.  The cost of the adult ticket is $12 and the child ticket is $8.  So the total cost of the tickets is $12 + $8 = $20. 

Then, they buy 2 popcorns for $3 each.  So the total cost of the popcorn is 2 x $3 = $6. 

To find the total amount of money they pay, we add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the popcorn: $20 + $6 = $26. 

The answer is $26.

Ryan spent money on ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends.  He spent 1. 25 x 4 = 5 dollars on ice cream cones.  So he has 18 - 5 dollars left.  18 - 5 is 13. 

Now, he wants to buy movie tickets that cost 6. 50 each.  Let's divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of the movie tickets to see how many he can buy.  13 / 6. 5 = 2.  The answer is 2.

    - Number of snails in the first aquarium: 4
    - Number of snails in the second aquarium: 32
    - Difference: 32 - 4 = 28

* Since the difference is twice the number of fish, let's divide the difference by 2 to get the number of fish:
    - 28 ÷ 2 = 14

* Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, let's say the number of fish in each aquarium is x. 
    - Total number of fish in both aquariums = 2x
    - And since it's equal to 14, we can set up the equation:
        - 2x = 14

* Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:
    - x = 7

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.

[EXP] 37: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 73, [output]: 10 wolves and 15 cougars were killed the previous night.  Therefore, the total number of animals killed previous night is 10 + 15 = 25. 

Since Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars today, the number of wolves killed today is 3 times the number of cougars killed today.  Let the number of cougars killed today be x.  Then the number of wolves killed today is 3x. 

Since Rick killed three fewer cougars today than yesterday, the number of cougars killed today is 15 - 3 = 12. 

So the number of wolves killed today is 3x = 3(12) = 36. 

The total number of animals killed today is the number of wolves killed today plus the number of cougars killed today, which is 36 + 12 = 48. 

Therefore, the total number of animals killed is the total number of animals killed the previous night plus the total number of animals killed today, which is 25 + 48 = 73.

To find out how many cents he spent on candy bars, subtract the amount left from the initial amount: 500 cents - 380 cents = 120 cents. 

Candy bars cost 75 cents each, so to find out how many candy bars he bought, divide the amount he spent on candy bars (120 cents) by the cost of each candy bar (75 cents): 120/75 = 1. 6.  Since he can't buy a fraction of a candy bar, he must have bought 1 candy bar.

Next, the cost of cheese and condiments: The food truck spends $30. 00 on different cheeses and condiments per 10 sandwiches.  So, the cost per sandwich is $3. 00 (=$30. 00 ÷ 10). 

Now, the total cost per sandwich is the sum of the cost of bread and cheese and condiments: $3. 30 (=$0. 30 + $3. 00). 

The food truck sells each sandwich for $7. 00.  To find the net profit, subtract the total cost per sandwich from the selling price per sandwich: $7. 00 - $3. 30 = $3. 70. 

So, the net profit per sandwich is $3. 70.  Since the food truck sold 10 sandwiches, the total net profit is $37. 00 (=$3. 70 x 10).

1.  Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400 in the first month, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.  Let's call the total amount earned from green hats x.  Then, the equation can be written as:

400 = (1/2)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 2:

800 = x

So, Ariadne earned $800 from green hats in the first month. 

2.  The total amount she made in the first month is the sum of the sales from red hats and green hats:

Total first month earnings = 400 (red hats) + 800 (green hats) = $1200

3.  In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  To find the total sales in the second month, we can multiply the total sales of the first month by 3/4:

Second month total earnings = 1200 x (3/4) = $900

4.  Since we want to find the total amount she made in two months, we add the total earnings in both months:

Total earnings in two months = Total first month earnings + Total second month earnings
= 1200 + 900
= $2100

The answer is $2100.

[EXP] 113: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 15, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step!

1.  Andy's car covers a distance of 5 miles one way to his office, so the total distance covered in a day is 10 miles (round-trip).  Since he does this from Monday to Friday, the total distance covered in a week is 10 miles/day * 5 days = 50 miles. 
2.  Since the fuel efficiency is 10 miles per gallon, the amount of fuel consumed in a week is the total distance divided by the fuel efficiency: 50 miles / 10 MPG = 5 gallons. 
3.  The cost of fuel is $3 per gallon, so the total cost of fuel consumed in a week is 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15. 

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $15 per week.

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

Let's say John's age is x.  Then Paul's age is x + 10, because Paul is 10 years older than John. 

We know that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age, so Peter's age is x + (x + 10) = 2x + 10. 

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 10) + (2x + 10) = 100

Combine like terms:

4x + 20 = 100

Subtract 20 from both sides:

4x = 80

Divide both sides by 4:

x = 20

Now we know John's age is 20.  Since Paul is 10 years older than John, Paul's age is 20 + 10 = 30. 

Since Peter's age is the sum of Paul and John's age, Peter's age is 20 + 30 = 50. 

The answer is 50.

$13 ÷ $6. 50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. 
 Voted result:  Let's break this problem down step by step:

1.  Ryan earns $6 each week he completes his chores.  He did his chores for 3 weeks, so he earned:
3 weeks x $6/week = $18

So, Ryan has $18. 

2.  He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends at $1. 25 each.  The total cost is:
4 cones x $1. 25/cone = $5

So, Ryan spent $5 on ice cream cones. 

3.  Subtract the amount spent on ice cream cones from the allowance:
$18 (allowance) - $5 (ice cream cones) = $13

Now, Ryan has $13 left. 

4.  The movie tickets cost $6. 50 each.  How many tickets can Ryan buy with the remaining $13?
$13 ÷ $6. 50 = 2

Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets. 
[EXP] 187: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 72, [output]:  Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers.  For 6 toy soldiers, the price is $5 per toy, so he would get 5 * 6 = $30.  For the other 6 toy soldiers, the price is $7 per toy, so he would get 7 * 6 = $42.  In total, he would get 30 + 42 = 72.  The answer is 72.

[EXP] 188: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 2280, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430.  So Kim raises $430 + $320 = $750. 

Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300.  So Maryam raises $300 + $400 = $700. 

In total, they raised $430 + $750 + $700 + $300 = $1880. 

The answer is 1880 dollars.

[EXP] 189: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 230, [output]:  First, Mark originally needed to pay $400 for a new radiator, but since it's 80% off, he got a discount of 80% x 400 = 320.  So he paid $400 - $320 = $80 for the radiator.  Then, the mechanic took 3 hours to install it, and 3 hours at $50 an hour is 3 x 50 = 150.  So he also paid $150 for the installation.  In total, he paid $80 + $150 = $230.  The answer is 230.

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2x = 14

[EXP] 18: [success_rate]: False, [answer]: 95200, [output]: 4 years ago, Adrien was making 40000 dollars. His salary then was 40 percent higher than Lylah's. Let's call Lylah's salary at that time L. Then Adrien's salary was L + 0.4L = 1.4L.

We know that 1.4L = 40000, so L = 40000 / 1.4 = 28571.7. Round down to 28571, since salary can't be a fraction. This is Lylah's salary at that time.


Now, let's think of percentages. The amount of increase as a percentage is the same as the ratio of the increase to its initial value. The amount of increase for Adrien's salary at that time was 40000 - 28571.7 = 11428.3. The ratio of this increase to his initial salary is 11428.3 / 28571.7 = 0.4 (which is 40%).

Now, we have both the initial and the final salaries for Adrien and Lylah. Adrien's salary four years ago was 40000, and increase rate was 0.4. So, Adrien's salary four years later is 1.4 * 40000 = 56000.


Lylah's salary four years ago was 28571.7. Her increase rate was the same as Adrien's, so it was 0.4. Lylah's salary four years later is 0.4 * 28571.7 + 28571.7 = 34288.8.

2.  Mark is 2 years older than Jean two years ago, so Jean was 9 - 2 = 7 years old two years ago.

3.  Jean's age now is two more than the age she was two years ago, so Jean is 7 + 2 = 9 now.

So, Jean is 9 years old.
[EXP] 28: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 34, [output]: 3 friends spent $20.25 on tickets. Then they spent 4.50 less on food. So they spent 20.25 - 4.5 = 15.75 on food.

They also went on 2 rides that cost $33 each, so 2 x 33 = 66. In total, they spent 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102.

Since they split the cost evenly, each person paid 102 ÷ 3 = 34. The answer is 34.

[EXP] 30: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 31, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step!

1. For lunch, Carl ate a sandwich for 7 days (one for each day of the week). Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese, so that's 2 x 7 = 14 slices.
2. For breakfast, Carl ate omelets for 3 days, using 1 slice of cheese more per omelet than the sandwich. So that's 3 omelets x 3 slices per omelet = 9 additional slices.
3. In total, for sandwiches and omelets, Carl used 14 + 9 = 23 slices of cheese.
4. For dinner, Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.

To find the total number of slices of cheese Carl used, add the number of slices used for lunch and breakfast to the number used for dinner:

23 (slices for sandwiches and omelets) + 8 (slices for macaroni and cheese) = 31

So, Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese this week.

Sara already had $10 in savings, so she needs $70 - $10 = $60 more. 2. Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's kids, so to find out how many times she must babysit to earn $5, we can set up the equation: 5x = 60 and solve for x: x = 12. So Sara must babysit 12 times.

Since the difference is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, we can set up an equation:

28 = 2x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 28/2
x = 14

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

[EXP] 40: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 315, [output]:  To solve this problem, let's start by breaking it down into smaller parts. The body of the sweater is 900 stitches. The collar is a tenth of that number, which is 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette is twice as many as the collar, so it is 90 x 2 = 180 stitches. The total number of stitches is 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170. Since the total number of stitches is 1800, that means there are 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches remaining. This must be for the two sleeves. Since there are two sleeves, we divide 630 by 2 to get the number of stitches for each sleeve. 630 / 2 is 315. The answer is 315.

Kenny used part of his earnings for the amusement park ticket that was 100 dollars. So we need to find how many cards he started with and what amount was left after he got the 50 dollars. 

Another thing to note is he gives this amount to himself. That money is taken from his earnings. He didn't buy the ticket with someone else's money. So his remaining cards amount after selling will be his card earnings minus the amusement park cost. 

Let the cards be X. Then, we know Kenny gets back $(X * 1.5) - 100 = 50 dollars. 

We subtract 100 in this because the money he used for amusement park is not returned back to him. 

The equation is (X * 1.5) - 100 = 50.

Add 100 on both sides of the equation, it will become (X * 1.5) = 150.

Now divide both sides of the equation by 1.5, it will become X = 100.

[EXP] 66: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 1920, [output]:  Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we need to find out the volume of soil needed for each bed. The dimensions of each bed are 2 feet by 8 feet by 2 feet. To find the volume, we multiply the three dimensions:

2 ft * 8 ft * 2 ft = 32 cubic feet

So, each bed requires 32 cubic feet of potting soil.

Since there are 10 raised beds, we need to multiply the volume per bed by the number of beds:

32 cubic feet/bed * 10 beds = 320 cubic feet of soil needed in total

Since each bag of potting soil holds 2 cubic feet of soil, we'll need:

320 cubic feet / 2 cubic feet/bag = 160 bags of potting soil

Finally, each bag of potting soil costs $12. To find the total cost, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:

160 bags * $12/bag = $1920

So, the potting soil will cost Bob $1920.

We know that beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice. To find the combined cooking time, we add the cooking times of rice and pork:
30 (rice) + 50 (pork) = 80 minutes

Now, to find the cooking time of beans, we divide the combined cooking time by 2:

Since the pork took 50 minutes, adding 30 minutes for rice, and 40 minutes for beans, we get:

He gets 100 music files for 1/2 * 10 = 5 dollars each, so that is 5 x 100 = 500 dollars. 40% of the remaining movies are older movies which cost 5 dollars, so, 600 - 100 = 500. 40% of 500 is 40/100 * 500 = 200. These 200 are 5 dollars each, so he needs to pay 5 x 200 = 1000 dollars. For the 100 series movies, it is 5 dollars, so 5 x 100 = 500. In total, Mike has to pay 500 + 1000 + 500 = 2000 dollars.

Then his wage increases by $0.50, so his new wage is $10.50 per hour. For 20 hours, he will earn $10.50 x 20 = $210.

One month later, his wage increases again by $1, to $11.50 per hour. For 20 hours, he will earn $11.50 x 20 = $230.

Billy's total wages in all are $400 + $210 + $230 = $840.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary, so her starting salary is $10.50. For 20 hours, her wages will be $10.50 x 20 = $210.

Since Billy earns $840 and Sally earns $210, Billy earns $840 - $210 = $630 more than Sally.

3. Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age, so we can write an equation: Peter's age = (x + 10) + x = 2x + 10.
4. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100, so we can set up an equation: x + (x + 10) + (2x + 10) = 100.
5. Combine like terms: 4x + 20 = 100.
6. Subtract 20 from both sides: 4x = 80.
7. Divide both sides by 4: x = 20.

Now that we know Jean's age is 20, we can find Paul's age: Paul's age = x + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30.

And finally, we can find Peter's age: Peter's age = 2x + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50.

[EXP] 147: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 12, [output]:  Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, let's assume she sold x large stuffed animals. Then she sold 2x small ones. Let's say each large one costs a and each small one costs b. Since small ones cost 4, b = 4.

Since Teresa earned $120 from the sales, the equation can be set up as follows:

3x*a + 2x*b = 120

Since b = 4, the equation becomes:

3x*a + 2x*4 = 120

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3a + 8x = 120

Now we need to find x. Since Teresa sold twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones, x = 2y where y is the number of large stuffed animals sold.

So, 3a + 8x = 120 becomes:

3a + 8*2y = 120

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

1.5a + 4y = 60

Since Teresa sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, the price of a large stuffed animal is 3b = 3*4 = 12.

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1.5*12 + 4y = 60

Simplifying, we get:

18 + 4y = 60

Subtracting 18 from both sides:

4y = 42

Dividing by 4:

y = 10.5

So, x = 2y = 21.

This means Teresa sold 21 large stuffed animals. Since she sold twice as many small ones, she sold 21*2 = 42 small ones.

We are told that Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. We can write this as follows:

Brownies = 3 * Cupcakes - 2

Since we know that the total number of treats is 10, we can set up an equation:

Cupcakes + (3 * Cupcakes - 2) = 10

Combine like terms:

4 * Cupcakes = 12

Divide both sides by 4:

Cupcakes = 3

So Carly made 3 cups of cupcakes. The answer is 3.

So without any interruptions, it would take 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to complete the download.  But because she has to restart the download, we have to consider the time for the restart as well. 

At first, Carla downloaded 40% of the file.  40% of 200 is 80 GB.  So she downloaded 80 GB before the restart.  This took her 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.

The second half of the year is also 6 months.  For this part, the company charges 10% less than the initial price.  To calculate 10% of the initial price, we multiply $140 by 0. 10, which is $14.  So, the new monthly price is $140 - $14 = $126.  The total cost for the second half of the year is 6 months x $126 = $756. 

To find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we add the cost for the first half and the second half.  $840 + $756 = $1596.  The answer is $1596.

Next, they get 20 glasses per gallon and sell each glass for $0. 50.  To find the revenue per gallon, multiply the number of glasses per gallon by the price per glass: 20 glasses/gallon x $0. 50/glass = $10/gallon. 

Now, let's find the profit per gallon.  Revenue per gallon minus cost per gallon gives the profit per gallon: $10/gallon - $5/gallon = $5/gallon. 

Since the total profit is $25, and each gallon makes a profit of $5, they must have made 25/5 = 5 gallons. 

Since they spent $5 per gallon on lemons, they spent 5 gallons x $3 per gallon = $15 on lemons.

1.  The total cost of the 3 tickets is $20. 25. 
2.  The cost of food is $4. 50 less than the cost of the tickets, so the cost of food is $20. 25 - $4. 50 = $15. 75. 
3.  The total cost of the fair is the cost of the tickets and food: $20. 25 + $15. 75 = $36. 00. 
4.  The cost of the 2 rides is $33. 00 for each ride, so the total cost of the rides is $33. 00 x 2 = $66. 00. 
5.  The total cost of the fair is the sum of the cost of the tickets, food, and rides: $36. 00 + $66. 00 = $102. 00. 
6.  To find out how much each friend paid, we need to divide the total cost by the number of friends (3): $102. 00 ÷ 3 = $34. 00. 

So each friend paid $34. 00 in total.

[EXP] 85: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 52, [output]:  Let's break it down step by step. 

Jared starts with a typing speed of 47 WPM.  Then his speed increases to 52 WPM, which means he increased his speed by 52 - 47 = 5 WPM. 

After increasing his speed once more by 5 WPM, we can find his new typing speed by adding 5 to 52: 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

Now, we have three measurements: 47, 52, and 57.  To find the average, we need to add them up and divide by 3:

47 + 52 + 57 = 156

156 / 3 = 52

[EXP] 86: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 13, [output]:  Let's break this problem down step by step. 

Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago.  This means that if his current age is x, his age 5 years ago was x - 5. 

Since Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago, his current age is 2(x - 5). 

We can set up an equation:

x = 2(x - 5)

Simplifying the equation:

x = 2x - 10

Subtracting 2x from both sides:

-x = -10

Adding 10 to both sides:

x = 10

So Jerry's current age is 10. 

To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we can add 3 to his current age:

10 + 3 = 13

[EXP] 94: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2100, [output]:  Let's start by analyzing the first month's sales. 

Ariadne earned $400 from selling red hats, which is half the total amount she earned from selling green hats.  Let's call the total amount she earned from selling green hats "x".  Then, the equation can be written as:

400 = x/2

To find the total amount she earned from selling green hats, we can multiply both sides by 2:

x = 400 * 2
x = 800

So, Ariadne earned $800 from selling green hats in the first month.  Her total earnings from hats in the first month are the sum of red and green hat sales:

Total earnings in the first month = $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month.  We can set up an equation to represent this:

Total earnings in the second month = 3/4 * $1200
Total earnings in the second month = $900

Since the problem asks for the total amount she made in two months, we can add the earnings from both months:

Total earnings in two months = $1200 (first month) + $900 (second month) = $2100

The answer is $2100.

The number of votes in favor is stated to be twice the number of votes against.  Let the number of votes against be x.  Then the number of votes in favor is 2x. 

The total number of votes is the sum of votes in favor and against: x + 2x = 33. 

Combine like terms: 3x = 33. 

Divide by 3: x = 11. 

So the number of votes against is 11.  The number of votes in favor is twice this amount, which is 2 * 11 = 22.

Now, we can say x + x/2 + x/4 = 250.  To make the calculation easier, we can multiply all the terms by 4 to get 4x + 2x + x = 1000.  This simplifies to 7x = 1000.  Dividing both sides by 7 gives us x = 143.

Billy's original rate was $10 per hour.  After 2 months, he was given a raise of $0. 50 per hour.  So after the raise, his rate was $10 + $0. 50 = $10. 50.  After his first anniversary, he was given a raise of $1. 00 per hour.  So after the second raise, his rate was $10. 50 + $1. 00 = $11. 50. 

Now we need to find Sally's starting rate.  Her rate is $0. 50 more per hour than Billy's original rate, which is $10 per hour.  So Sally's rate was $10 + $0. 50 = $10. 50. 

Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.  To find their salaries, we multiply their rates by the number of hours they work: 

* Billy's salary after his new rate is $11. 50 per hour: 20 hours * $11. 50 per hour = $230
* Sally's salary at her rate is $10. 50 per hour: 20 hours * $10. 50 per hour = $210

[EXP] 134: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 50, [output]:  Let's break this down step by step.  

The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old.  This means that Peter's age plus Paul's age plus Jean's age equals 100.  Let's set that up algebraically as:

Peter + Paul + Jean = 100

We know Paul is 10 years older than Jean, so we can express that as an equation:

Paul = Jean + 10

We're also told that Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's ages.  This can be written as:

Peter = Paul + Jean

Now we have three equations:

Peter + Paul + Jean = 100
Paul = Jean + 10
Peter = Paul + Jean

We can substitute the expression for Paul from the second equation into the first equation:

Peter + (Jean + 10) + Jean = 100

Combine like terms:

Peter + 2Jean + 10 = 100

Subtract 10 from both sides:

Peter + 2Jean = 90

Now we can substitute the expression for Peter from the third equation into this equation:

(Paul + Jean) + 2Jean = 90

Combine like terms:

Paul + 3Jean = 90

Now we're down to just two variables, Paul and Jean.  We can use the second equation to express Paul in terms of Jean:

Paul = Jean + 10

Substitute this into the equation:

(Jean + 10) + 3Jean = 90

Combine like terms:

4Jean + 10 = 90

Subtract 10 from both sides:

4Jean = 80

Divide by 4:

Jean = 20

Now we can find Paul and Peter. 

Jean = 20
Paul = Jean + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
Peter = Paul + Jean = 30 + 20 = 50

So Peter's age is 50.  The answer is 50.

But 4 people said they could not come, so the actual number of guests is 45 - 4 = 41.  41 guests are more than 20, so we charge extra for each of 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.  21 x $6 = $126.

Then the velociraptors ate half of what was left, so they ate half of X/2, which is X/4.  So the amount of meat left for the Allosaurus is X/2 - X/4 = X/4.   Since the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, this must be equal to X/4.  So X/4 = 270, or X = 4 * 270 = 1080.  This is the number of kilograms of meat that the triceratops had before the T-Rex ate.

[EXP] 158: [success_rate]: True, [answer]: 2, [output]:  To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes to ride each slide, then subtract the shorter time from the longer time to find the difference. 

The time it takes to ride the biggest slide:
Distance = 300 feet
Rate = 60 feet/minute
Time = Distance / Rate = 300 / 60 = 5 minutes

The time it takes to ride the second biggest slide:
Distance = 240 feet
Rate = 80 feet/minute
Time = Distance / Rate = 240 / 80 = 3 minutes

Difference in time:
Longest slide = 5 minutes
Second longest slide = 3 minutes
Difference = 5 - 3 = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.

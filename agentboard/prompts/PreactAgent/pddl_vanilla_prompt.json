After the pickup action, the arm will be holding the block, and the block will no longer be on the table or clear.\n    putdown <block>: allows the arm to put down a block on the table if it is holding a block. After the putdown action, the arm will be empty, and the block will be on the table and clear.\n    stack <block> <block>: allows the arm to stack a block on top of another block if the arm is holding the top block and the bottom block is clear.

    "examples": ["To generate a path from node 61 to 92 using the given graph and edges, you can follow these steps:\nStart at node 61. Look for edges that connect node 61 to other nodes. From the given edges, we find the edge (61, 46). Move to node 46. From node 46, check the available edges. We find two edges: (46, 61) and (46, 98).Since we want to reach node 92, we choose the edge that leads us closer to that goal. Therefore, move to node 98. From node 98, examine the edges. We find three edges: (98, 66), (98, 46), and (98, 77).Again, choose the edge that brings us closer to node 92. Move to node 77.From node 77, check the available edges. We find the edge (77, 37). Move to node 37. From node 37, examine the edges. We find the edge (37, 97). Move to node 97. From node 97, check the available edges. We find two edges: (97, 84) and (97, 37). Move to node 84. From node 84, examine the edges. We find the edge (84, 95). Move to node 95. From node 95, check the available edges. We find three edges: (95, 88), (95, 84), and (95, 66). Move to node 88. From node 88, examine the edges. We find two edges: (88, 95) and (88, 82). Move to node 82. From node 82, check the available edges. We find two edges: (82, 74) and (82, 93). Move to node 93. From node 93, examine the edges. We find three edges: (93, 82), (93, 84), and (93, 42). Move to node 92. We have reached the goal node 92.\n\nTherefore, the generated path from node 61 to 92, using the given graph and edges, is: [61, 46, 98, 77, 37, 97, 84, 95, 88, 82, 93, 92].\nAnwer:[61, 46, 98, 77, 37, 97, 84, 95, 88, 82, 93, 92]"],
